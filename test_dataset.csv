it is derived from acridine.  commercial preparations are often mixtures with proflavine. it is known by a variety of commercial names.


== uses ==


=== medical use ===
acriflavine was developed in 1912 by paul ehrlich, a german medical researcher, and was used during the first world war against sleeping sickness and as a topical antiseptic.


=== other uses ===
acriflavine is used in biochemistry for fluorescently labeling high molecular weight rna.it is used as treatment for external fungal infections of aquarium fish.


== research ==
in an animal model, acriflavine has been shown to inhibit hif-1, which prevents blood vessels growing to supply tumors with blood and interferes with glucose uptake and use.acriflavine might be effective in fighting common cold virus, and also aid the fight against increasingly antibiotic resistant bacteria  because it can cure (remove) plasmids containing antimicrobial resistance genes from gram positive bacteria.since 2014, acriflavine has been undergoing testing as an antimalarial drug to treat parasites with resistance to quinine and modern anti-parasitic medicines.

tripartite motif-containing protein 59 isoform 1 (human),protein,"tripartite motif-containing 24 (trim24) also known as transcriptional intermediary factor 1α (tif1α) is a protein that, in humans, is encoded by the trim24 gene.


== function ==
the protein encoded by this gene mediates transcriptional control by interaction with the activation function 2 (af2) region of several nuclear receptors, including the estrogen, retinoic acid, and vitamin d3 receptors. the protein localizes to nuclear bodies and is thought to associate with chromatin and heterochromatin-associated factors. the protein is a member of the tripartite motif (trim) family. the trim motif includes three zinc-binding domains – a ring, a b-box type 1 and a b-box type 2 – and a coiled-coil region. two alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene.


== interactions ==
trim24 has been shown to interact with mineralocorticoid receptor, trim33, estrogen receptor alpha and retinoid x receptor alpha.

the plumed serpent,non_science,"the plumed serpent is a 1926 political novel by d. h. lawrence; lawrence conceived the idea for the novel while visiting mexico in 1923, and its themes reflect his experiences there. the novel was first published by martin secker's firm in the united kingdom and alfred a. knopf in the united states; an early draft was published as quetzalcoatl by black swan books in 1995. the novel's plot concerns kate leslie, an irish tourist who visits mexico after the mexican revolution. she encounters don cipriano, a mexican general who supports a religious movement, the men of quetzalcoatl, founded by his friend don ramón carrasco. within this movement, cipriano is identified with huitzilopochtli and ramón with quetzalcoatl. kate eventually agrees to marry cipriano, while the men of quetzalcoatl, with the help of a new president, bring about an end to christianity in mexico, replacing it with quetzalcoatl worship.
the novel received negative reviews. commentators have characterised it as fascist and an attack on christianity, and seen it as expressing lawrence's fears about the decline of the white race and belief in women's submission to men. it has also been interpreted as an expression of his personal political ambition and as having homoerotic aspects. critics have disagreed about its literary merit. some have found it inferior to his other work, but others have considered it his greatest accomplishment as a novelist, an assessment shared by lawrence himself. the novel received attention in mexico, where its early reception was positive, and it was praised by the poet octavio paz. however, this response was later displaced by mexican post-revolutionary nationalism and post-colonial studies. the plumed serpent has been compared to works of lawrence such as the novels kangaroo (1923) and lady chatterley's lover (1928) and the essays sketches of etruscan places and other italian essays (1932), as well as to the work of the poet t. s. eliot.


== plot ==
note: this description of the plot is based on the version of the book published as the plumed serpent, not the version published as quetzalcoatl.
shortly after easter, a group of tourists visiting mexico, including kate leslie, an irishwoman, and her cousin, owen rhys, an american, attend a bullfight in mexico city. leslie is thrilled at the prospect of witnessing the fight, but later leaves in disgust, after witnessing the violence suffered by a horse and a bull. as she leaves, she encounters don cipriano, a mexican general, and invites him to meet her. later, at a party in tlacolula which she attends with rhys, leslie listens to discussions of changes brought about by the mexican revolution, and encounters a major law, who states that there is a rumour that the recently elected mexican president, socrates tomás montes of the labour party, will be prevented from taking office by the military. she also meets cipriano's friend don ramón carrasco. soon afterwards, she reads a newspaper report, ""the gods of antiquity return to mexico"", describing an incident in the village of sayula, in which a man arose from a lake, then announced to a group of women that the aztec gods quetzalcoatl and tlaloc are ready to return to mexico. rhys returns to the united states, but leslie decides to stay in mexico. wanting to leave mexico city because of rising social tensions, she travels to sayula, with the encouragement of cipriano. she learns of a religious movement, the men of quetzalcoatl, and, upon making inquiries about it, is told that it was founded by ramón, who is suspected of having political ambitions. leslie begins to sympathise with ramón, believing him to be a ""great man"". receiving an invitation from ramón, she meets him and his wife doña carlota, who tells her that he wants to be worshipped as a god and to destroy the belief of mexicans in both jesus and the virgin mary, objectives she deplores.cipriano tells leslie that he wants to marry her and make her a goddess in a pantheon of deities alongside himself and ramón, explaining that this will help ramón. leslie at first rejects these proposals and considers leaving mexico. meanwhile, the unpopular actions of the new president provoke a rebellion, and the church moves against ramón, denouncing him as an ""anti-christ"". cipriano continues to support ramón, despite being obliged to defend the mexican government. ramón tries to remain politically neutral. cipriano arranges a meeting between ramón and a bishop. ramón tells cipriano that every people in the world needs its own ""saviour"", and that the ""teutonic world"" should return to the worship of thor and wotan, just as other nations should return to the worship of their ancient gods. when ramón and cipriano meet the bishop, ramón suggests to him that the catholic church should embrace all gods, including quetzalcoatl; the bishop rejects this. ramón tells the bishop that he intends to remove images from a church in sayula, burn them, and replace them with images of quetzalcoatl; the bishop warns him against this, but ramón remains firm in his plans, and tells the bishop to advise his superiors of them.ramón tries to encourage kate to marry cipriano, but she still has doubts. he tells her of the dissatisfying nature of his relationship with carlota, saying that the two of them never ""met in our souls"", and that her faith in jesus and his role in the men of quetzalcoatl now makes this impossible. he explains to kate that, for him, quetzalcoatl is a ""symbol of the best a man may be"". soon afterwards, a priest is attacked after preaching a sermon against ramón and quetzalcoatl, and later threatened with death. priests denounce the men of quetzalcoatl. the church in sayula is closed, and later entered by ramón and a group of his followers, who remove images of jesus, mary, and several saints. the images are taken away and burned. these events are followed by further incidents of violence and unrest. kate travels to jamiltepec, where she meets ramón and tells him that she approves of the removal of images from the church in sayula. he encourages her to support his movement. when an attempt is made to assassinate ramón, kate becomes involved in the conflict, and he afterwards credits her intervention with saving his life. one of ramón's followers tells kate that priests and the knights of cortés are to blame for the attack.kate meets ramón and cipriano. ramón tells her that just as he will be identified with quetzalcoatl, cipriano will be identified with huitzilopochtli. kate accepts cipriano as huitzilopochtli and they are married by ramón. afterwards, kate returns to sayula, where she learns that the church has been turned into a temple of quetzalcoatl. a religious meeting presided over by ramón and cipriano is interrupted by carlota, who calls on god to take ramón's life. carlota collapses and is taken to bed; she subsequently dies. worship of quetzalcoatl continues to spread through mexico; cipriano wants the president to declare it the official religion of mexico, but ramón disagrees, believing that it should be allowed to spread of its own accord. cipriano gives kate the name ""malintzi"". ramón later marries a young woman named teresa. kate tells first teresa, then cipriano, that she wants to leave mexico. later, an attempt is made to assassinate the president, and mexico is taken to the point of religious war. in mexico city, the men of quetzalcoatl turn a church into a quetzalcoatl temple; the archbishop of mexico is arrested before he and his followers can attempt to retake the building for the catholic church. eventually, the president has the catholic church made illegal and orders quetzalcoatl worship made the official religion of mexico; all churches are closed, and the archbishop is deported. kate and cipriano are legally married. ramón tells kate to tell the irish that they should follow their traditional gods and heroes. kate is left conflicted about whether to leave mexico or not.


== background and publication history ==

in march 1923, lawrence, accompanied by the poet witter bynner and willard johnson, visited mexico. there, according to the biographer brenda maddox, the ""sight of aztec ruins and the lush countryside outside mexico city"" gave him the idea for a book. lawrence began writing the plumed serpent in may 1923. maddox states that writing the novel was exhausting for lawrence, and that it ""nearly killed him"", owing to the illness he contracted upon finishing it, which he did not expect to survive. she notes that the character of owen rhys was based on bynner, and that the bullfight that occurs early in the plumed serpent was based on an actual bullfight lawrence attended with bynner and johnson. she maintains that the bullfight scene reflects the disturbing effect on lawrence of travelling with bynner and johnson, a homosexual couple.the plumed serpent was first published in 1926 by martin secker's firm in the united kingdom and alfred a. knopf in the united states. the novel has also been published by heinemann, penguin books, and vintage books. lawrence wanted to call the book ""quetzalcoatl"", after the aztec god of that name, but knopf insisted on ""the plumed serpent"", a title lawrence disliked. an early draft of the book, different enough to be considered a distinct work, was published as quetzalcoatl by black swan books in 1995.


== reception ==
critics have disagreed about the literary merit of the plumed serpent, some, including the novelist e. m. forster and the writer john middleton murry, praising it as lawrence's best work and others dismissing it. according to john b. vickery, while most critics admired ""lawrence's masterful descriptions, his evocation of place and his handling of individual scenes"", many also criticised his ""humorless obsession"" with saving mexico and the world. lawrence's biographer harry t. moore states that the plumed serpent received negative reviews from p. c. kennedy in the new statesman, the journalist katherine anne porter in the new york herald tribune, and the novelist l. p. hartley in the saturday review. he adds that additional negative reviews appeared in the times literary supplement, which described the novel as ""feeble"", and the spectator, which described it as ""verbose"". however, moore writes that it received a more mixed assessment, discussing both its good and bad aspects, from the poet edwin muir in the nation and athenaeum. moore himself maintained that the plumed serpent could be considered a ""magnificent failure"" and that it was ""a greater achievement than the smoother work of the lesser authors celebrated at that time."" he considered its first six chapters to be its best part, writing that they contain ""wonderful prose"". he also noted that the novel sold well.maddox writes that the novel received a negative review from charles marriott in the manchester guardian, who deplored its failure to produce convincing characterizations, a response similar to that of hartley in the saturday review. according to maddox, porter considered the novel inferior to lawrence's earlier work sons and lovers (1913), and believed that the difference in quality between the two works showed ""the catastrophe that has overtaken lawrence."" the plumed serpent received a mixed review from time, which described it as ""a strange, compelling state of affairs rather than a story"", and wrote that it reflected the ""physico-mysticism"", and preoccupation with sexual psychology, of its author. time wrote that lawrence's work ""moves many profoundly, puzzles others, and revolts the squeamish."" donald douglas wrote in the nation that the plumed serpent contains ""passages of miraculous wonder and words like arrows tipped with light borrowed from the sun"" and that ""lawrence has all his old infallible and inexhaustible knowledge of woman's nature and his indians bear all the fascination of an alien life perfectly understood.""later assessments of the plumed serpent include those of f. b. pinion, who considered it the most ambitious and successful of lawrence's novels written after women in love (1920). brett neilson compared the plumed serpent to women in love, arguing that they imagined ""the primitive"" in similar ways and that both involved the theme of an ""eternal conjunction between two men"". he compared ramón to rupert birkin, a character of women in love, maintaining that they had similar ""sexual philosophies"". the critics f. r. leavis and harold bloom have seen the plumed serpent as inferior to women in love, as well as to lawrence's the rainbow (1915). bloom compared the plumed serpent to the novelist norman mailer's ancient evenings (1983), suggesting that it had a similar underlying motive. he has argued that lawrence was writing as a political theorist in the plumed serpent, which he described as a ""fascist fiction"".the poet richard aldington described the plumed serpent as ""curious and original"". he compared it to frederick rolfe's novel hadrian the seventh (1904), arguing that ""in both books the author imagines himself raised to a position of power which he never had the faintest chance of attaining in fact on this earth."" he suggested that the novel shows lawrence's ""dissenting horror from the very things he is supposed to be preaching."" he interpreted cipriano and ramón as projections of d. h. lawrence. the writer anthony burgess maintained that the plumed serpent is the least liked of lawrence's novels due to its lack of humour and its exploration of a theme of little interest to readers ""with no knowledge of the ancient aztec gods and what they could mean to a revitalized or laurentianised mexico."" he called its ending unconvincing. leavis and burgess have compared the plumed serpent to kangaroo, burgess finding the similarity to be their shared emphasis on bloodshed. leavis maintained that unlike the rainbow and women in love, but like aaron's rod (1922) and kangaroo, the plumed serpent was ""exploratory and experimental."" though appreciating features such as its bullfight scene, he dismissed it as a bad book and the least complex of lawrence's novels, arguing that it suffered from his single-minded concern with imagining a ""revival of the ancient mexican religion."" critics have offered differing interpretations of kate leslie. aldington and burgess saw the character as a representation of frieda lawrence, but leavis maintained that leslie was not a representation of frieda lawrence. the critic frederick crews argued that the character was simply an opportunity for lawrence to present ""lawrentian doctrine.""the plumed serpent has been criticised by feminist authors such as the philosopher simone de beauvoir and the activist kate millett. de beauvoir compared lawrence's view of female sexuality to that of the physician gregorio marañón. she argued that the plumed serpent was the novel that most fully expressed lawrence's ideal of female behavior, according to which the ""woman must renounce personal love"" and abdicate all pride and will. millett described the novel as homoerotic. she considered its ""consecration scene"" an example of the ""symbolically surrogate"" scenes of  pederasty in lawrence's novels. she suggested that the novel was deservedly neglected, criticising lawrence's ""protofascist tone"", ""fondness of force"", ""arrogance"", and ""racial, class, and religious bigotries."" she maintained that the novel showed his search for triumph in politics and other areas of life, and that it records his invention of a religion of ""male supremacy"", with its prose celebrating ""phallic supremacy"". she described leslie as a ""female impersonator"".the english professor marianna torgovnick suggested that the novel ""advocates women’s slavelike submission to men and surrender of the drive toward orgasm"" and suffered from ""overblown prose"". she considered it, like lady chatterley's lover, vulnerable to millett's criticism. torgovnick saw the plumed serpent and lawrence's story ""the woman who rode away"" (1925) as sharing an interest in ""extremes of experience"", and found both similar to the work of writers such as bataille, and the dramatist antonin artaud, in their emphasis on human sacrifice. she wrote that the plumed serpent ""has been charged with protofascism"", adding that it ""states its racialised theses quite clearly at times. it posts lawrence's views, derived from theories circulating within his culture, of the fall and rise of races based upon energy and power. lawrence's fear is specifically the fear that the white race will be supplanted"". she characterised it as being, like aaron's rod, part of a phase of lawrence's career during which he was suspicious of and hostile towards women.l. d. clark described the plumed serpent as ""perplexing"". he suggested that the work was both open to misinterpretation, and ""a flagrant piece of propaganda"", intended by lawrence as a ""new gospel to mankind."" he believed that it suffered from faults such as ""careless language"", ""wearisome repetitions"", and the ""confusion of practical with artistic ends""; he considered its ""prophetic aspirations"" a fault as well. however, he considered the novel redeemed by, ""lawrence's profound sympathy with the land he was writing about, and his uncanny skill at synthesizing form and setting and symbol."" he argued that lawrence was influenced by blavatsky, and that his use of ""bone symbolism"" resembled blavatsky's in the secret doctrine (1888). he suggested that lawrence's interest in the symbol of the circle resulted in part from his reading of occult writers such as blavatsky. he concluded that the novel's symbolism endowed it with ""peculiar brilliance."" he noted that one scene, involving ramón and cipriano, had been interpreted as evidence of lawrence's ""latent homosexuality"", but rejected the interpretation.the cultural critic philip rieff described the work as ""a novel of pagan religiosity"". rieff stated that in his ""imaginative rehabilitation"" of aztec ritual, lawrence ""rightly understands sun dancing as an imitation — or a dramatic representation — performed in substantiation of the divine concern with the human being."" however, he saw the work as an embarrassment even to lawrence's admirers. the critic frank kermode wrote that in 1928 lawrence accepted bynner's criticism of the ""leadership mystique"" advocated in the novel.the philosopher michel foucault considered the plumed serpent an example of how the modern ""deployment of sexuality"" has encouraged ""the desire for sex—the desire to have it, to have access to it, to discover it, to liberate it, to articulate it in discourse, to formulate it in truth"".the writer henry miller maintained that lawrence showed ""great creativity"" in the plumed serpent, finding it apparent in the way lawrence dealt with ""the eternal duality in man's nature"" by deifying it in the form of quetzalcoatl. he compared its themes to those of lawrence's the man who died (1929), and praised the way in which lawrence employed ""the old myth of the dragon."" the novelist william s. burroughs was influenced by the plumed serpent.the mexican intellectual enrique krauze described the plumed serpent as ""the most fascist"" of lawrence's writings, citing its ""deification of violence and masculine power"".the critic william york tindall compared the plumed serpent to the poet samuel taylor coleridge's kubla khan, gustave flaubert's salammbô, and the paintings of paul gauguin. he called it a ""great novel"" and ""metaphor for a feeling about reality"". maddox compared the plumed serpent to kangaroo, describing both novels as successors to aaron's rod. she also compared it to lady chatterley's lover, which likewise features a man who ""condescendingly instructs a woman in how to be a woman."" she stated that frieda lawrence, like d. h. lawrence, considered it his greatest novel, and shared its message, which maddox summarized as being that, ""christianity was outmoded and destructive and that the white races must find new modes of leadership to prevent the dark races from dragging them into anarchy."" she observed that one scene featuring ramón appearing before a rally evoked the third reich to later readers and encouraged the view that lawrence was a fascist. she also stated that the work influenced rolf gardiner.the cultural critic william irwin thompson that the novel shows that lawrence misunderstood the religion of ancient mexico. the english professor louis l. martz stated that the plumed serpent resembles the bible in its ""combination of prose and poetry, its mingling of narrative and description with songs and hymns, lyrical sermons and eloquent authorial ruminations, along with its frequent use of occult symbols"". he found the work a success so long as it is ""read as a novel of prophecy"". however, he found the published version of the plumed serpent in some ways inferior to the early version titled ""quetzalcoatl"", noting that the early version gave leslie a more significant role.anne fernihough described the plumed serpent as ""stridently ideological"", while mark kinkead-weekes described it as more ""ideologically elaborated"" and assertive than its early version quetzalcoatl, adding that lawrence made a ""deliberate and intransigent"" attack on christianity. he wrote that most reactions to it were either strongly positive or strongly negative, and stated that lawrence later rejected ""both the political and the sexual ideology"" of the novel. helen sword compared the plumed serpent to lady chatterley's lover, describing them both as novels in which, ""lawrence uses a woman's voice and consciousness to convey the message that women should submit physically and emotionally to men"", while paul eggert described lawrence's attempt to portray a ""society renovated by a new religion"" as pretentious and strained, michael bell called the plumed serpent strident and desperate in its rhetoric and maintained that, like kangaroo, it showed sympathy for political authoritarianism, and chris baldick wrote that leavis's dismissal of the plumed serpent has been accepted by most subsequent critics, including the philosopher eliseo vivas and julian moynahan, and become part of a consensus.vickery considered it unfair to reduce the novel to a political plan, arguing that lawrence's central concern was that people were being led ""further and further away from the realization of their own essential nature"", and that lawrence's own views were different from those of ramón. he considered lawrence's approach to primitive myth and ritual in the plumed serpent consistent with that he later took in sketches of etruscan places and other italian essays, maintaining that lawrence used the character ramón to depict ""the attainment of an integrated personality"". he compared the novel to the poet t. s. eliot's poem the waste land (1922), observing that both works juxtaposed ""past and present"".donna przybylowicz maintained that the novel revealed a conflict between contradictory fascist and liberal humanist tendencies within lawrence's work. she compared lawrence to leavis and eliot, suggesting that like eliot, lawrence believed that ""all crises of a capitalistic post-war society of class-conflict could be transcended by ignoring history and replacing it with myth"", although with the difference that eliot's views were christian and lawrence's ""paganistic"". she argued that the plumed serpent, by depicting the proletariat and indian peasants as needing to be controlled by a dictatorial leader, revealed lawrence as ""basically anti-democratic and anti-socialist"", and that it also presented a ""western stereotyped notion"" of ""the dark races"" as ""lazy, dirty, resentful, covetous, irresponsible, and aimless"". she believed that lawrence ""correctly portrays the crisis of mexican society as resulting from reification and social fragmentation"", but criticised him for repudiating ""revolutionary political change"" and wanting to maintain class divisions.lydia blanchard described the novel as ""puzzling"", and wrote that it was ""infrequently admired even by lawrence admirers"", with most readers finding it flawed, due to its ""turgid"" language, ""wooden"" characters, and ""improbable"" plot. she observed that it had been seen as a ""prelude to fascism"". karen mcleod hewitt described the novel as ""unpleasant nonsense"", writing that most of it celebrated ""a disgust for people which is also pretentious."" however, she praised the ""brief passages"" in which leslie's reactions to the cruelties of mexico were ""dramatized with passion"" and showed respect for the character.david carroll maintained that compared to its early version quetzalcoatl, the novel's published version showed ""more intimate knowledge of mexican culture"" and explored ""the confrontation of white and red consciousness"" with greater complexity. jad smith wrote that the plumed serpent is often regarded as ""the height of lawrence’s interest in authoritarian politics"" and was a ""notorious instance of lawrence’s proto-fascist leanings"". however, he noted that lawrence subsequently wrote letters, including one to bynner, ""that appear to repudiate his leadership vision"". he argued that they did not represent a change in lawrence's views, and stressed that lawrence did not necessarily endorse fascist politics, despite the presence of ""proto-fascist ideologies"" in the novel and its racism. he also argued that it reflected ""lawrence’s familiarity with german thought and culture"".duane edwards described the novel as lawrence's ""most profound expression of what the human psyche is"", and suggested that it prepared the way for lawrence's later novel lady chatterley's lover. he maintained that it was disturbing because it ""makes readers aware of their primitive, pre-conscious self, which connects them with their most ancient ancestors"". he observed that the novel had received a more negative response than any other work by lawrence, finding it surprising that it had ""so many detractors."" he disputed the characterisation of the work as racist and fascist, maintaining that lawrence's views should not be confused with those of his characters cipriano and ramón. julianne newmark compared the novel to willa cather's the professor's house (1925), arguing that both were inspired by ""engagement with evocative american places—specifically the high deserts and rugged expanses of the american southwest"" and are concerned with ""the ways place constitutes new identities."" she questioned the charge that the plumed serpent is racist and that lawrence's views resembled those of ""white supremacists"". damien barlow wrote that ""a queer approach to reading lawrence's modernist fiction"" has been proposed.armando pereira maintained that the novel reflected lawrence's desire to ""live in a creative way and free of the oppressive rationality, anxiety of technique and obsession of progress that had swallowed europe up."" nora marisa león-real méndez argued that lawrence ""confers significant meaning to the landmarks, constructing a narrative space that is particular as well as linked to the mexico outside the text."" camelia raghinaru argued that there was a connection between lawrence's interest in the kabbalah, which may have developed from his reading, early in the 20th century, of the occultist, and founder of the theosophical society, helena blavatsky, and his development of a ""messianic utopia"" in the plumed serpent. she saw the novel as dealing with ""magical and mystical secrets whose purpose is to enact a messianic eschatology"" and believed that it revealed lawrence's preoccupation with ""femininity and its mystical significance."" she wrote that lawrence saw the plumed serpent as ""a magical incantation"" intended to ""change the world"". she interpreted the novel in terms of the philosopher julia kristeva's emphasis on abjection in powers of horror (1980), and maintained that it emphasised ""male sexuality and female submission"".luis gómez romero compared the novel to kangaroo, writing that in both works lawrence, ""exposes the advent of discrete crises resulting from the failure of human ideals and institutions to prevent and tame violence."" he noted that critics had often regarded the work as a ""direct expression of lawrence’s proto-fascist propensities."" he questioned the view that its plot had little to do with actual mexican politics, arguing that it should be viewed ""in a specifically mexican context."" he also observed that the early reception of the plumed serpent in mexico was positive, citing the views of the newspaper excélsior and the poet bernardo ortiz de montellano, who both credited lawrence with understanding mexico and the mexicans. he also noted the similar appreciative views of the intellectual antonio castro leal and the poet octavio paz. however, he stated that ""mexican post-revolutionary nationalism and the rise of post-colonial studies"" later displaced such positive views of the novel in mexico. he noted the poet josé juan tablada's accusation of plagiarism against lawrence, but discounted it, writing that the plumed serpent had little in common with tablada's la resurrección de los ídolos (1924). vladimiro rivas iturralde  maintained that lawrence wrote about ""the transformation of man in myth"" in an ""improbable way"" and that the plumed serpent was an ""artistic failure.""debra a. castillo compared the novel to the anthropologist tobias schneebaum's keep the river on your right (1969) and the work of the intellectual georges bataille. she maintained that it ""stands out among the hundreds of novels and stories written by anglo-americans and set in mexico for the particular forcefulness of lawrence's obsession with, and equally forceful rejection of, that country and its people."" she considered the work racist, and deemed it unsurprising that lawrence considered it his best novel, arguing that he did so because he found mexico, as a foreign society, an ideal subject on which to project his personal ""obsessions"". nevertheless, she believed that the novel contained valuable insights into the state of mexico after the mexican revolution. she noted that of those mexican writers who had discussed the novel, the poet josé emilio pacheco warned against its ""proto-fascism"", while paz praised its ""depiction of landscape"". david barnes noted that while lawrence regarded the novel as his most important, he made little reference to it after its publication, and that it is usually held that he later rejected its themes for new concerns in the late 1920s, expressed in works such as lady chatterley's lover. he criticised the novel's ""misogyny"", ""authoritarian politics"", and ""racial essentialism"", but nevertheless saw it as part of an important ""political debate about what forms of nationhood might emerge in the 1920s"" and showed awareness of ""the possibilities of nation as utopian community."" he maintained that while bynner's negative judgment of the novel, expressed in his memoir journeys with genius, had affected its reputation, lawrence was more interested in ""mexican revolutionary culture"" than bynner's comments suggested. he argued that the novel's themes were to some extent similar to those of lady chatterley's lover. he also compared the novel to kangaroo and sketches of etruscan places and other italian essays.shirley bricourt argued that episodes in the novel such as the bullfight scene depict rites that both ""act as catalysers of emotions"" and ""travesty these emotions as a submissive but passionate response."" she compared the novel to kangaroo. juliette feyel compared the plumed serpent to kangaroo, describing them as lawrence's ""most explicitly political novels"". she compared both work's to civilization and its discontents (1930), by sigmund freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, maintaining that lawrence and freud both ""correlate individual neurosis with civilization.""

'03 bonnie & clyde,non_science,"""'03 bonnie & clyde"" is a song recorded by american rapper jay-z featuring his then-girlfriend, american singer beyoncé knowles. it was composed by shawn carter, kanye west, prince nelson, tupac shakur, darryl harper, ricky rouse and tyrone wrice for jay-z's seventh studio album the blueprint 2: the gift & the curse (2002). the song was released as the album's lead single on october 10, 2002. a r&b song, ""'03 bonnie & clyde"" sampled its beat from american rapper tupac shakur's 1996 song ""me and my girlfriend"", paraphrasing its chorus, and was inspired by the crime film bonnie and clyde. the instrumentation is based on programmed drums, bass instruments, and a flamenco guitar.
""'03 bonnie & clyde"" was generally received with favorable reviews by music critics, who complimented the combination of jay-z's and beyoncé's musical styles, their collaboration and the song's production. the single reached number four on the billboard hot 100, becoming jay-z's second top ten single and beyoncé's first as a solo artist. it charted at number two in the united kingdom and peaked in the top twenty in other european territories. ""'03 bonnie & clyde"" was certified gold by the recording industry association of america (riaa) and platinum by the australian recording industry association (aria).
the accompanying music video was directed by chris robinson, and features jay-z and beyoncé playing a modern-day version of the 1920s bank robbers clyde barrow and bonnie parker. it was nominated for best hip-hop video at the 2003 mtv video music awards. ""'03 bonnie & clyde"" spawned a feud with american recording artist toni braxton, who had also sampled ""me and my girlfriend"" in her 2002 song ""me & my boyfriend"". she accused west and jay-z of stealing the idea of using the song as a sample, which was later denied by both of them. ""'03 bonnie & clyde"" was performed by jay-z and beyoncé on several television shows and was later included on the set list of their concert performances and tours, most notably on their co-headlining on the run and on the run ii tours.


== production and release ==
""'03 bonnie & clyde"" marked the first collaboration between rapper jay-z and r&b singer beyoncé knowles. while listening to shakur's the don killuminati: the 7 day theory, producer kanye west suggested that american rapper tupac shakur's song ""me and my girlfriend"" would make a good sample to use on jay-z's duet with knowles. west told mtv news that jay-z had asked him on the telephone for a duet for him and knowles: ""we got this joint, it has to be the best beat you ever made."" he continued:

so i went home and called my dog, e base, who plays a lot of instruments up at baseline [studio] for me and [producer] just blaze. [e] came through. i programmed the drums in 10 minutes, and then he played all the different parts. this version is all live bass, live guitars, [live] chords on it. i brought it to hov that night, he heard it, he thought of the video treatment before he thought of the rap. he just knew it was gonna be the one.

tensions arose during the conception of ""'03 bonnie & clyde"" over the sampling of ""me and my girlfriend"". senior vice president of a&r tina davis commented on the issue, ""we only had one day to clear the [tupac shakur] sample [from 'me and my girlfriend'] that was used on ''03 bonnie and clyde' last year with jay-z and knowles [beyoncé]. we were back and forth with afeni shakur all day until we got the clearance. and then it's a hit.""""'03 bonnie & clyde"" was released on october 10, 2002, as the lead single from jay-z's album the blueprint²: the gift & the curse. knowles later included the song as a bonus track on international editions of her 2003 debut solo album dangerously in love. in 2003, now that's what i call music! included ""'03 bonnie & clyde"" as the opening track of the 12th volume of the us release and the fifteenth track of the 54th volume of the uk release. the song's release was the first indication of jay-z's and knowles’ romantic status, spawning rumors about a burgeoning relationship. their relationship was not made public until jay-z featured on knowles’ songs ""crazy in love"" (2003) and ""déjà vu"" (2006). the latter's release also marked the debut of the solo career of knowles, leaving destiny's child on hiatus.

""'03 bonnie & clyde"" features drums and live instrumentation such as bass instruments and guitar chords. it also consists of a beat sampled from ""me and my girlfriend"". the song was inspired by the 1967 american crime film bonnie and clyde as jay-z and beyoncé proclaim themselves as the current version of the criminal duo. ethan brown of new york magazine noted that its patina of flamenco guitar was reminiscent of that in jay-z's 2001 collaboration with r. kelly on ""fiesta."" beyoncé mimics the hook of ""me and my girlfriend"" on the chorus as she sings, ""down to ride to the very end, me and my boyfriend"".some lyrics sung by beyoncé were sampled from ""if i was your girlfriend"" by american recording artist prince. on the second verse, jay-z references the relationship between bobby brown and whitney houston, and the american television comedy-drama series sex and the city as he raps: ""she riiides wit' me / the new bobby and whitney / only time we don't speak is during 'sex and the city' / put us together, how they gon' stop both of us? / when i'm off track, mommy is keeping us focused"". the verse then continues: ""let's lock this down like it's supposed to be/ the new '03 bonnie and clyde, hov and b"".


== critical reception ==
""'03 bonnie & clyde"" was received favorably by critics, who commended the use of different samples, and commented on the relationship between jay-z and beyoncé. chris ryan of spin magazine described ""'03 bonnie & clyde"" as a highlight on the blueprint 2: the gift & the curse, stating that it consists of ""a house party in a crib as big as the georgia dome."" john bush from allmusic included the song as a highlight on the album, further describing it as ""a slick r&b crossover with beyoncé knowles"". marc l. hill of popmatters viewed it as the ""obligatory radio song"" of the album. awarding the song a rating of eight out of ten possible points, dele fadele of nme complimented it as ""a cool duet"" between jay-z and beyoncé. john robinson of the same publication wrote that as the couple describe their life, it's not all ""lexus and sipping cris"". he added, ""a similarly relaxed production makes for a behind-the-diamante-net-curtains classic"".ethan brown of new york magazine named ""'03 bonnie & clyde"" as a follow-up to the previous ""bonnie & clyde part ii"" by jay-z featuring rapper foxy brown. erik parker, music editor of vibe magazine, was divided on the song's sample, writing that it was ""tasteless but well-executed"", and complimented west's production as ""impeccable"". margena a. christian of jet magazine praised jay-z's and beyoncé's collaboration, favoring the former's ""dropping lyrics"" and the latter's ""cooing silky vocals"". chuck taylor of billboard magazine wrote that though it was unclear at the time whether the couple were together or not, but they created good music together. taylor praised the song's ability to showcase what each artist does best: jay-z ""spitting"" verses of praise, and beyoncé's sweets coos and hooks. taylor noted that the sampled acoustic guitar ""added spice to the track, setting it up for future success"". in a more negative review, nathan rabin of the a.v. club described the song as ""terrible"" and different from the other songs on the blueprint 2: the gift & the curse.rap-up credited ""'03 bonnie & clyde"" for giving beyoncé a ""little street-credit"". the staff members of vibe magazine placed the song at number two on a list of the best bonnie and clyde inspired songs. on a list of the 10 best jay-z songs, dean silfenv of aol placed ""'03 bonnie & clyde"" at number six. popjustice listed ""'03 bonnie & clyde"" at number 66 on its list of the best singles of 2003. it was nominated for the best collaboration at the 2003 bet awards, but lost to snoop dogg's song ""beautiful"". in a 2013 list of jay-z's 20 biggest billboard hits, ""'03 bonnie & clyde"" was ranked at number 6. elijah watson and erika ramirez of billboard magazine noted that the song proved the couple was ""unstoppable from jump"".


== chart performance ==
""'03 bonnie & clyde"" reached the top ten on music charts in six european countries. it peaked at number six on the norway singles chart and on the danish singles chart, number eight on the italian singles chart, and topped the swiss singles charts. in canada, the song peaked at number four and became jay-z's highest charting single until it was surpassed by his 2009 alicia keys-assisted song ""empire state of mind"", which peaked at number three. in the united kingdom, ""'03 bonnie & clyde"" peaked at number two on the uk singles chart. at the time, it became his highest charting single in britain since ""hard knock life (ghetto anthem)"" achieved the same feat in november 1998. it peaked at number four on the new zealand singles chart, becoming his highest charting single in that territory. the song also became jay-z's highest charting single in australia, where it peaked at number two. ""'03 bonnie & clyde"" was certified platinum by the australian recording industry association (aria), denoting shipment of 70,000 copies.""'03 bonnie & clyde"" broke into the top five of the billboard hot 100 at number four; it became the highest-charting single that references the famous bank robbers bonnie and clyde. the record was previously held by georgie fame's 1986 single ""the ballad of bonnie and clyde."" following the performance of ""'03 bonnie & clyde"" on saturday night live (snl) on november 2, 2002, its radio audience increased by 12%, allowing the song to advance into the top ten of the us hot r&b/hip-hop songs chart, at number seven. this gave jay-z his 12th top 10 single, tying him with rapper p. diddy, who had the same number of top 10 singles on that chart. ""'03 bonnie & clyde"" was his first top 10 since his 2001 single ""girls, girls, girls"". it was certified gold by the recording industry association of america (riaa), denoting sales of 500,000 copies.the song sold over 1 million copies in us.


== music video ==
chris robinson directed the song's accompanying music video and filmed in mexico, during october 2002. june ambrose was hired as the personal stylist, and johnathon schaech and lance reddick appear in the video as the police officers on their tail. jay-z and beyoncé play a modern-day version of the 1930s bank robbers clyde barrow and bonnie parker. the video is loosely based on the american 1993 romance crime film true romance, which stars christian slater and patricia arquette as two lovers on the run from cocaine dealers. the choreography used in the clip suggests a relationship beyond screen, as jay-z wraps his arm around beyoncé while singing his part of the chorus. the video also marked a departure for the ""clean-cut beyoncé"" and created a symbiotic relationship between her and jay-z, allowing them to exchange audiences. the video was premiered on mtv on november 8, 2002.

the music video begins as police officers and reddick discuss the criminal duo and ways to catch them. as the song begins, jay-z is seen driving a gunmetal grey aston martin while beyoncé sits in the passenger seat. as they drive through the sepia sands of mexico, clips of the police from the beginning of the video are cut into the scene. as jay-z and beyoncé pull over to a hotel, they cover the car to avoid notice from the police. as beyoncé and jay-z count money in the bedroom, the police discover their hiding place and go upstairs only to find that the two have fled the scene in their car. scenes of beyoncé and jay-z at a mexican bar are inter-cut with scenes of an intimate time in a phone-booth; behind the phone booth, spray-painted onto a wall is a tribute to tupac shakur. the duo again elude the police who are following one step behind. after beyoncé performs her verse in an empty pool, the police form a blockade on the highway in an attempt to catch her and jay-z, only to be stumped again as two gas station attendant decoys are found driving the car. the video ends as beyoncé and jay-z light a bonfire on the beach and drive away in a different car.
corey moss of mtv news noted that the end of the video does not reveal how the ""real"" bonnie and clyde met their end. the story continues in the 2004 video for jay-z's song ""99 problems"". the music video for ""'03 bonnie & clyde"" was nominated for best hip-hop video at the 2003 mtv video music awards. in the official top 20 countdown of jay-z music videos, mtv uk listed the clip at number 10.


== controversy ==

on october 8, 2002, toni braxton and her team released a statement claiming that jay-z's song ""'03 bonnie & clyde"" had stolen braxton's idea to sample the 1996 tupac shakur song ""me and my girlfriend"". braxton sampled shakur's song on the track ""me & my boyfriend"", included on braxton's album, more than a woman (2002). in a call to a new york radio station, hosted by wendy williams, braxton stated that ""jay-z and beyoncé are messing with my money. they're trying to steal my mojo"". braxton said her song was recorded over the summer of 2002, and alleged that jay-z only decided to do ""'03 bonnie & clyde"" after she played her version of the song for def jam recordings.kanye west responded to braxton's claim in an interview for mtv news, ""i had no idea about toni braxton's [song]. she can't act like ain't nobody ever heard 'me and my girlfriend' before. people hear the song all the time. i can [understand her complaint] if it [was] an original song."" west defended the song's sample, stating that the idea came to him after listening to a friend's makaveli album one night. roc-a-fella records' co-ceo damon dash responded to braxton's claims:

jay is a talented dude. i don't think he would steal anything intentionally. it's an ill coincidence, and things happen for a reason. we'll see what happens behind it... i read it in the paper, and jay and i were talking about it this morning and it was a little funny. i know he didn't intentionally make the same record she made. i don't think he even heard it. [my] reaction is, 'sorry, it wasn't intentional.' jay makes records and puts them out. this [sh--] is music. it's just music. we don't sit around and have a blueprint to [f---] anybody's life up. the music business has been good to us. i'm not getting into any beef or nothing over music.
speaking for mtv news, jay-z responded to braxton's claims: ""i wouldn't want to take it from her. i don't even think like that. my first thought would be, 'maybe i could call her up, maybe i could get on that record.' the most obvious [explanation] is it's neither one of our records. it's not like you made an original idea. she's not in hip-hop, but it happens in hip-hop often. we go to sample the same thing and my record came out first. i'm sorry. what can i do?"" he went on saying that if he had known they were both planning to sample the same tupac song, he would have arranged a duet with her.


== live performances ==
on november 2, 2002, jay-z and beyoncé performed the song together at saturday night live (snl). later, on november 21, 2002 they appeared on mtv's trl for spankin' new music week where they also performed the song. in 2009, beyoncé performed an abbreviated version of ""'03 bonnie & clyde"" during her i am... yours revue, held at the encore las vegas theatre in july and august. the song was later included on the 2009 live album i am... yours: an intimate performance at wynn las vegas which was chronicling the revue. in august 2011, beyoncé performed ""'03 bonnie & clyde"" again during her revue 4 intimate nights with beyoncé and included the song on the dvd live at roseland: elements of 4 released in november 2011. during the concerts, beyoncé announced the song by saying, ""it's 2002... i started to feel a little lonely till one day..."". ""'03 bonnie & clyde"" was included on jay-z's live album live in brooklyn released on october 11, 2012 after he performed the song during eight shows in brooklyn. in 2013, jay-z included the song on the set list of his legends of the summer stadium tour.""'03 bonnie & clyde"" was part of the set list of beyoncé and jay-z's co-headlining on the run tour (2014) where the shows were opened with the performance of the song. a black-and-white video was shown on the screen accompanied by sirens as the duo appeared onstage surrounded by smoke. they started performing the song with beyoncé wearing a see-through fishnet mask and jay-z wearing black sunglasses, a star-speckled shirt, black jacket and gold chains. the song was in line with the show's overall criminalistic theme. d /54

halo-gibberellin,reagent,"citrus canker is a disease affecting citrus species caused by the bacterium xanthomonas axonopodis.  infection causes lesions on the leaves, stems, and fruit of citrus trees, including lime, oranges, and grapefruit.  while not harmful to humans, canker significantly affects the vitality of citrus trees, causing leaves and fruit to drop prematurely; a fruit infected with canker is safe to eat, but too unsightly to be sold.
the disease, which is believed to have originated in southeast asia, is extremely persistent when it becomes established in an area.  citrus groves have been destroyed in attempts to eradicate the disease. brazil and the united states are currently suffering from canker outbreaks.


== biology ==

xanthomonas axonopodis is a rod-shaped gram-negative bacterium with polar flagella. the bacterium has a genome length around 5 megabase pairs. a number of types of citrus canker diseases are caused by different pathovars and variants of the bacterium:
the asiatic type of canker (canker a), x. axonopodis pv. citri, caused by a group of strains originally found in asia, is the most widespread and severe form of the disease.
cancrosis b, caused by a group of x. axonopodis pv. aurantifolii strains originally found in south america is a disease of lemons, key lime, bitter orange, and pomelo.
cancrosis c, also caused by strains within x. axonopodis pv. aurantifolii, only infects key lime and bitter orange.
a* strains, discovered in oman, saudi arabia, iran, and india, only infect key lime.


== pathology ==
plants infected with citrus canker have characteristic lesions on leaves, stems, and fruit with raised, brown, water-soaked margins, usually with a yellow halo or ring effect around the lesion. older lesions have a corky appearance, still in many cases retaining the halo effect. the bacterium propagates in lesions in leaves, stems, and fruit. the lesions ooze bacterial cells that, when dispersed by windblown rain, can spread to other plants in the area. infection may spread further by hurricanes. the disease can also be spread by contaminated equipment, and by transport of infected or apparently healthy plants. due to latency of the disease, a plant may appear to be healthy, but actually be infected.
citrus canker bacteria can enter through a plant's stomata or through wounds on leaves or other green parts. in most cases, younger leaves are considered to be the most susceptible. also, damage caused by citrus leaf miner larvae (phyllocnistis citrella) can be sites for infection to occur. within a controlled laboratory setting, symptoms can appear in 14 days following inoculation into a susceptible host. in the field environment, the time for symptoms to appear and be clearly discernible from other foliar diseases varies; it may be on the order of several months after infection. lower temperatures increase the latency of the disease. citrus canker bacteria can stay viable in old lesions and other plant surfaces for several months.


== pathogenicity ==
xanthomonas axonopodis has the capability to form a biofilm for attachment on the host. the biofilm is the result of the production of extracellular polysaccharides (xanthan). the biofilm ensures the virulence and epiphytic survival of x. axonopodis pv. citri prior to the development of citrus canker. in addition, the bacteria secrete transcriptional activator-like (tal) effectors through the type iii secretion system. the effector interacts with host machinery to induce transcription for genes that regulate plant hormones such as gibberellin and auxin.


== disease cycle ==
xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri overseason in an infected area which appears as a canker lesion on leaf or stem. the bacteria ooze out of the lesions when there is free moisture. during rainy weather, wind-blown rain carries the inoculum to new susceptible hosts. the bacteria infect new plants through stomata and wounds. pruning or hedging can cut open mesophyll tissues, creating wounds through which the plant may be directly infected. the rain can also cause water congestion on the leaf surface, form columns of water through the stomata and promote infection through natural openings. infections can form on fruit, foliage and young stem. leaves and stems are most susceptible to infection within the first six weeks of initial growth. infection of fruit is most likely to occur during the 90 day period after petal fall during fruit formation. the varied size of lesions on citrus fruit is because of the multiple cycle of infections and can reflect different-aged lesions on the same fruit.


=== favorable environmental conditions ===
wind-driven rain plays a major role in the dispersal of x. axonopodis. the bacteria are said to be readily dispersed by splashed rain and wind and the quantity of x. axonopodis declines after the first event of wind-blown rain dispersal. apart from that, the bacteria also favor warm weather. the cases of citrus canker are more acute in areas that receive high rainfall and have high mean temperature, such as florida. often, cankers emerge briskly during fall, slowly during winter and most rapidly in mid to late spring.


=== detection ===
the disease can be detected in groves and on fruit by the appearance of lesions. early detection is critical in quarantine situations. bacteria can be tested for pathogenicity by inoculating multiple citrus species with them. additional diagnostic tests (antibody detection), fatty-acid profiling, and genetic procedures using polymerase chain reaction can be conducted to confirm diagnosis and may help to identify the particular canker strain. clara h. hasse determined that citrus canker was not of fungoid origin but was caused by a bacterial parasite.  her research published in the 1915 journal of agricultural research played a major part in saving citrus crops in multiple states.


=== susceptibility ===
not all species and varieties of citrus have been tested for citrus canker. most of the common species and varieties of citrus are susceptible to it. some species are more susceptible than others, while a few species are resistant to infection.


== management ==
quarantine measures are implemented in areas where citrus canker is not endemic or has been obliterated to prevent the introduction of x. axonopodis. on the other hand, in regions where citrus canker occurs, integrated pest management (ipm) is utilized. the most notable feature of this management program is the transposition of susceptible citrus plants to field resistant citrus cultivars. apart from using resistant cultivars in fields, there are several measures that are taken to control citrus canker from causing failed crop. the measures can be divided into three major categories: exclusion, eradication and sanitation.


=== exclusion ===
citrus trees or fruits from outside of the country are inspected to ensure they are bacteria-free trees. under the management program, the production of xac (x. axonopodis pv. citri)-free nursery trees for exclusion of canker from orchard is also mandatory. because the bacteria can be introduced from countries with endemic canker or canker outbreaks, strict restrictions on citrus importation are implemented in citrus-growing countries. citrus trees will only be grown on canker-free fields at least one year after effective eradication. planting sites are also chosen to minimize favorable environmental conditions for the spread of x. axonopodis. for example, areas with strong wind are avoided to decrease the dispersal of bacterial inoculum to the susceptible citrus trees.


=== eradication ===
once citrus canker is introduced into a field, removal of the infected trees is enacted to halt further spread of the bacteria. for instance, in florida between 2000 and 2006, all citrus trees within 1,900 feet (580 m) of infected trees were required to be eradicated. in the process, the infected trees are uprooted and burned. in urban areas, the trees are cut down and chipped, then disposed of in landfills.


=== sanitation ===
x. axonopodis pv. citri can be transmitted by mechanical means such as humans and machinery. as a sanitation measure, the workers in citrus orchards are required to do thorough decontamination of personnel and equipment to prevent the spread of bacteria from the infected areas. aerosol inoculum is able to cause infection in wetted foliage in the zone of bacterial dispersal. vehicles can also become contaminated by contacting the wet foliage. contaminated equipment and machines can be disinfected by spraying bactericide.


== distribution and economic impact ==
citrus canker is thought to have originated in the area of southeast asia-india. it is now also present in japan, south and central africa, the middle east, bangladesh, the pacific islands, some countries in south america, and florida. some areas of the world have eradicated citrus canker and others have ongoing eradication programs, but the disease remains endemic in most areas where it has appeared. because of its rapid spread, high potential for damage, and impact on export sales and domestic trade, citrus canker is a significant threat to all citrus-growing regions.


=== australia ===
the citrus industry is the largest fresh-fruit exporting industry in australia. australia has had three outbreaks of citrus canker, all of which have been successfully eradicated. the disease was found twice during the 1900s in the northern territory and was eradicated each time. in 2004, an unexplained outbreak occurred in central queensland. the state and federal governments ordered all commercial groves, all noncommercial citrus trees, and all native lime trees (c. glauca) in the vicinity of emerald to be destroyed rather than trying to isolate infected trees. eradication was successful, with permission to replant being granted to farmers by the biosecurity unit of the queensland department of primary industries in early 2009.
citrus canker was detected again in april 2018 and confirmed in may 2018 in the northern territory and western australia.


=== brazil ===
citrus is an important domestic and export crop for brazil. citrus agriculture is the second-most important agricultural activity in the state of são paulo, the largest sweet orange production area in the world. over 100,000 groves are in são paulo, and the area planted with citrus is increasing. of the estimated 2 million trees, greater than 80% are a single variety of orange, and the remainder is made up of tangerine and lemon trees. because of the uniformity in citrus variety, the state has been adversely affected by canker, causing crop and monetary losses. in brazil, rather than destroying entire groves to eradicate the disease, contaminated trees and trees within a 30-m radius are destroyed; by 1998, over half a million trees had been destroyed.


=== united states ===
citrus canker was first found in the united states in 1910 not far from the georgia – florida border. subsequently, canker was discovered in 1912 in dade county, more than 400 mi (600 km) away. beyond florida, the disease was discovered in the gulf states and reached as far north as south carolina. it took more than 20 years to eradicate that outbreak of citrus canker, from 1913 through 1931, $2.5 million in state and private funds were spent to control it—a sum equivalent to $28 million in 2000 dollars. in 26 counties, some 257,745 grove trees and 3,093,110 nursery trees were destroyed by burning. citrus canker was detected again on the gulf coast of florida in 1986 and declared eradicated in 1994.
the most recent outbreak of citrus canker was discovered in miami-dade county, florida, on september 28, 1995, by louis willio francillon, a florida department of agriculture agronomist.  despite eradication attempts, by late 2005, the disease had been detected in many places distant from the original discovery, for example, in orange park, 315 miles (500 km) away. in january 2000, the florida department of agriculture adopted a policy of removing all infected trees and all citrus trees within a 1900-ft radius of an infected tree in both residential areas and commercial groves. previous to this eradication policy, the department eradicated all citrus trees within 125 ft of an infected one. the program ended in january 2006 following a statement from the usda that eradication was not feasible.

t cell receptor alpha variable 1-2 (human),protein,"the t-cell receptor (tcr) is a protein complex found on the surface of t cells, or t lymphocytes, that is responsible for recognizing fragments of antigen as peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex (mhc) molecules. the binding between tcr and antigen peptides is of relatively low affinity and is degenerate: that is, many tcrs recognize the same antigen peptide and many antigen peptides are recognized by the same tcr.the tcr is composed of two different protein chains (that is, it is a hetero dimer). in humans, in 95% of t cells the tcr consists of an alpha (α) chain and a beta (β) chain (encoded by tra and trb, respectively), whereas in 5% of t cells the tcr consists of gamma and delta (γ/δ) chains (encoded by trg and trd, respectively). this ratio changes during ontogeny and in diseased states (such as leukemia). it also differs between species. orthologues of the 4 loci have been mapped in various species. each locus can produce a variety of polypeptides with constant and variable regions.when the tcr engages with antigenic peptide and mhc (peptide/mhc), the t lymphocyte is activated through signal transduction, that is, a series of biochemical events mediated by associated enzymes, co-receptors, specialized adaptor molecules, and activated or released transcription factors. based on the initial receptor triggering mechanism, the tcr belongs to the family of non-catalytic tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors (ntrs).


== history ==
in 1982, nobel laureate james p. allison first discovered the t-cell receptor. then, tak wah mak and mark m. davis identified the cdna clones encoding the human and mouse tcr respectively in 1984. these findings allowed the entity and structure of the elusive tcr, known before as the ""holy grail of immunology"", to be revealed. this allowed scientists from around the world to carry out studies on the tcr, leading to important studies in the fields of car-t, cancer immunotherapy and checkpoint inhibition.


== structural characteristics ==
the tcr is a disulfide-linked membrane-anchored heterodimeric protein normally consisting of the highly variable alpha (α) and beta (β) chains expressed as part of a complex with the invariant cd3 chain molecules. t cells expressing this receptor are referred to as α:β (or αβ) t cells, though a minority of t cells express an alternate receptor, formed by variable gamma (γ) and delta (δ) chains, referred as γδ t cells.each chain is composed of two extracellular domains: variable (v) region and a constant (c) region, both of immunoglobulin superfamily (igsf) domain forming antiparallel β-sheets. the constant region is proximal to the cell membrane, followed by a transmembrane region and a short cytoplasmic tail, while the variable region binds to the peptide/mhc complex.
the variable domain of both the tcr α-chain and β-chain each have three hypervariable or complementarity-determining regions (cdrs). there is also an additional area of hypervariability on the β-chain (hv4) that does not normally contact antigen and, therefore, is not considered a cdr.
the residues in these variable domains are located in two regions of the tcr, at the interface of the α- and β-chains and in the β-chain framework region that is thought to be in proximity to the cd3 signal-transduction complex. cdr3 is the main cdr responsible for recognizing processed antigen, although cdr1 of the alpha chain has also been shown to interact with the n-terminal part of the antigenic peptide, whereas cdr1 of the β-chain interacts with the c-terminal part of the peptide.
cdr2 is thought to recognize the mhc. cdr4 of the β-chain is not thought to participate in antigen recognition, but has been shown to interact with superantigens.
the constant domain of the tcr consists of short connecting sequences in which a cysteine residue forms disulfide bonds, which form a link between the two chains.
the tcr is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, a large group of proteins involved in binding, recognition, and adhesion; the family is named after antibodies (also called immunoglobulins). the tcr is similar to a half-antibody consisting of a single heavy and single light chain, except the heavy chain is without its crystallisable fraction (fc). the two subunits of tcr are twisted together. whereas the antibody uses its fc region to bind to fc receptors on leukocytes, tcr is already docked onto the cell membrane. however, it is not able to mediate signal transduction itself due to its short cytoplasmic tail, so tcr still requires cd3 and zeta to carry out the signal transduction in its place, just as antibodies require binding to fcrs to initiate signal transduction. in this way the mhc-tcr-cd3 interaction for t cells is functionally similar to the antigen(ag)-immunoglobulin(ig)-fcr interaction for myeloid leukocytes, and ag-ig-cd79 interaction for b cells.

the generation of tcr diversity is similar to that for antibodies and b-cell antigen receptors. it arises mainly from genetic recombination of the dna-encoded segments in individual somatic t cells by somatic v(d)j recombination using rag1 and rag2 recombinases. unlike immunoglobulins, however, tcr genes do not undergo somatic hypermutation, and t cells do not express activation-induced cytidine deaminase(aid). the recombination process that creates diversity in bcr (antibodies) and tcr is unique to lymphocytes (t and b cells) during the early stages of their development in primary lymphoid organs (thymus for t cells, bone marrow for b cells).
each recombined tcr possess unique antigen specificity, determined by the structure of the antigen-binding site formed by the α and β chains in case of αβ t cells or γ and δ chains on case of γδ t cells.
the tcr alpha chain is generated by vj recombination, whereas the beta chain is generated by vdj recombination (both involving a random joining of gene segments to generate the complete tcr chain).
likewise, generation of the tcr gamma chain involves vj recombination, whereas generation of the tcr delta chain occurs by vdj recombination.the intersection of these specific regions (v and j for the alpha or gamma chain; v, d, and j for the beta or delta chain) corresponds to the cdr3 region that is important for peptide/mhc recognition (see above).
it is the unique combination of the segments at this region, along with palindromic and random nucleotide additions (respectively termed  ""p-"" and ""n-""), which accounts for the even greater diversity of t-cell receptor specificity for processed antigenic peptides.
later during development, individual cdr loops of tcr can be re-edited in the periphery outside thymus by reactivation of recombinases using a process termed tcr revision (editing) and change its antigenic specificity.


== the tcr complex ==
in the plasma membrane the tcr receptor chains α and β associate with six additional adaptor proteins to form an octameric complex. the complex contains both α and β chains, forming the ligand-binding site, and the signaling modules cd3δ, cd3γ, cd3ε and cd3ζ in the stoichiometry tcr α β - cd3εγ - cd3εδ - cd3ζζ. charged residues in the transmembrane domain of each subunit form polar interactions allowing a correct and stable assembly of the complex. the cytoplasmic tail of the tcr is extremely short, hence the cd3 adaptor proteins contain the signalling motifs needed for propagating the signal from the triggered tcr into the cell.
the signalling motifs involved in tcr signalling are tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail of these adaptor proteins that can be phosphorylated in the event of tcr-pmhc binding. the tyrosine residues reside in a specific amino acid sequence of the signature yxx(l/i)x6-8yxx(l/i), where y, l, i indicate tyrosine, leucine and isoleucine residues, x denotes any amino acids, the subscript 6-8 indicates a sequence of 6 to 8 amino acids in length. this motif is very common in activator receptors of the non-catalytic tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor (ntr) family and is referred to as immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (itam). cd3δ, cd3γ and cd3ε each contain a single itam, while cd3ζ contains three itams. in total the tcr complex contains 10 itams. phosphorylated itams act as binding site for sh2-domains of additionally recruited proteins.


== antigen discrimination ==

each t cell expresses clonal tcrs which recognize a specific peptide loaded on a mhc molecule (pmhc), either on mhc class ii on the surface of antigen-presenting cells or mhc class i on any other cell type. 
a unique feature of t cells is their ability to discriminate between peptides derived from healthy, endogenous cells and peptides from foreign or abnormal (e.g. infected or cancerous) cells in the body. antigen presenting cells do not discriminate between self and foreign peptides and typically express a large number of self derived pmhc on their cell surface and only a few copies of any foreign pmhc. for example, it has been shown that cells infected with hiv have only 8-46 hiv specific pmhcs next to 100000 total pmhc per cell.because t cells undergo positive selection in the thymus there is a non-negligible affinity between self pmhc and the tcr, nevertheless, the t-cell receptor signalling should not be activated by self pmhc such that endogenous, healthy cells are ignored by t cells. 
however, when these very same cells contain even minute quantities of pathogen derived pmhc, t cells must get activated and initiate immune responses. the ability of t cells to ignore healthy cells but respond when these same cells express a small number of foreign pmhc is known as antigen discrimination.to do so, t cells have a very high degree of antigen specificity, despite of fact that the affinity to the peptide/mhc ligand is rather low in comparison to other receptor types. the affinity, given as the dissociation constant (kd), between a tcr and a pmhc was determined by surface plasmon resonance (spr) to be in the range of 1-100 μm, with an association rate (kon) of 1000 -10000 m−1 s−1 and a dissociation rate (koff) of 0.01 -0.1 s−1. in comparison, cytokines have an affinity of kd = 10-600 pm to their receptor. 
it has been shown that even a single amino acid change in the presented peptide that affects the affinity of the pmhc to the tcr reduces the t cell response and cannot be compensated by a higher pmhc concentration. a negative correlation between the dissociation rate of the pmhc-tcr complex and the strength of the t cell response has been observed. that means, pmhc that bind the tcr for a longer time initiate a stronger activation of the t cell. 
furthermore, t cells are very sensitive. interaction with a single pmhc is enough to trigger activation. also, the decision whether a t cell response to an antigen is made fast. t cells rapidly scan pmhc on an antigen presenting cell to increase the change of finding a specific pmhc. on average, t cell encounter 20 apcs per hour.different models for the molecular mechanisms that underlie this highly specific and highly sensitive process of antigen discrimination have been proposed. the occupational model simply suggests that the tcr response is proportional to the number of pmhc bound to the receptor. given this model, a shorter lifetime of a peptide can be compensated by higher concentration such that the maximum response of the t cell stays the same. however, this cannot be seen in experiments and the model has been widely rejected.
the most accepted view is that the tcr engages in kinetic proofreading. 
the kinetic proofreading model proposes that a signal is not directly produced upon binding but a series of intermediate steps insure a time delay between binding and signal output. such intermediate  ""proofreading"" steps can be multiple rounds of tyrosine phosphorylation. these steps require energy and therefore do not happen spontaneously, only when the receptor is bound to its ligand. this way only ligands with high affinity that bind the tcr for a long enough time can initiate a signal. all intermediate steps are reversible, such that upon ligand dissociation the receptor reverts to its original unphosphorylated state before a new ligand binds.
this model predicts that maximum response of t cells decreases for pmhc with shorter lifetime. experiments have confirmed this model.
however, the basic kinetic proofreading model has a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. increasing the number of proofreading steps increases the specificity but lowers the sensitivity of the receptor. the model is therefore not sufficient to explain the high sensitivity and specificity of tcrs that have been observed. (altan bonnet2005) multiple models that extend the kinetic proofreading model have been proposed, but evidence for the models is still controversial.the antigen sensitivity is higher in antigen-experienced t cells than in naive t cells. naive t cells pass through the process of functional avidity maturation with no change in affinity. it is based on the fact that effector and memory (antigen-experienced) t cell are less dependent on costimulatory signals and higher antigen concentration than naive t cell.


== signaling pathway ==
the essential function of the tcr complex is to identify specific bound antigen derived from a potentially harmful pathogen and elicit a distinct and critical response. at the same time it has to ignore any self-antigen and tolerate harmless antigens such as food antigens. the signal transduction mechanism by which a t cell elicits this response upon contact with its unique antigen is termed t-cell activation. 
upon binding to pmhc, the tcr initiates a signalling cascade, involving transcription factor activation and cytoskeletal remodelling resulting in t cell activation. active t cells secrete cytokines, undergo rapid proliferation, have cytotoxic activity and differentiate into effector and memory cells. when the tcr is triggered, t cells form an immunological synapse allowing them to stay in contact with the antigen presenting cell for several hours.
on a population level, t cell activation depends on the strength of tcr stimulation, the dose–response curve of ligand to cytokine production is sigmoidal. however, t cell activation on a single cell level can be characterised by a digital switch-like response, meaning the t cell is fully activated if the stimulus is higher than a given threshold, otherwise the t cell stay in its non-activated state. there is no intermediate activation state. the robust sigmoid dose-response curve on population level results from individual t cells having slightly different thresholds.t cells need three signals to become fully activated. signal 1 is provided by the t-cell receptor when recognising a specific antigen on a mhc molecule. signal 2 comes from co-stimulatory receptors such as cd28, presented on the surface of other immune cells.  it is expressed only when an infection was detected by the innate immune system, it is a ""danger indicating signal"". this two-signal system makes sure that t cells only respond to harmful pathogens and not to self-antigens. an additional third signal is provided by cytokines, which regulate the differentiation of t cells into different subsets of effector t cells.
there are myriad molecules involved in the complex biochemical process (called trans-membrane signaling) by which t-cell activation occurs. below, the signalling cascade is described in detail.


=== receptor activation ===
the initial triggering follows the mechanism common for all ntr receptor family members. 
once the tcr binds a specific pmhc, the tyrosine residues of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (itams) in its cd3 adaptor proteins are phosphorylated. the residues serve as docking sites for downstream signalling molecules, which can propagate the signal.
phosphorylation of itams is mediate by the scr kinase lck. lck is anchored to the plasma membrane by associating with the co-receptor cd4 or cd8, depending on the t cell subtype. cd4 is expressed on helper t cells and regulatory t cells, and is specific for mhc class ii. cd8, on the other hand, specific for mhc class i, is expressed on cytotoxic t cells.
binding of the co-receptor to the mhc bring lck in close proximity to the cd3 itams. it has been shown that 40% of lck is active even before the tcr binds pmhc and therefore has the ability to constantly phosphorylate the tcr. tonic tcr signalling is avoided by the presence of phosphatase cd45 that removes phosphorylation from tyrosine residues and inhibits signal initiation. upon binding the balance of kinase activity to phosphatase activity is perturbed, leading to a surplus of phosphorylation and initiation of the signal. how such perturbation is accomplished by tcr binding is still debated. mechanisms involving conformational change of tcr, tcr aggregation and kinetic segregation have been suggested.
tyrosine kinase fyn might be involved in itam phosphorylation but is not essential for tcr signalling.


=== proximal tcr signaling ===
phosphorylated itams in the cytoplasmic tails of cd3 recruit protein tyrosine kinase zap70 that can bind to the phosphorylated tyrosine residues with its sh2 domain. this brings zap70 into close proximity to lck which results to its phosphorylation and activation by lck. lck phosphorylates a number of different proteins in the tcr pathway.
once activated, zap70 is able to phosphorylate multiple tyrosine residues of the transmembrane protein lat. 
lat is a scaffold protein associated with the membrane. it itself does not have any catalytic activity but it provides binding sites for signalling molecules via phosphorylated tyrosine residues. lat associates with another scaffolding protein slp-76 via the grap2 adaptor protein, which provides additional binding sites. together lat and slp-76 provide a platform for the recruitment of many downstream signalling molecules. by bringing these signalling molecules into close proximity, they can then be activated by lck, zap70 and others kinases. therefore, the lat/slp76 complex act as a highly cooperative signalosome.molecules that bind the lat/slp76 complex include: phospholipase cγ1 (plcγ1), sos via a grb2 adaptor, itk, vav, nck1 and fyb.


=== signal transduction to the nucleus ===
plcγ is a very important enzyme in the pathway as it generates second messenger molecules. it is activated by the tyrosine kinase itk which is recruited to the cell membrane by binding to phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (pip3). pip3 is produced by the action of phosphoinositide 3-kinase(pi-3k), which phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (pip2) to produce pip3. it is not known that pi-3k is activated by the t cell receptor itself, but there is evidence that cd28, a co-stimulatory receptor providing the second signal, is able to activate pi-3k. the interaction between plcγ, itk and pi-3k could be the point in the pathway where the first and the second signal are integrated. only if both signals are present, plcγ is activated.
once plcγ is activated by phosphorylation, it hydrolyses pip2 into two secondary messenger molecules, namely the membrane-bound diacyl glycerol(dag) and the soluble inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (ip3).these second messenger molecules amplify the tcr signal and distribute the prior localised activation to the entire cell and activate protein cascades that finally lead to the activation of transcription factors. 
transcription factors involved in t cell signalling pathway are the nfat, nf-κb and ap1, a heterodimer of proteins fos and jun. all three transcription factors are needed to activate the transcription of interleukin-2(il2) gene.


==== nfat ====
nfat activation depends on calcium signaling. 
ip3 produced by plc-γ is no longer bound to the membrane and diffuses rapidly in the cell. binding of ip3 to calcium channel receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum (er) induces the release of calcium (ca2+) into the cytosol. the resulting low ca2+ concentration in the er causes stim1 clustering on the er membrane, which in turn leads to activation of cell membrane crac channels that allows additional calcium to flow into the cytosol from the extracellular space. therefore, levels of ca2+ are strongly increased in the t cell. this cytosolic calcium binds calmodulin, inducing a conformational change of the protein such that it can then bind and activate calcineurin. calcineurin, in turn, dephosphorylates nfat. in its deactivated state, nfat cannot enter the nucleus as its nuclear localisation sequence (nls) cannot be recognised by nuclear transporters due to phosphorylation by gsk-3. when dephosphorylated by calcineurin translocation of nfat into the nucleus is possible.
additionally, there is evidence that pi-3k via signal molecules recruits the protein kinase akt to the cell membrane. akt is able to deactivate gsk3 and thereby inhibiting the phosphorylation of nfat, which could contribute to nfat activation.


==== nf-κb ====
nf-κb activation is initiated by dag, the second, membrane bound product of plcγ hydrolysation of pip2. dag binds and recruits protein kinase c θ (pkcθ) to the membrane where it can activated the membrane bound scaffold protein carma1. carma1 then undergoes a conformational change which allow it to oligomerise and bind the adapter proteins bcl10, card domain and malt1. this multisubunit complex binds the ubiquitin ligase traf6. ubiquitination of traf6 serves as scaffold to recruit nemo, iκb kinase (ikk) and tak1. tak 1 phosphorylates ikk, which in turn phosphorylates the nf-κb inhibitor i-κb, leading to the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of i-κb.
i-κb blocks the nls of nf-κb therefore preventing its translocation to the nucleus. once i-κb is degraded, it cannot bind to nf-κb and the nls of nf-κb becomes accessible for nuclear translocation.


==== ap1 ====
activation of ap1 involves three mapk signalling pathways. these pathway use a phosphorylation cascade of three successive acting protein kinases to transmit a signal. 
the three mapk pathways in t cells involve kinases of different specificities belonging to each of the map3k, map2k, mapk families. initial activation is done by the gtpase ras or rac which phosphorylate the map3k.
a cascade involving the enzymes raf, mek1, erk results in the phosphorylation of jun, conformational change allows jun to bind to fos and hence ap-1 to form.  ap-1 then acts as transcription factor. raf is activated via the second messenger dag, sos, and ras. dag recruits among other proteins the ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein (rasgrp), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (gef), to the membrane. rasgrp activates the small gtpase ras by exchanging guanosine diphosphate (gdp) bound to ras against guanosine triphosphate (gtp). ras can also be activated by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor sos which binds to the lat signalosom. ras then initiates the mapk cascade.
the second mapk cascade with mekk1, jnkk, jnk induces protein expression of jun. another cascade, also involving mekk1 as mapk3, but then activating mkk3 /6 and p38 induces fos transcription. activation of mekk1, additionally to being activated by ras, involves slp-76 recruiting the gef vav to the lat signalosom, which then activates the gtpase rac. rac and ras activate mekk1 and thereby initiate the mapk cascade.

plaisance (paris métro),non_science,"plaisance (french pronunciation: [plɛzɑ̃s] (listen)) is a station on line line 13 of the paris métro in the 14th arrondissement.
the station opened on 21 january 1937 as part of the original line 14 between bienvenüe and porte de vanves. this line became part of line 13 on 9 november 1976.
the station is named after the château du maine which was built in the 17th century and possessed an immense park. the word ""plaisance"" is equivalent to the english ""pleasance"", that is a pleasure garden. it was purchased in 1842 by a surveyor called couesnon whose son subdivided it, creating the district of plaisance between 1858 and 1860, which became one of the largest slums of paris. the compagnie générale des omnibus (a major 19th century operator of horse buses and later trams and motor buses) razed the castle to build garages.

30s ribosomal protein s18 (escherichia coli k-12),protein,"a ribosomal protein (r-protein or rprotein) is any of the proteins that, in conjunction with rrna, make up the ribosomal subunits involved in the cellular process of translation. a large part of the knowledge about these organic molecules has come from the study of e. coli ribosomes. all ribosomal proteins have been isolated and many specific antibodies have been produced. these, together with electronic microscopy and the use of certain reactives, have allowed for the determination of the topography of the proteins in the ribosome. e. coli, other bacteria and archaea have a 30s small subunit and a 50s large subunit, whereas humans and yeasts have a 40s small subunit and a 60s large subunit. equivalent subunits are frequently numbered differently between bacteria, archaea, yeasts and humans. more recently, a near-complete (near)atomic picture of the ribosomal proteins is emerging from the latest high-resolution cryo-em data (including pdb id: 5afi).


== conservation ==

ribosomal proteins are among the most highly conserved proteins across all life forms. among the 40 proteins found in various small ribosomal subunits (rpss), 15 subunits are universally conserved across prokaryotes and eukaryotes. however, 7 subunits are only found in bacteria (bs21, bs6, bs16, bs18, bs20, bs21, and bthx), while 17 subunits are only found in archaea and eukaryotes. typically 22 proteins are found in bacterial small subunits and 32 in yeast, human and most likely most other eukaryotic species. twenty-seven (out of 32) proteins of the eukaryotic small ribosomal subunit proteins are also present in archaea (no ribosomal protein is exclusively found in archaea), confirming that they are more closely related to eukaryotes than to bacteria.among the large ribosomal subunit (rpls), 18 proteins are universal, i.e. found in both bacteria, eukaryotes, and archaea. 14 proteins are only found in bacteria, while 27 proteins are only found in archaea and eukaryotes. again, archaea have no proteins unique to them.


== essentiality ==
despite their high conservation over billions of years of evolution, the absence of several ribosomal proteins in certain species shows that ribosomal subunits have been added and lost over the course of evolution. this is also reflected by the fact that several ribosomal proteins do not appear to be essential when deleted. for instance, in e. coli nine ribosomal proteins (ul15, bl21, ul24, bl27, ul29, ul30, bl34, us9, and us17) are nonessential for survival when deleted. taken together with previous results, 22 of the 54 e. coli ribosomal protein genes can be individually deleted from the genome. similarly, 16 ribosomal proteins (ul1, bl9, ul15, ul22, ul23, bl28, ul29, bl32, bl33.1, bl33.2, bl34, bl35, bl36, bs6, bs20, and bs21) were successfully deleted in bacillus subtilis. in conjunction with previous reports, 22 ribosomal proteins have been shown to be nonessential in b. subtilis, at least for cell proliferation.


== assembly ==


=== in e. coli ===
the ribosome of e. coli has about 22 proteins in the small subunit (labelled s1 to s22) and 33 proteins in the large subunit (somewhat counter-intuitively called l1 to l36). all of them are different with three exceptions: one protein is found in both subunits (s20 and l26), l7 and l12 are acetylated and methylated forms of the same protein, and l8 is a complex of l7/l12 and l10. in addition, l31 is known to exist in two forms, the full length at 7.9 kilodaltons (kda) and fragmented at 7.0 kda. this is why the number of proteins in a ribosome is of 56. except for s1 (with a molecular weight of 61.2 kda), the other proteins range in weight between 4.4 and 29.7 kda.recent de novo proteomics experiments where the authors characterized in vivo ribosome-assembly intermediates and associated assembly factors from wild-type escherichia coli cells using a general quantitative mass spectrometry (qms) approach have confirmed the presence of all the known small and large subunit components and have identified a total of 21 known and potentially new ribosome-assembly-factors that co-localise with various ribosomal particles.


==== disposition in the small ribosomal subunit ====
in the small (30s) subunit of e. coli ribosomes, the proteins denoted us4, us7, us8, us15, us17, bs20 bind independently to 16s rrna. after assembly of these primary binding proteins, us5, bs6, us9, us12, us13, bs16, bs18, and us19 bind to the growing ribosome. these proteins also potentiate the addition of us2, us3, us10, us11, us14, and bs21. protein binding to helical junctions is important for initiating the correct tertiary fold of rna and to organize the overall structure. nearly all the proteins contain one or more globular domains. moreover, nearly all contain long extensions that can contact the rna in far-reaching regions. additional stabilization results from the proteins' basic residues, as these neutralize the charge repulsion of the rna backbone. protein–protein interactions also exist to hold structure together by electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions. theoretical investigations pointed to correlated effects of protein-binding onto binding affinities during the assembly process


=== in eukaryotes ===
ribosomes in eukaryotes contain 79–80 proteins and four ribosomal rna (rrna) molecules.
general or specialized chaperones solubilize the ribosomal proteins and facilitate their import into the nucleus. assembly of the eukaryotic ribosome appears to be driven by the ribosomal proteins in vivo when assembly is also aided by chaperones.  most ribosomal proteins assemble with rrna co-transcriptionally, becoming associated more stably as assembly proceeds, and the active sites of both subunits are constructed last.


== table of ribosomal proteins ==
different nomenclatures were used for the same ribosomal different organisms in the past. not only was the name not consistent across domains, the names were also different between human and baker's yeast, both eukaryotes. all this confusion was caused by researchers assigning numbers before the sequences were known, causing trouble for later research. the following tables use the unified nomenclature by ban et al, 2014. the same nomenclature is used by uniprot's ""family"" curation.in general, cellular ribosomal proteins are to be called simply using the cross domain name, e.g. ""ul14"" for what is currently called l23 in humans. a suffix is used for the organellar versions, so that ""ul14m"" refers to the human mitochondrial ul14 (mrpl14). organelle-specific proteins use their own cross-domain prefixes, for example ""ms33"" for mrps33.

her sister's secret,non_science,"her sister's secret is a 1946 drama film directed by edgar g. ulmer and starring nancy coleman, margaret lindsay, phillip reed, and regis toomey. it centers around a woman who falls in love with a soldier.  believing she has been abandoned, she gives her baby to her married sister. the picture was produced and distributed by producers releasing corporation. the screenplay was by anne green from the novel dark angel by gina kaus.


== plot ==
during world war ii, toni dubois meets soldier dick connolly at pepe's. they have breakfast there the following day, and dick proposes to toni, who decides to wait until six weeks have passed before meeting again to see if they truly love each other. however, during the six weeks pause, dick's leave gets canceled, and toni believes she was a one night stand because the letter he wrote to her explaining his leave situation becomes lost. toni decides to visit her sister renee, who is married to bill gordon. when bill is shipped overseas, toni reveals she is pregnant from her one night with dick. as renee and bill are unable to have their own child, renee asks if she can have the baby and tell bill it is hers. toni gives birth to a boy, who renee names billy. renee takes the child and toni agrees not to see little billy for another three years.
two years later, toni stays home with her ill father, mr. dubois. mr. dubois tells her to not stay home when he dies. when he passes, toni leaves and heads to renee's, where she learns from housemaid etta that bill and renee have gone out of town for a while. toni attempts to take billy away but etta stops her. when bill and renee return home, etta tells them of what happened. meanwhile, dick is discharged from the army, and he comes to renee's house looking for toni. after he leaves, renee tells toni that dick was at her house. toni insists upon taking billy back, but renee refuses, stating that billy has become her son after two years. toni tries to take billy away again, but billy runs away from toni in fear, causing toni to accept that bill and renee will raise billy. bill reveals that he knew the truth about billy's birth, and thanks toni for allowing them to raise him.

== production ==
directed by edgar g. ulmer, her sister's secret was produced by henry brash and written by anne green. it is based on the novel ""dark angel"" by gina kaus. working titles for the film were between two sisters and once and for all.the film was produced by producers releasing corporation. they increased their usual film budget for her sister's secret, referring to it as their ""first million-dollar production"" in advertising.


== release and reception ==
producers releasing corporation released the film in september 1946.the new york times wrote of the film, ""in fashioning her sister's secret as their first million-dollar production, the film makers at prc may have been imbued with the theory that soap operas not only affect a lot of people but also sell soap and make money. for the romantic drama, which came to the gotham yesterday, follows the pattern set by many of those lachrymose radio offerings"" and said that ""the sets of ""her sister's secret"" are neat and interesting, attributes, which, sadly enough, can hardly be applied to its story."" a reviewer for the northwest chicago film society opined the film was ""a superb melodrama"" and that ""you won’t soon forget her sister’s secret.""richard brody of the new yorker remarked that ""the actors are hardly charismatic, but ulmer, capturing their frozen energy in the shifting perspective of daringly long takes, infuses them with his rhapsodically compassionate vision."" brody also wrote that ""edgar g. ulmer cuts loose with a wild creativity that yoked his theatrical imagination to a keen view of the traumatic times,"" and that ulmer ""wrings the last drop of true emotion from every soap-operatic twist, while also baring the domestic scars of war’s violence, sacrifice, and, above all, silence."" leonard maltin gave the film two and a half stars, saying that it was a ""fair weeper with competent cast.""in 1947, the film was banned in ireland by richard hayes for featuring an unwed mother, a decision which was eventually reversed by the appeal board. this reversal was described by irish film historian kevin rockett as ""an indication of the slightly more flexible approached being adopted in the post-war years by the appeal board.""


== preservation ==
the film was restored by the ucla film & television archive, with funding provided by the film foundation and the franco-american cultural fund.  a fine-grain was recently struck from the original nitrate negative, from which a new negative and superb new print were produced.  among other earlier exhibitions, the new print was exhibited at the museum of modern art in new york city in november 2014.

"1-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate phosphodiesterase delta-3 (mouse)",protein,"1-phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate phosphodiesterase delta-3 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the plcd3 gene.


== function ==
this gene encodes a member of the phospholipase c family, which catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to generate the second messengers diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (ip3). diacylglycerol and ip3 mediate a variety of cellular responses to extracellular stimuli by inducing protein kinase c and increasing cytosolic ca2+ concentrations. this enzyme localizes to the plasma membrane and requires calcium for activation. its activity is inhibited by spermine, sphingosine, and several phospholipids.

goff,non_science,"jared thomas goff (born october 14, 1994) is an american football quarterback for the los angeles rams of the national football league (nfl). he played college football at california, where he was a first-team all-pac-12, and was selected by the rams as the first overall pick of the 2016 nfl draft. 
after an unsuccessful rookie season, goff rebounded in his sophomore year when he helped lead the rams to their first winning season in 14 years and their first playoff appearance in 13 years. goff oversaw further improved fortunes for the rams in 2018, which saw the team earn a trip to super bowl liii, the franchise's first super bowl appearance since 2001. he also received pro bowl honors in both seasons.


== early life ==
goff was born in san rafael, california and raised in novato, california, the son of jerry goff, a former major league baseball player. he also has an older sister named lauren. goff grew up as a san francisco 49ers fan and wears the number 16 as a tribute to joe montana, who played for the 49ers before goff was born.goff attended marin catholic high school in kentfield, california, and graduated in 2013. he played for the football team, throwing for 7,687 yards and 93 touchdowns with 18 interceptions in three varsity seasons at marin catholic, completing 477-of-767 passes (62.2%) for teams that combined to post a 39–4 overall record and 21–0 marin county athletic league mark on their way to an appearance in the state title game, one north coast section crown, three ncs playoff appearances, and three mcal championships.


== college career ==
goff was recruited by a number of college programs and received scholarship offers from boise state, fresno state, and washington state before choosing to attend the university of california, berkeley. goff was a mid-year enrollee at cal in january 2013 and joined the golden bears for 2013 spring practices. in august, he was named starting quarterback for the 2013 season over redshirt freshman quarterback zach kline, becoming the first true freshman quarterback in cal history to start a season opener.goff set 26 cal records. this included passing yards (12,220), passing yards per game (329.7 ypg), touchdown passes (96), completions (977), passing attempts (1,569), total offense (12,086), and total plays (1,739). he is second only to aaron rodgers on cal's all-time list for passing efficiency (143.95).


=== 2013 season ===

under new head coach sonny dykes, goff started all twelve games in the 2013 season, and although the team finished 1–11, he set cal single-season records for passing yards (3,508), yardage gained (3,508), total offense (3,446), passes completed (320), and passes attempted (530). goff finished his true freshman season with a 60.3 completion percentage with 18 touchdown passes and 10 interceptions.


=== 2014 season ===
in 2014, goff was again the starting quarterback for the golden bears. in a september 27 matchup against the colorado buffaloes, goff threw a career-high seven touchdown passes, completing 24-of-42 passes for 458 yards. on october 4, goff threw for a new career-high and school-record 527 yards and five touchdowns in a 60–59 victory over washington state. goff helped lead the golden bears to a 5–7 season, a four-win improvement over the 2013 season. he finished the 2014 season with 3,973 yards, 35 touchdowns, and a 62% completion rate, once again setting new school records.


=== 2015 season ===
in 2015, as a junior, goff led the bears to a 7–5 regular-season finish, clinching cal's first winning season since 2011. going into the season, goff was projected as the top quarterback for the 2016 nfl draft by mel kiper jr. and todd mcshay. on november 14, 2015, goff threw for 453 yards and six touchdowns in a 54–24 victory over oregon state, earning pac-12 offensive player of the week honors for the first time. two weeks later, goff set a new cal single-game record with 542 passing yards in a 48–46 come-from-behind victory over arizona state, earning player of the week honors for a second time. in the 2015 armed forces bowl, goff threw for six touchdown passes and 467 yards, leading the bears to a 55–36 victory over air force.in 2015, goff set a new pac-12 single-season passing-yardage record (4,714), and also set a new conference record for touchdown passes in a season (43). he earned first-team all-pac-12 honors. he was the first cal quarterback to earn first-team all-pac-12 honors since rodgers in 2004 while leading an 8–5 cal team to a winning record and bowl game for the first time since 2011 as well as a post-season win for the first time since 2008.during goff's time as quarterback, the golden bears never beat an in-state rival, going 0–9 against stanford, ucla, and usc, and they also went 0–3 against division rival oregon. goff's father has been quoted as saying the lack of a marquee win bothered his son. goff majored in sociology during his time at cal.after his junior season, goff announced his decision to forgo his senior season and enter the 2016 nfl draft.

=== 2016 season: rookie year ===

in mid-february 2016, most analysts had goff projected to be selected in the early first round of the draft, with the second overall pick of the cleveland browns being his most frequently predicted landing spot, or the san francisco 49ers with the seventh overall pick. despite not excelling at the physical tests at the nfl scouting combine, goff still improved his draft stock with a strong showing in the positional drills. goff also reportedly scored a 36 on his wonderlic exam.on april 28, 2016, goff was selected with the first overall pick by the los angeles rams in the 2016 nfl draft. the rams had traded up in the first round and acquired the first pick from the tennessee titans. goff, roman gabriel, and terry baker share the distinction of being the only quarterbacks drafted by the rams in the first round of the nfl draft as a los angeles-based franchise. goff was the second rams quarterback to be taken first overall in six years; the rams had selected sam bradford first overall six years earlier. 
on june 9, 2016, goff signed a four-year deal worth $27.9 million in guaranteed money, including an $18.6 million signing bonus.on november 15, goff was named the rams' starting quarterback for the game against the miami dolphins after spending the first nine games as the backup to veteran quarterback case keenum. goff then started the final seven games of the season. on november 20, 2016, he made his professional debut and first career start against the miami dolphins and lost 14–10, completing 17-of-31 attempts for 134 passing yards, with no touchdowns or interceptions. the following week against the new orleans saints, he threw his first career touchdown pass on a 24-yard completion to wide receiver tavon austin in the first quarter and had his first career interception in the third quarter after saints safety kenny vaccaro picked off his pass attempt. goff finished the game with 20-of-32 completed pass attempts for 214 yards and three touchdowns and one interception in a 21–49 loss.in week 14, goff had 24 completions out of 41 pass attempts for 235 yards and two interceptions in a 42–14 loss to the atlanta falcons. in addition, he had his first career rushing touchdown on a two-yard run in the fourth quarter.in his rookie season, goff made seven starts. the rams lost each of those games finishing with an overall record of 4–12. he completed 112-of-205 passes for 1,089 yards, five passing touchdowns, and seven interceptions while also rushing for 16 yards and a touchdown.

phosphatidylserine 40:4(1-),reagent,"phosphatidylserine (abbreviated ptd-l-ser or ps) is a phospholipid and is a component of the cell membrane. it plays a key role in cell cycle signaling, specifically in relation to apoptosis. it is a key pathway for viruses to enter cells via apoptotic mimicry.


== structure ==
phosphatidylserine is a phospholipid—more specifically a glycerophospholipid—which consists of two fatty acids attached in ester linkage to the first and second carbon of glycerol and serine attached through a phosphodiester linkage to the third carbon of the glycerol.phosphatidylserine sourced from plants differs in fatty acid composition from that sourced from animals.


== introduction ==
phosphatidylserine (ps) is the major acidic phospholipid class that accounts for 13–15 % of the phospholipids in the human cerebral cortex [1]. in the plasma membrane, ps is localized exclusively in the cytoplasmic leaflet where it forms part of protein docking sites necessary for the activation of several key signaling pathways. these include the akt, protein kinase c (pkc) and raf-1 signaling that is known to stimulate neuronal survival, neurite growth, and synaptogenesis [2–7]. modulation of the ps level in the plasma membrane of neurons has a significant impact on these signaling processes.


== biosynthesis ==

phosphatidylserine is biosynthesized in bacteria by condensing the amino acid serine with cdp (cytidine diphosphate)-activated phosphatidic acid. in mammals, phosphatidylserine is produced by base-exchange reactions with phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. conversely, phosphatidylserine can also give rise to phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine, although in animals the pathway to generate phosphatidylcholine from phosphatidylserine only operates in the liver.


== dietary sources ==
the average daily phosphatidylserine intake in a western diet is estimated to be 130 mg. phosphatidylserine may be found in meat and fish. only small amounts are found in dairy products and vegetables, with the exception of white beans and soy lecithin. phosphatidylserine is found in soy lecithin at about 3% of total phospholipids.table 1. phosphatidylserine content in different foods.


== supplementation ==


=== health claims ===
a panel of the european food safety authority concluded that a cause and effect relationship cannot be established between the consumption of phosphatidylserine and “memory and cognitive functioning in the elderly”, “mental health/cognitive function” and “stress reduction and enhanced memory function”. this conclusion is due bovine brain cortex- and soy-based phosphatidylserine are different substances and might, therefore, have different biological activities. therefore, the results of studies using phosphatidylserine from different sources cannot be generalized.


==== cognition ====
in may, 2003 the food and drug administration gave ""qualified health claim"" status to phosphatidylserine thus allowing labels to state ""consumption of phosphatidylserine may reduce the risk of dementia and cognitive dysfunction in the elderly"" along with the disclaimer ""very limited and preliminary scientific research suggests that phosphatidylserine may reduce the risk of cognitive dysfunction in the elderly."" according to the fda, there is a lack of scientific agreement amongst qualified experts that a relationship exists between phosphatidylserine and cognitive function.more recent reviews have suggested that the relationship may be more robust, though the mechanism remains unclear. a 2020 meta-analysis of relevant clinical trials found that phosphatidylserine is likely effective for enhancing cognitive function in older people with mild cognitive impairment. some studies have suggested that whether the phosphatidylserine is plant- or animal-derived may have significance, with the fda's statement applying specifically to soy-derived products.


=== safety ===
initially, phosphatidylserine supplements were derived from bovine cortex. however, due to the risk of potential transfer of infectious diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (or ""mad cow disease""), soy-derived supplements became an alternative. a 2002 safety report determined supplementation in elder people at a dosage of 200 mg three times daily to be safe. concerns about the safety of soy products persist, and some manufacturers of phosphatidylserine use sunflower lecithin instead of soy lecithin as a source of raw material production.

1-palmitoyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate(2-),reagent,"phospholipids, also known as phosphatides, are a class of lipids whose molecule has a hydrophilic ""head"" containing a phosphate group, and two hydrophobic ""tails"" derived from fatty acids, joined by a glycerol molecule. the phosphate group can be modified with simple organic molecules such as choline, ethanolamine or serine.
phospholipids are a key component of all cell membranes. they can form lipid bilayers because of their amphiphilic characteristic. in eukaryotes, cell membranes also contain another class of lipid, sterol, interspersed among the phospholipids. the combination provides fluidity in two dimensions combined with mechanical strength against rupture. purified phospholipids are produced commercially and have found applications in nanotechnology and materials science.the first phospholipid identified in 1847 as such in biological tissues was lecithin, or phosphatidylcholine, in the egg yolk of chickens by the french chemist and pharmacist theodore nicolas gobley.


== phospholipids in biological membranes ==


=== arrangement ===
the phospholipids are amphiphilic. the hydrophilic end usually contains a negatively charged phosphate group, and the hydrophobic end usually consists of two ""tails"" that are long fatty acid residues. 
in aqueous solutions, phospholipids are driven by hydrophobic interactions that result in the fatty acid tails aggregating to minimize interactions with water molecules. the result is often a phospholipid bilayer: a membrane that consists of two layers of oppositely oriented phospholipid molecules, with their heads exposed to the liquid on both sides, and with the tails directed into the membrane. that is the dominant structural motif of the membranes of all cells and of some other biological structures, such as vescicles or virus coatings.

in biological membranes, the phospholipids often occur with other molecules (e.g., proteins, glycolipids, sterols) in a bilayer such as a cell membrane. lipid bilayers occur when hydrophobic tails line up against one another, forming a membrane of hydrophilic heads on both sides facing the water.


=== dynamics ===
these specific properties allow phospholipids to play an important role in the cell membrane. their movement can be described by the fluid mosaic model, that describes the membrane as a mosaic of lipid molecules that act as a solvent for all the substances and proteins within it, so proteins and lipid molecules are then free to diffuse laterally through the lipid matrix and migrate over the membrane. sterols contribute to membrane fluidity by hindering the packing together of phospholipids. however, this model has now been superseded, as through the study of lipid polymorphism it is now known that the behaviour of lipids under physiological (and other) conditions is not simple.

== applications ==
phospholipids have been widely used to prepare liposomal, ethosomal and other nanoformulations of topical, oral and parenteral drugs for differing reasons like improved bio-availability, reduced toxicity and increased permeability across membranes. liposomes are often composed of phosphatidylcholine-enriched phospholipids and may also contain mixed phospholipid chains with surfactant properties. the ethosomal formulation of ketoconazole using phospholipids is a promising option for transdermal delivery in fungal infections.


== simulations ==
computational simulations of phospholipids are often performed using molecular dynamics with force fields such as gromos, charmm, or amber.


== characterization ==
phospholipids are optically highly birefringent, i.e. their refractive index is different along their axis as opposed to perpendicular to it. measurement of birefringence can be achieved using cross polarisers in a microscope to obtain an image of e.g. vesicle walls or using techniques such as dual polarisation interferometry to quantify lipid order or disruption in supported bilayers.

there are no simple methods available for analysis of phospholipids since the close range of polarity between different phospholipid species makes detection difficult. oil chemists often use spectroscopy to determine total phosphorus abundance and then calculate approximate mass of phospholipids based on molecular weight of expected fatty acid species. modern lipid profiling employs more absolute methods of analysis, with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (nmr spectroscopy), particularly 31p-nmr, while hplc-elsd provides relative values.


== phospholipid synthesis ==
phospholipid synthesis occurs in the cytosolic side of er membrane  that is studded with proteins that act in synthesis (gpat and lpaat acyl transferases, phosphatase and choline phosphotransferase) and allocation (flippase and floppase). eventually a vesicle will bud off from the er containing phospholipids destined for the cytoplasmic cellular membrane on its exterior leaflet and phospholipids destined for the exoplasmic cellular membrane on its inner leaflet.


== sources ==
common sources of industrially produced phospholipids are soya, rapeseed, sunflower, chicken eggs, bovine milk, fish eggs etc. each source has a unique profile of individual phospholipid species as well as fatty acids and consequently differing applications in food, nutrition, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and drug delivery.


== in signal transduction ==
some types of phospholipid can be split to produce products that function as second messengers in signal transduction. examples include phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (pip2), that can be split by the enzyme phospholipase c into inositol triphosphate (ip3) and diacylglycerol (dag), which both carry out the functions of the gq type of g protein in response to various stimuli and intervene in various processes from long term depression in neurons to leukocyte signal pathways started by chemokine receptors.phospholipids also intervene in prostaglandin signal pathways as the raw material used by lipase enzymes to produce the prostaglandin precursors. in plants they serve as the raw material to produce jasmonic acid, a plant hormone similar in structure to prostaglandins that mediates defensive responses against pathogens.


== food technology ==
phospholipids can act as emulsifiers, enabling oils to form a colloid with water. phospholipids are one of the components of lecithin which is found in egg-yolks, as well as being extracted from soybeans, and is used as a food additive in many products, and can be purchased as a dietary supplement. lysolecithins are typically used for water-oil emulsions like margarine, due to their higher hlb ratio.


== phospholipid derivatives ==
see table below for an extensive list.natural phospholipid derivates:
egg pc (egg lecithin), egg pg, soy pc, hydrogenated soy pc, sphingomyelin as natural phospholipids.
synthetic phospholipid derivates:
phosphatidic acid (dmpa, dppa, dspa)

melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 1 (rat),protein,"melanin-concentrating hormone (mch) is a cyclic 19-amino acid orexigenic hypothalamic peptide originally isolated from the pituitary gland of teleost fish, where it controls skin pigmentation. in mammals it is involved in the regulation of feeding behavior, mood, sleep-wake cycle and energy balance.


== structure ==
mch is a cyclic 19-amino acid neuropeptide, as it is a polypeptide chain that is able to act as a neurotransmitter. mch neurons are mainly concentrated in the lateral hypothalamic area, zona incerta, and the incerto-hypothalamic area, but they are also located, in much smaller amounts, in the paramedian pontine reticular formation (pprf), medial preoptic area, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, and the olfactory tubercle. mch is activated by binding to two g-coupled protein receptors (gcprs), mchr1 and mchr2. mchr2 has only been identified in certain species such as humans, dogs, ferrets, and rhesus monkeys, while other mammals such as rodents and rabbits do not have the receptor. mch is cleaved from prepro-mch (ppmch), a 165 amino acid polypeptide which also contains the neuropeptides ge and ei.


== tissue distribution ==
mch has also been found in peripheral structures outside of the brain. both the spleen and thymus have shown significant levels of mch in mammals in multiple studies. the bloodstream seems to carry mch around the body in mammals as well, though it is a very amount in humans.mch is found in the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus solely in female brains in rat models. mch has also only been found in the medial preoptic area and the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus during lactation.


== activation and deactivation ==
mch neurons depolarize in response to high glucose concentrations. this mechanism seems to be related to glucose being used as a reactant to form atp, which also causes mch neurons to depolarize. the neurotransmitter, glutamate, also causes mch neurons to depolarize, while another neurotransmitter, gaba, causes mch neurons to hyperpolarize. orexin also depolarizes mch neurons. mch neurons seems to have an inhibitory response to mch, but does not cause the neurons to become hyperpolarized. norepinephrine has an inhibitory effect on mch neurons as does acetylcholine. mch neurons hyperpolarize in response to serotonin. cannabinoids have an excitatory effect on mch neurons.some research has shown that dopamine has an inhibitory effect on mch neurons, but further research is needed to fully characterize this interaction.


== function ==


=== sleep ===
mch and the hormone orexin have an antagonistic relationship with one another with regards to the sleep cycle, with orexin being almost entirely active during wake periods and mch being more active during sleep periods. mch also promotes sleep, and within a sleep period increased levels of mch seem to increase the amount of time spent in rem sleep and slow waves sleep. increased levels of mch can also increase the amount of time spent in both rem and nrem, which in turn increases total sleep duration. increased levels of sugar promotes mch and its effect on sleep and conserving energy.


=== maternal behavior ===
the presence of mch in specific locations solely during lactation is thought to help to promote maternal behavior in individuals.


=== eating behaviors and energy conservation ===
an increased presence of mch can cause increased eating levels and has been linked to an increase in body mass. inversely, a decrease in the amount of mch present can cause decreased levels in eating. increased amounts of mch in olfactory regions, among others, have also been linked to an increased intake of fatty foods with high caloric content. food that is found to taste good also seems to promote mch, which reinforces the eating of that food. sugar, specifically glucose, seems to promote mch's role in sleep and energy conservation. this promoting of energy conservation has also been linked to higher body mass even when diet is controlled.


=== reproduction ===
it has been postulated that mch has a modulatory role with the release of luteinizing hormone (lh) either by directly acting on the pituitary gland or indirectly by affecting gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh) in the hypothalamus. estrogen seems to be necessary in order for mch to affect reproduction.


=== skin pigmentation ===
though mch was initially discovered for its role of determining the pigmentation in fish, trying to determine mch's role in skin pigmentation in mammals has been much more difficult to determine. however, mchr1 has been found in human melanocytes and some melanoma cells, so mch is able to bind to these cells as well as keratinocytes though they do not express mchr1. in melanocytes, mch seems to have an antagonistic relationship with α-msh, and decreased melanin production. though, more information is needed to fully understand mch's relationship with skin pigmentation in mammals.


== clinical significance ==


=== narcolepsy ===
while mch does promote sleep, there has been no research that links mch to narcolepsy. research has instead found that in individuals with narcolepsy there is a decrease in orexin neurons, which would promote wakefulness, while the number of mch neurons do not vary from the average non-narcoleptic individual.


=== depression and anxiety ===
mch has been linked to depression and anxiety. mchr1 antagonists have been show to act as antidepressants.


=== anorexia ===
interactions between mch and chemokines/cytokines that lead to an overall decrease in mch release and neuron excitability has been linked with infection-induced anorexia. chemokines and cytokines often appear as the result of inflammation or infection, and they can then damage mch neurons, which can lead to anorexia in an individual.


=== skin cancers ===
mch has been identified in both melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma cell lines. however, pro-mch, a precursor to mch, has not been found in melanocytes, keratinocytes, or fibroblasts, which might indicate mch might be brought into these cells by macrophages as part of the immune response. more research is needed to fully determine and understand any relationship between mch and possible immune responses in skin. 


== history ==
mch was initially discovered in the teleost fish; it was found to help determine the fish's skin color. later, a mammalian version of mch was discovered in rats, where most of the functions and localizations are conserved across mammalian species.

matrix metalloproteinase-24,protein,"matrix metalloproteinases (mmps), also known as matrix metallopeptidases or matrixins, are metalloproteinases that are calcium-dependent zinc-containing endopeptidases; other family members are adamalysins, serralysins, and astacins. the mmps belong to a larger family of proteases known as the metzincin superfamily.collectively, these enzymes are capable of degrading all kinds of extracellular matrix proteins, but also can process a number of bioactive molecules. they are known to be involved in the cleavage of cell surface receptors, the release of apoptotic ligands (such as the fas ligand), and chemokine/cytokine inactivation. mmps are also thought to play a major role in cell behaviors such as cell proliferation, migration (adhesion/dispersion), differentiation, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and host defense.
they were first described in vertebrates (1962), including humans, but have since been found in invertebrates and plants. they are distinguished from other endopeptidases by their dependence on metal ions as cofactors, their ability to degrade extracellular matrix, and their specific evolutionary dna sequence.


== history ==
mmps were described initially by jerome gross and charles lapiere (1962), who observed enzymatic activity (collagen triple helix degradation) during tadpole tail metamorphosis (by placing a tadpole tail in a collagen matrix plate). therefore, the enzyme was named interstitial collagenase (mmp-1).
later, it was purified from human skin (1968), and was recognized to be synthesized as a zymogen.the ""cysteine switch"" was described in 1990.


== structure ==
the mmps have a common domain structure. the three common domains are the pro-peptide, the catalytic domain, and the haemopexin-like c-terminal domain, which is linked to the catalytic domain by a flexible hinge region.


=== the pro-peptide ===
the mmps are initially synthesized as inactive zymogens with a pro-peptide domain that must be removed before the enzyme is active. the pro-peptide domain is part of the ""cysteine switch."" this contains a conserved cysteine residue that interacts with the zinc in the active site and prevents binding and cleavage of the substrate, keeping the enzyme in an inactive form. in the majority of the mmps, the cysteine residue is in the conserved sequence prcgxpd. some mmps have a prohormone convertase cleavage site (furin-like) as part of this domain, which, when cleaved, activates the enzyme. mmp-23a and mmp-23b include a transmembrane segment in this domain.


=== the catalytic domain ===
x-ray crystallographic structures of several mmp catalytic domains have shown that this domain is an oblate sphere measuring 35 x 30 x 30 å (3.5 × 3 x 3 nm). the active site is a 20 å  (2 nm) groove that runs across the catalytic domain. in the part of the catalytic domain forming the active site there is a catalytically important zn2+ ion, which is bound by three histidine residues found in the conserved sequence hexxhxxgxxh. hence, this sequence is a zinc-binding motif.
the gelatinases, such as mmp-2, incorporate fibronectin type ii modules inserted immediately before in the zinc-binding motif in the catalytic domain.


=== the hinge region ===
the catalytic domain is connected to the c-terminal domain by a flexible hinge or linker region. this is up to 75 amino acids long, and has no determinable structure.


=== the hemopexin-like c-terminal domain ===

the c-terminal domain has structural similarities to the serum protein hemopexin. it has a four-bladed β-propeller structure. β-propeller structures provide a large flat surface that is thought to be involved in protein–protein interactions. this determines substrate specificity and is the site for interaction with timp's (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases). the hemopexin-like domain is absent in mmp-7, mmp-23, mmp-26, and the plant and nematode. the membrane-bound mmps (mt-mmps) are anchored to the plasma membrane via a transmembrane or a gpi-anchoring domain.


=== catalytic mechanism ===
there are three catalytic mechanisms published.

in the first mechanism, browner m.f. and colleagues proposed the base-catalysis mechanism, carried out by the conserved glutamate residue and the zn2+ ion.
in the second mechanism, the matthews-mechanism, kester and matthews suggested an interaction between a water molecule and the zn2+ ion during the acid-base catalysis.
in the third mechanism, the manzetti-mechanism, manzetti sergio and colleagues provided evidence that a coordination between water and zinc during catalysis was unlikely, and suggested a third mechanism wherein a histidine from the hexxhxxgxxh-motif participates in catalysis by allowing the zn2+ ion to assume a quasi-penta coordinated state, via its dissociation from it. in this state, the zn2+ ion is coordinated with the two oxygen atoms from the catalytic glutamic acid, the substrate's carbonyl oxygen atom, and the two histidine residues, and can polarize the glutamic acid's oxygen atom, proximate the scissile bond, and induce it to act as reversible electron donor. this forms an oxyanion transition state. at this stage, a water molecule acts on the dissociated scissile bond and completes the hydrolyzation of the substrate.


== classification ==

the mmps can be subdivided in different ways.


=== evolutionary ===
use of bioinformatic methods to compare the primary sequences of the mmps suggest the following evolutionary groupings of the mmps: 

mmp-19
mmps 11, 14, 15, 16, and 17
mmp-2 and mmp-9
all the other mmpsanalysis of the catalytic domains in isolation suggests that the catalytic domains evolved further once the major groups had differentiated, as is also indicated by the substrate specificities of the enzymes.


=== functional ===
the most commonly used groupings (by researchers in mmp biology) are based partly on historical assessment of the substrate specificity of the mmp and partly on the cellular localization of the mmp. these groups are the collagenases, the gelatinases, the stromelysins, and the membrane-type mmps (mt-mmps).

the collagenases are capable of degrading triple-helical fibrillar collagens into distinctive 3/4 and 1/4 fragments. these collagens are the major components of bone, cartilage and dentin, and mmps are the only known mammalian enzymes capable of degrading them. the collagenases are no. 1, no. 8,  no. 13, and no. 18. in addition, no. 14 has also been shown to cleave fibrillar collagen, and there is evidence that no. 2 is capable of collagenolysis. in mesh, the current list of collagenases includes no. 1, no. 2, no. 8, no. 9, and no. 13. collagenase no. 14 is present in mesh but not listed as a collagenase, while no. 18 is absent from mesh.
the main substrates of the gelatinases are type iv collagen and gelatin, and these enzymes are distinguished by the presence of an additional domain inserted into the catalytic domain. this gelatin-binding region is positioned immediately before the zinc-binding motif, and forms a separate folding unit that does not disrupt the structure of the catalytic domain. the gelatinases are no. 2 and no. 9.
the stromelysins display a broad ability to cleave extracellular matrix proteins but are unable to cleave the triple-helical fibrillar collagens. the three canonical members of this group are no. 3, no. 10, and no. 11.
all six membrane-type mmps (no. 14, no. 15, no. 16, no. 17, no. 24, and no. 25) have a furin cleavage site in the pro-peptide, which is a feature also shared by no. 11.however, it is becoming increasingly clear that these divisions are somewhat artificial as there are a number of mmps that do not fit into any of the traditional groups.


=== genes ===
matrix metalloproteinases combines with the metal binding protein, metallothionine; thus helping in metal binding mechanism.


== function ==
the mmps play an important role in tissue remodeling associated with various physiological or pathological processes such as morphogenesis, angiogenesis, tissue repair, cirrhosis, arthritis, and metastasis. mmp-2 and mmp-9 are thought to be important in metastasis. mmp-1 is thought to be important in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. recent data suggests active role of mmps in the pathogenesis of aortic aneurysm. excess mmps degrade the structural proteins of the aortic wall.  disregulation of the balance between mmps and timps is also a characteristic of acute and chronic cardiovascular diseases.


== activation ==
 all mmps are synthesized in the latent form (zymogen). they are secreted as proenzymes and require extracellular activation. they can be activated in vitro by many mechanisms including organomercurials, chaotropic agents, and other proteases.


== inhibitors ==
the mmps are inhibited by specific endogenous tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (timps), which comprise a family of four protease inhibitors: timp-1, timp-2, timp-3, and timp-4.
synthetic inhibitors generally contain a chelating group that binds the catalytic zinc atom at the mmp active site tightly. common chelating groups include hydroxamates, carboxylates, thiols, and phosphinyls. hydroxymates are particularly potent inhibitors of mmps and other zinc-dependent enzymes, due to their bidentate chelation of the zinc atom. other substituents of these inhibitors are usually designed to interact with various binding pockets on the mmp of interest, making the inhibitor more or less specific for given mmps.


=== pharmacology ===
doxycycline, at subantimicrobial doses, inhibits mmp activity, and has been used in various experimental systems for this purpose, such as for recalcitrant recurrent corneal erosions. it is used clinically for the treatment of periodontal disease and is the only mmp inhibitor that is widely available clinically. it is sold under the trade name periostat by the company collagenex. minocycline, another tetracycline antibiotic, has also been shown to inhibit mmp activity.
a number of rationally designed mmp inhibitors have shown some promise in the treatment of pathologies that mmps are suspected to be involved in (see above). however, most of these, such as marimastat (bb-2516), a broad-spectrum mmp inhibitor, and cipemastat (ro 32-3555), an mmp-1 selective inhibitor, have performed poorly in clinical trials. the failure of marimastat was partially responsible for the folding of british biotech, which developed it. the failure of these drugs has been due largely to toxicity (in particular, musculo-skeletal toxicity in the case of broad spectrum inhibitors) and failure to show expected results (in the case of trocade, promising results in rabbit arthritis models were not replicated in human trials). the reasons behind the largely disappointing clinical results of mmp inhibitors is unclear, especially in light of their activity in animal models.

novel protein similar to human proliferation-associated 2g4 protein (pa2g4) (zebrafish),protein,"the wnt signaling pathways are a group of signal transduction pathways which begin with proteins that pass signals into a cell through cell surface receptors. the name wnt is a portmanteau created from the names wingless and int-1. wnt signaling pathways use either nearby cell-cell communication (paracrine) or same-cell communication (autocrine). they are highly evolutionarily conserved in animals, which means they are similar across animal species from fruit flies to humans.three wnt signaling pathways have been characterized: the canonical wnt pathway, the noncanonical planar cell polarity pathway, and the noncanonical wnt/calcium pathway. all three pathways are activated by the binding of a wnt-protein ligand to a frizzled family receptor, which passes the biological signal to the dishevelled protein inside the cell. the canonical wnt pathway leads to regulation of gene transcription, and is thought to be negatively regulated in part by the spats1 gene. the noncanonical planar cell polarity pathway regulates the cytoskeleton that is responsible for the shape of the cell. the noncanonical wnt/calcium pathway regulates calcium inside the cell.
wnt signaling was first identified for its role in carcinogenesis, then for its function in embryonic development. the embryonic processes it controls include body axis patterning, cell fate specification, cell proliferation and cell migration. these processes are necessary for proper formation of important tissues including bone, heart and muscle. its role in embryonic development was discovered when genetic mutations in wnt pathway proteins produced abnormal fruit fly embryos. later research found that the genes responsible for these abnormalities also influenced breast cancer development in mice. wnt signaling also controls tissue regeneration in adult bone marrow, skin and intestine.this pathway's clinical importance was demonstrated by mutations that lead to various diseases, including breast and prostate cancer, glioblastoma, type ii diabetes and others. in recent years, researchers reported first successful use of wnt pathway inhibitors in mouse models of disease.


== history and etymology ==
the discovery of wnt signaling was influenced by research on oncogenic (cancer-causing) retroviruses. in 1982, roel nusse and harold varmus infected mice with mouse mammary tumor virus in order to mutate mouse genes to see which mutated genes could cause breast tumors. they identified a new mouse proto-oncogene that they named int1 (integration 1).int1 is highly conserved across multiple species, including humans and drosophila. its presence in d. melanogaster led researchers to discover in 1987 that the int1 gene in drosophila was actually the already known and characterized drosophila gene known as wingless (wg). since previous research by christiane nüsslein-volhard and eric wieschaus (which won them the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1995) had already established the function of wg as a segment polarity gene involved in the formation of the body axis during embryonic development, researchers determined that the mammalian int1 discovered in mice is also involved in embryonic development.continued research led to the discovery of further int1-related genes; however, because those genes were not identified in the same manner as int1, the int gene nomenclature was inadequate. thus, the int/wingless family became the wnt family and int1 became wnt1. the name wnt is a portmanteau of int and wg and stands for ""wingless-related integration site"".


== proteins ==

wnt comprises a diverse family of secreted lipid-modified signaling glycoproteins that are 350–400 amino acids in length. the lipid modification of all wnts is palmitoleoylation of a single totally conserved serine residue. palmitoleoylation is necessary because it is required for wnt to bind to its carrier protein wntless (wls) so it can be transported to the plasma membrane for secretion and it allows the wnt protein to bind its receptor frizzled  wnt proteins also undergo glycosylation, which attaches a carbohydrate in order to ensure proper secretion. in wnt signaling, these proteins act as ligands to activate the different wnt pathways via paracrine and autocrine routes.these proteins are highly conserved across species. they can be found in mice, humans, xenopus, zebrafish, drosophila and many others.


== mechanism ==


=== foundation ===
wnt signaling begins when a wnt protein binds to the n-terminal extra-cellular cysteine-rich domain of a frizzled (fz) family receptor. these receptors span the plasma membrane seven times and constitute a distinct family of g-protein coupled receptors (gpcrs). however, to facilitate wnt signaling, co-receptors may be required alongside the interaction between the wnt protein and fz receptor. examples include lipoprotein receptor-related protein (lrp)-5/6, receptor tyrosine kinase (rtk), and ror2. upon activation of the receptor, a signal is sent to the phosphoprotein dishevelled (dsh), which is located in the cytoplasm. this signal is transmitted via a direct interaction between fz and dsh. dsh proteins are present in all organisms and they all share the following highly conserved protein domains: an amino-terminal dix domain, a central pdz domain, and a carboxy-terminal dep domain. these different domains are important because after dsh, the wnt signal can branch off into multiple pathways and each pathway interacts with a different combination of the three domains.


=== canonical and noncanonical pathways ===
the three best characterized wnt signaling pathways are the canonical wnt pathway, the noncanonical planar cell polarity pathway, and the noncanonical wnt/calcium pathway. as their names suggest, these pathways belong to one of two categories: canonical or noncanonical. the difference between the categories is that a canonical pathway involves the protein β-catenin while a noncanonical pathway operates independently of it.


==== canonical pathway ====
the canonical wnt pathway (or wnt/β-catenin pathway) is the wnt pathway that causes an accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm and its eventual translocation into the nucleus to act as a transcriptional coactivator of transcription factors that belong to the tcf/lef family. without wnt, β-catenin would not accumulate in the cytoplasm since a destruction complex would normally degrade it. this destruction complex includes the following proteins: axin, adenomatosis polyposis coli (apc), protein phosphatase 2a (pp2a), glycogen synthase kinase 3 (gsk3) and casein kinase 1α (ck1α). it degrades β-catenin by targeting it for ubiquitination, which subsequently sends it to the proteasome to be digested. however, as soon as wnt binds fz and lrp5/6, the destruction complex function becomes disrupted. this is due to wnt causing the translocation of the negative wnt regulator, axin, and the destruction complex to the plasma membrane. phosphorylation by other proteins in the destruction complex subsequently binds axin to the cytoplasmic tail of lrp5/6. axin becomes de-phosphorylated and its stability and levels decrease. dsh then becomes activated via phosphorylation and its dix and pdz domains inhibit the gsk3 activity of the destruction complex. this allows β-catenin to accumulate and localize to the nucleus and subsequently induce a cellular response via gene transduction alongside the tcf/lef (t-cell factor/lymphoid enhancing factor) transcription factors. β-catenin recruits other transcriptional coactivators, such as bcl9, pygopus and parafibromin/hyrax. the complexity of the transcriptional complex assembled by β-catenin is beginning to emerge thanks to new high-throughput proteomics studies. however, a unified theory of how β‐catenin drives target gene expression is still missing, and tissue-specific players might assist β‐catenin to define its target genes. the extensivity of the β-catenin interacting proteins complicates our understanding: β-catenin may be directly phosphorylated at ser552 by akt, which causes its disassociation from cell-cell contacts and accumulation in cytosol, thereafter 14-3-3ζ interacts with β-catenin (pser552) and enhances its nuclear translocation. bcl9 and pygopus have been reported, in fact, to possess several β-catenin-independent functions (therefore, likely, wnt signaling-independent).


==== noncanonical pathways ====
the noncanonical planar cell polarity (pcp) pathway does not involve β-catenin. it does not use lrp-5/6 as its co-receptor and is thought to use nrh1, ryk, ptk7 or ror2. the pcp pathway is activated via the binding of wnt to fz and its co-receptor. the receptor then recruits dsh, which uses its pdz and dix domains to form a complex with dishevelled-associated activator of morphogenesis 1 (daam1). daam1 then activates the small g-protein rho through a guanine exchange factor. rho activates rho-associated kinase (rock), which is one of the major regulators of the cytoskeleton. dsh also forms a complex with rac1 and mediates profilin binding to actin. rac1 activates jnk and can also lead to actin polymerization. profilin binding to actin can result in restructuring of the cytoskeleton and gastrulation.

the noncanonical wnt/calcium pathway also does not involve β-catenin. its role is to help regulate calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum (er) in order to control intracellular calcium levels. like other wnt pathways, upon ligand binding, the activated fz receptor directly interacts with dsh and activates specific dsh-protein domains. the domains involved in wnt/calcium signaling are the pdz and dep domains. however, unlike other wnt pathways, the fz receptor directly interfaces with a trimeric g-protein. this co-stimulation of dsh and the g-protein can lead to the activation of either plc or cgmp-specific pde. if plc is activated, the plasma membrane component pip2 is cleaved into dag and ip3. when ip3 binds its receptor on the er, calcium is released. increased concentrations of calcium and dag can activate cdc42 through pkc. cdc42 is an important regulator of ventral patterning. increased calcium also activates calcineurin and camkii. camkii induces activation of the transcription factor nfat, which regulates cell adhesion, migration and tissue separation. calcineurin activates tak1 and nlk kinase, which can interfere with tcf/ß-catenin signaling in the canonical wnt pathway. however, if pde is activated, calcium release from the er is inhibited. pde mediates this through the inhibition of pkg, which subsequently causes the inhibition of calcium release.


=== integrated wnt pathway ===
the binary distinction of canonical and non-canonical wnt signaling pathways has come under scrutiny and an integrated, convergent wnt pathway has been proposed. some evidence for this was found for one wnt ligand (wnt5a). evidence for a convergent wnt signaling pathway that shows integrated activation of wnt/ca2+ and wnt/ß-catenin signaling, for multiple wnt ligands, was described in mammalian cell lines.


=== other pathways ===
wnt signaling also regulates a number of other signaling pathways that have not been as extensively elucidated. one such pathway includes the interaction between wnt and gsk3. during cell growth, wnt can inhibit gsk3 in order to activate mtor in the absence of β-catenin. however, wnt can also serve as a negative regulator of mtor via activation of the tumor suppressor tsc2, which is upregulated via dsh and gsk3 interaction. during myogenesis, wnt uses pa and creb to activate myod and myf5 genes. wnt also acts in conjunction with ryk and src to allow for regulation of neuron repulsion during axonal guidance. wnt regulates gastrulation when ck1 serves as an inhibitor of rap1-atpase in order to modulate the cytoskeleton during gastrulation. further regulation of gastrulation is achieved when wnt uses ror2 along with the cdc42 and jnk pathway to regulate the expression of papc. dsh can also interact with apkc, pa3, par6 and lgl in order to control cell polarity and microtubule cytoskeleton development. while these pathways overlap with components associated with pcp and wnt/calcium signaling, they are considered distinct pathways because they produce different responses.


=== regulation ===
in order to ensure proper functioning, wnt signaling is constantly regulated at several points along its signaling pathways. for example, wnt proteins are palmitoylated. the protein porcupine mediates this process, which means that it helps regulate when the wnt ligand is secreted by determining when it is fully formed. secretion is further controlled with proteins such as gpr177 (wntless) and evenness interrupted and complexes such as the retromer complex.upon secretion, the ligand can be prevented from reaching its receptor through the binding of proteins such as the stabilizers dally and glypican 3 (gpc3), which inhibit diffusion. in cancer cells, both the heparan sulfate chains and the core protein of gpc3 are involved in regulating wnt binding and activation for cell proliferation. wnt recognizes a heparan sulfate structure on gpc3, which contains idoa2s and glcns6s, and the 3-o-sulfation in glcns6s3s enhances the binding of wnt to the heparan sulfate glypican. a cysteine-rich domain at the n-lobe of gpc3 has been identified to form a wnt-binding hydrophobic groove including phenylalanine-41 that interacts with wnt. blocking the wnt binding domain using a nanobody called hn3 can inhibit wnt activation.at the fz receptor, the binding of proteins other than wnt can antagonize signaling. specific antagonists include dickkopf (dkk), wnt inhibitory factor 1 (wif-1), secreted frizzled-related proteins (sfrp), cerberus, frzb, wise, sost, and naked cuticle. these constitute inhibitors of wnt signaling. however, other molecules also act as activators. norrin and r-spondin2 activate wnt signaling in the absence of wnt ligand.
interactions between wnt signaling pathways also regulate wnt signaling. as previously mentioned, the wnt/calcium pathway can inhibit tcf/β-catenin, preventing canonical wnt pathway signaling. prostaglandin e2 is an essential activator of the canonical wnt signaling pathway. interaction of pge2 with its receptors e2/e4 stabilizes β-catenin through camp/pka mediated phosphorylation. the synthesis of pge2 is necessary for wnt signaling mediated processes such as tissue regeneration and control of stem cell population in zebrafish and mouse. intriguingly, the unstructured regions of several oversized intrinsically disordered proteins play crucial roles in regulating wnt signaling.


== induced cell responses ==


=== embryonic development ===
wnt signaling plays a critical role in embryonic development. it operates in both vertebrates and invertebrates, including humans, frogs, zebrafish, c. elegans, drosophila and others. it was first found in the segment polarity of drosophila, where it helps to establish anterior and posterior polarities. it is implicated in other developmental processes. as its function in drosophila suggests, it plays a key role in body axis formation, particularly the formation of the anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes. it is involved in the induction of cell differentiation to prompt formation of important organs such as lungs and ovaries. wnt further ensures the development of these tissues through proper regulation of cell proliferation and migration. wnt signaling functions can be divided into axis patterning, cell fate specification, cell proliferation and cell migration.


==== axis patterning ====
in early embryo development, the formation of the primary body axes is a crucial step in establishing the organism's overall body plan. the axes include the anteroposterior axis, dorsoventral axis, and right-left axis. wnt signaling is implicated in the formation of the anteroposterior and dorsoventral (dv) axes. wnt signaling activity in anterior-posterior development can be seen in mammals, fish and frogs. in mammals, the primitive streak and other surrounding tissues produce the morphogenic compounds wnts, bmps, fgfs, nodal and retinoic acid to establish the posterior region during late gastrula. these proteins form concentration gradients. areas of highest concentration establish the posterior region while areas of lowest concentration indicate the anterior region. in fish and frogs, β-catenin produced by canonical wnt signaling causes the formation of organizing centers, which, alongside bmps, elicit posterior formation. wnt involvement in dv axis formation can be seen in the activity of the formation of the spemann organizer, which establishes the dorsal region. canonical wnt signaling β-catenin production induces the formation of this organizer via the activation of the genes twin and siamois. similarly, in avian gastrulation, cells of the koller's sickle express different mesodermal marker genes that allow for the differential movement of cells during the formation of the primitive streak. wnt signaling activated by fgfs is responsible for this movement.wnt signaling is also involved in the axis formation of specific body parts and organ systems later in development. in vertebrates, sonic hedgehog (shh) and wnt morphogenetic signaling gradients establish the dorsoventral axis of the central nervous system during neural tube axial patterning. high wnt signaling establishes the dorsal region while high shh signaling indicates the ventral region. wnt is involved in the dv formation of the central nervous system through its involvement in axon guidance. wnt proteins guide the axons of the spinal cord in an anterior-posterior direction. wnt is also involved in the formation of the limb dv axis. specifically, wnt7a helps produce the dorsal patterning of the developing limb.in the embryonic differentiation waves model of development wnt plays a critical role as part a signalling complex in competent cells ready to differentiate. wnt reacts to the activity of the cytoskeleton, stabilizing the initial change created by a passing wave of contraction or expansion and simultaneously signals the nucleus through the use of its different signalling pathways as to which wave the individual cell has participated in. wnt activity thereby amplifies mechanical signalling that occurs during development.


==== cell fate specification ====
cell fate specification or cell differentiation is a process where undifferentiated cells can become a more specialized cell type. wnt signaling induces differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into mesoderm and endoderm progenitor cells. these progenitor cells further differentiate into cell types such as endothelial, cardiac and vascular smooth muscle lineages. wnt signaling induces blood formation from stem cells. specifically, wnt3 leads to mesoderm committed cells with hematopoietic potential. wnt1 antagonizes neural differentiation and is a major factor in self-renewal of neural stem cells. this allows for regeneration of nervous system cells, which is further evidence of a role in promoting neural stem cell proliferation. wnt signaling is involved in germ cell determination, gut tissue specification, hair follicle development, lung tissue development, trunk neural crest cell differentiation, nephron development, ovary development and sex determination. wnt signaling also antagonizes heart formation, and wnt inhibition was shown to be a critical inducer of heart tissue during development, and small molecule wnt inhibitors are routinely used to produce cardiomyocytes from pluripotent stem cells.


==== cell proliferation ====
in order to have the mass differentiation of cells needed to form the specified cell tissues of different organisms, proliferation and growth of embryonic stem cells must take place. this process is mediated through canonical wnt signaling, which increases nuclear and cytoplasmic β-catenin. increased β-catenin can initiate transcriptional activation of proteins such as cyclin d1 and c-myc, which control the g1 to s phase transition in the cell cycle. entry into the s phase causes dna replication and ultimately mitosis, which are responsible for cell proliferation. this proliferation increase is directly paired with cell differentiation because as the stem cells proliferate, they also differentiate. this allows for overall growth and development of specific tissue systems during embryonic development. this is apparent in systems such as the circulatory system where wnt3a leads to proliferation and expansion of hematopoietic stem cells needed for red blood cell formation.the biochemistry of cancer stem cells is subtly different than that of other tumor cells. these so-called wnt-addicted cells hijack and depend on constant stimulation of the wnt pathway to promote their uncontrolled growth, survival and migration. in cancer, wnt signaling can become independent of regular stimuli, through mutations in downstream oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes that become permanently activated even though the normal receptor has not received a signal. β-catenin binds to transcription factors such as the protein tcf4 and in combination the molecules activate the necessary genes. lf3 strongly inhibits this binding in vitro, in cell lines and reduced tumor growth in mouse models. it prevented replication and reduced their ability to migrate, all without affecting healthy cells. no cancer stem cells remained after treatment. the discovery was the product of ""rational drug design"", involving alphascreens and elisa technologies.


==== cell migration ====

cell migration during embryonic development allows for the establishment of body axes, tissue formation, limb induction and several other processes. wnt signaling helps mediate this process, particularly during convergent extension. signaling from both the wnt pcp pathway and canonical wnt pathway is required for proper convergent extension during gastrulation. convergent extension is further regulated by the wnt/calcium pathway, which blocks convergent extension when activated. wnt signaling also induces cell migration in later stages of development through the control of the migration behavior of neuroblasts, neural crest cells, myocytes, and tracheal cells.wnt signaling is involved in another key migration process known as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (emt). this process allows epithelial cells to transform into mesenchymal cells so that they are no longer held in place at the laminin. it involves cadherin down-regulation so that cells can detach from laminin and migrate. wnt signaling is an inducer of emt, particularly in mammary development.


=== insulin sensitivity ===

insulin is a peptide hormone involved in glucose homeostasis within certain organisms. specifically, it leads to upregulation of glucose transporters in the cell membrane in order to increase glucose uptake from the bloodstream. this process is partially mediated by activation of wnt/β-catenin signaling, which can increase a cell's insulin sensitivity. in particular, wnt10b is a wnt protein that increases this sensitivity in skeletal muscle cells.


== clinical implications ==


=== cancer ===
since its initial discovery, wnt signaling has had an association with cancer. when wnt1 was discovered, it was first identified as a proto-oncogene in a mouse model for breast cancer. the fact that wnt1 is a homolog of wg shows that it is involved in embryonic development, which often calls for rapid cell division and migration. misregulation of these processes can lead to tumor development via excess cell proliferation.canonical wnt pathway activity is involved in the development of benign and malignant breast tumors. the role of wnt pathway in tumor chemoresistance has been also well documented, as well as its role in the maintenance of a distinct subpopulation of cancer-initiating cells. its presence is revealed by elevated levels of β-catenin in the nucleus and/or cytoplasm, which can be detected with immunohistochemical staining and western blotting. increased β-catenin expression is correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. this accumulation may be due to factors such as mutations in β-catenin, deficiencies in the β-catenin destruction complex, most frequently by mutations in structurally disordered regions of apc, overexpression of wnt ligands, loss of inhibitors and/or decreased activity of regulatory pathways (such as the wnt/calcium pathway). breast tumors can metastasize due to wnt involvement in emt. research looking at metastasis of basal-like breast cancer to the lungs showed that repression of wnt/β-catenin signaling can prevent emt, which can inhibit metastasis.wnt signaling has been implicated in the development of other cancers. changes in ctnnb1 expression, which is the gene that encodes β-catenin, can be measured in breast, colorectal, melanoma, prostate, lung, and other cancers. increased expression of wnt ligand-proteins such as wnt1, wnt2 and wnt7a were observed in the development of glioblastoma, oesophageal cancer and ovarian cancer respectively. other proteins that cause multiple cancer types in the absence of proper functioning include ror1, ror2, sfrp4, wnt5a, wif1 and those of the tcf/lef family.the link between pge2 and wnt suggests that a chronic inflammation-related increase of pge2 may lead to activation of the wnt pathway in different tissues, resulting in carcinogenesis.


=== type ii diabetes ===
diabetes mellitus type 2 is a common disease that causes reduced insulin secretion and increased insulin resistance in the periphery. it results in increased blood glucose levels, or hyperglycemia, which can be fatal if untreated. since wnt signaling is involved in insulin sensitivity, malfunctioning of its pathway could be involved. overexpression of wnt5b, for instance, may increase susceptibility due to its role in adipogenesis, since obesity and type ii diabetes have high comorbidity. wnt signaling is a strong activator of mitochondrial biogenesis. this leads to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ros) known to cause dna and cellular damage. this ros-induced damage is significant because it can cause acute hepatic insulin resistance, or injury-induced insulin resistance. mutations in wnt signaling-associated transcription factors, such as tcf7l2, are linked to increased susceptibility.

mucous neck cell,cell,"foveolar cells or surface mucous cells are mucus-producing cells which cover the inside of the stomach, protecting it from the corrosive nature of gastric acid. these cells line the gastric mucosa (mucous neck cells are found in the necks of the gastric pits). the mucus-secreting cells of the stomach can be distinguished histologically from the intestinal goblet cells, another type of mucus-secreting cell.


== structure ==
the gastric mucosa that lines the inner wall of the stomach has a set of microscopic features called gastric glands which, depending on the location within the stomach, secrete different substances into the lumen of the organ. the openings of these glands into the stomach are called gastric pits which foveolar cells line in order to provide a protective alkaline secretion against the corrosive gastric acid.


=== microanatomy ===

foveolar cells line the surface of the stomach, the gastric pits, and the top part of gastric glands: the neck. they constitute a simple columnar epithelium, as they form a single layer of cells and are taller than their width. depending on their location, foveolar cells can be divided in two groups: surface mucous cells, which line the surface and the gastric pits; and mucous neck cells, which are a part of the neck of gastric glands along parietal cells.surface mucous cells have large quantities of mucin granules in their apical (top) surface and project short microvilli into the lumen of the stomach. mucins are large glycoproteins that give the mucus its gel-like properties. as mucins are lost during routine histology preparation, they stain pale, but if preserved correctly the cells stain strongly with special techniques like pas or toluidine blue, the last representing the anionic nature of foveolar cell secretions. below the mucin granules, surface mucous cells have a golgi apparatus, the nucleus, and small amounts of rough endoplasmic reticulum. mucous neck cells are located within gastric glands, interspersed between parietal cells. these are shorter than their surface counterpart and contain lesser quantities of mucin granules in their apical surface.


== function ==

the mucus produced by these cells is extremely important, as it prevents the stomach from digesting itself. parietal cells produce potent hydrochloric acid, which damages cells. gastric chief cells produce pepsinogen, which is activated by the acid to form pepsin. pepsin is a protease that can digest and damage stomach cells. to prevent these disastrous effects, mucus and bicarbonate ions (hco3−) are secreted by the foveolar cells.
the mucus allows the acid at ph above 4 to penetrate lining, but below ph 4 (i.e. when acid is more concentrated) the acid cannot penetrate the mucus. this is called viscous fingering. thus the foveolar cells can pump out a lot of acid, but acid once in the lumen of the stomach is prevented from returning.

sparfloxacin,antibiotic,"sparfloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic used in the treatment of bacterial infections. it has a controversial safety profile.it was patented in 1985 and approved for medical use in 1993. zagam is no longer available in the united states.


== medical uses ==
the compound is indicated for treating community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections (acute sinusitis, exacerbations of chronic bronchitis caused by susceptible bacteria, community-acquired pneumonia).


== adverse reactions ==

in a review of 2081 adult patients participating in a phase iii clinical trial of sparfloxacin in community-acquired, lower respiratory tract infections, sparfloxacin (200 or 400 mg loading dose then 100 or 200 mg daily; i.e. 200/100 mg and 400/200 mg) had a similar incidence of adverse events as the comparator agents (rubinstein, 1996). the overall rates of drug-related adverse reactions for sparfloxacin 400/200 mg versus comparators and 200/100 mg versus the comparator (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) were 13.7 versus 17.7%, and 9.5 versus 13.2%, respectively. however, many of these reported reactions were very minor; discontinua- tion of the antibacterial agent because of drug-related adverse reactions occurred in 1.6 versus 1.6%, and 1) versus 1.1%, respectively. adverse reactions affecting the nervous system were reported in 5.7% of the sparfloxacin group, with insomnia and other sleep disorders the most common events.
phototoxicity was noted in 2.0% of sparfloxacin recipients, with the average delay in onset being 6.3 :t 4.5 days (range 1–14 days) after commencing sparfloxacin. mostly this consisted of erythema on the face and hands which lasted an average of 6.4 :t 4.2 days. the incidence of phototoxicity associated with sparfloxacin appears to be higher than that observed with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin but less than that reported for fleroxacin, pefloxacin, enoxacin and nalidixic acid.
most importantly, features of the hemolytic-uremic syndrome such as that associated with temafloxacin have not been reported.


== pharmacological properties ==
sparfloxacin is about 37-45% bound to proteins in the blood.
sparfloxacin achieves a high degree of penetration into most tissues, except for the central nervous system.
following a single 400 mg oral dose of sparfloxacin, the mean peak concentration in cantharides-induced inflammatory fluid is 1.3 la-g per ml after a mean duration of 5 h post-dose. thus, overall sparfloxacin penetration into inflammatory fluid is 117% and the mean elimination half-life from this fluid is 19.7 h.
skin penetration of sparfloxacin is good with skin:plasma ratios of 1.00 at 4 h (time of peak plasma concentration) and 1.39 at 5 h. following single oral doses of 100 or 200 mg, concentrations in skin of 0.56 and 0.82–1.31 la-g per g, respectively, can be expected. sparfloxacin achieves excellent penetration into human polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vitro.
sparfloxacin achieves high concentrations in respiratory and sinus tissues. following an oral loading dose of 400 mg followed by 200 mg daily, mean concentrations of sparfloxacin (2.5 to 5 h after dosing) in bronchial mucosa, epithelial lining fluid and alveolar macrophages are 4.4 µg/g, 15.0 µg/ml and 53.7 µg/g, respectively. the mean sparfloxacin concentration in maxillary sinus mucosa, 2–5 h after a single 400 mg dose, is 5.8 µg/g.shimada et al. ( 1993) has summarized many of the studies published in japanese regarding the tissue distribution of sparfloxacin. (high concentrations are achieved in sputum, pleural fluid, skin, lung, prostate, gynecological tissues, breast milk and otolaryngological tissues. *salivary concentrations are 66 to 70% of plasma levels, while csf penetration appears to be somewhat limited with csf:plasma concentration ratios of only 0.25 to 0.35.

sparfloxacin achieves concentrations in bile and gallbladder of 7.1- to 83-fold the concurrent serum levels.in rabbits, sparfloxacin achieves very good penetration into the ocular vitreous (54%), cornea (76%) and lens (36%).


== mechanism of action ==
sparfloxacin, like other quinolones and fluoroquinolones, are bactericidal drugs, actively killing bacteria. quinolones inhibit the bacterial dna gyrase or the topoisomerase iv enzyme, thereby inhibiting dna replication and transcription. quinolones can enter cells easily and therefore are often used to treat intracellular pathogens such as legionella pneumophila and mycoplasma pneumoniae. for many gram-negative bacteria dna gyrase is the target, whereas topoisomerase iv is the target for many gram-positive bacteria. eukaryotic cells do not contain dna gyrase or topoisomerase iv.

protein abhd12b isoform h2 (human),protein,"cannabinoid receptor type 1 (cb1), also known as cannabinoid receptor 1, is a g protein-coupled cannabinoid receptor that in humans is encoded by the cnr1 gene. the human cb1 receptor is expressed in the peripheral nervous system and central nervous system. it is activated by: endocannabinoids, a group of retrograde neurotransmitters that include anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-ag); plant phytocannabinoids, such as the compound thc which is an active ingredient of the psychoactive drug cannabis; and, synthetic analogs of thc. cb1 is antagonized by the phytocannabinoid tetrahydrocannabivarin (thcv).the primary endogenous agonist of the human cb1 receptor is anandamide.


== structure ==
the cb1 receptor shares the structure characteristic of all g-protein-coupled receptors, possessing seven transmembrane domains connected by three extracellular and three intracellular loops, an extracellular n-terminal tail, and an intracellular c-terminal tail. the receptor may exist as a homodimer or form heterodimers or other gpcr oligomers with different classes of g-protein-coupled receptors. observed heterodimers include a2a–cb1, cb1–d2, ox1–cb1, while many more may only be stable enough to exist in vivo. the cb1 receptor possesses an allosteric modulatory binding site.


== mechanism ==
the cb1 receptor is a pre-synaptic heteroreceptor that modulates neurotransmitter release when activated in a dose-dependent, stereoselective and pertussis toxin-sensitive manner. the cb1 receptor is activated by cannabinoids, generated naturally inside the body (endocannabinoids) or introduced into the body as cannabis or a related synthetic compound.
research suggests that the majority of cb1 receptors are coupled through gi/o proteins. upon activation, cb1 receptor exhibits its effects mainly through activation of gi, which decreases intracellular camp concentration by inhibiting its production enzyme, adenylate cyclase, and increases mitogen-activated protein kinase (map kinase) concentration. alternatively, in some rare cases cb1 receptor activation may be coupled to gs proteins, which stimulate adenylate cyclase. camp is known to serve as a second messenger coupled to a variety of ion channels, including the positively influenced inwardly rectifying potassium channels (=kir or irk), and calcium channels, which are activated by camp-dependent interaction with such molecules as protein kinase a (pka), protein kinase c (pkc), raf-1, erk, jnk, p38, c-fos, c-jun, and others.in terms of function, the inhibition of intracellular camp expression shortens the duration of pre-synaptic action potentials by  prolonging the rectifying potassium a-type currents, which is normally inactivated upon phosphorylation by pka. this inhibition grows more pronounced when considered with the effect of activated cb1 receptors to limit calcium entry into the cell, which does not occur through camp but by a direct g-protein-mediated inhibition. as presynaptic calcium entry is a requirement for vesicle release, this function will decrease the transmitter that enters the synapse upon release. the relative contribution of each of these two inhibitory mechanisms depends on the variance of ion channel expression by cell type.
the cb1 receptor can also be allosterically modulated by synthetic ligands  in a positive and negative manner. in vivo exposure to thc impairs long-term potentiation and leads to a reduction of phosphorylated creb.in summary, cb1 receptor activity has been found to be coupled to certain ion channels, in the following manner:
positively to inwardly rectifying and a-type outward potassium channels.
negatively to d-type outward potassium channels
negatively to n-type and p/q-type calcium channels.


== expression ==
the cb1 receptor is encoded by the gene cnr1, located on human chromosome 6. two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene. cnr1 orthologs have been identified in most mammals.
the cb1 receptor is expressed pre-synaptically at both glutaminergic and gabaergic interneurons and, in effect, acts as a neuromodulator to inhibit release of glutamate and gaba. repeated administration of receptor agonists may result in receptor internalization and/or a reduction in receptor protein signalling.the inverse agonist mk-9470 makes it possible to produce in vivo images of the distribution of cb1 receptors in the human brain with positron emission tomography.


=== brain ===

cb1 receptors are expressed most densely in the central nervous system and are largely responsible for mediating the effects of cannabinoid binding in the brain. endocannabinoids released by a depolarized neuron bind to cb1 receptors on pre-synaptic glutamatergic and gabaergic neurons, resulting in a respective decrease in either glutamate or gaba release. limiting glutamate release causes reduced excitation, while limiting gaba release suppresses inhibition, a common form of short-term plasticity in which the depolarization of a single neuron induces a reduction in gaba-mediated inhibition, in effect exciting the postsynaptic cell.varying levels of cb1 expression can be detected in the olfactory bulb, cortical regions (neocortex, pyriform cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala), several parts of basal ganglia, thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei, and other subcortical regions (e.g., the septal region), cerebellar cortex, and brainstem nuclei (e.g., the periaqueductal gray).


==== hippocampal formation ====
cb1 mrna transcripts are abundant in gabaergic interneurons of the hippocampus, indirectly reflecting the expression of these receptors and elucidating the established effect of cannabinoids on memory. these receptors are densely located in cornu ammonis pyramidal cells, which are known to release glutamate. cannabinoids suppress the induction of ltp and ltd in the hippocampus by inhibiting these glutamatergic neurons. by reducing the concentration of glutamate released below the threshold necessary to depolarize the postsynaptic receptor nmda, a receptor known to be directly related to the induction of ltp and ltd, cannabinoids are a crucial factor in the selectivity of memory.
these receptors are highly expressed by gabaergic interneurons as well as glutamatergic principal neurons. however, a higher density is found within gabaergic cells. this means that, although synaptic strength/frequency, and thus potential to induce ltp, is lowered, net hippocampal activity is raised. in addition, cb1 receptors in the hippocampus indirectly inhibit the release of acetylcholine. this serves as the modulatory axis opposing gaba, decreasing neurotransmitter release. cannabinoids also likely play an important role in the development of memory through their neonatal promotion of myelin formation, and thus the individual segregation of axons.


==== basal ganglia ====
cb1 receptors are expressed throughout the basal ganglia and have well-established effects on movement in rodents. as in the hippocampus, these receptors inhibit the release of glutamate or gaba transmitter, resulting in decreased excitation or reduced inhibition based on the cell they are expressed in. consistent with the variable expression of both excitatory glutamate and inhibitory gaba interneurons in both the basal ganglia's direct and indirect motor loops, synthetic cannabinoids are known to influence this system in a dose-dependent triphasic pattern. decreased locomotor activity is seen at both higher and lower concentrations of applied cannabinoids, whereas an enhancement of movement may occur upon moderate dosages. however, these dose-dependent effects have been studied predominately in rodents, and the physiological basis for this triphasic pattern warrants future research in humans. effects may vary based on the site of cannabinoid application, input from higher cortical centers, and whether drug application is unilateral or bilateral.


==== cerebellum and neocortex ====
the role of the cb1 receptor in the regulation of motor movements is complicated by the additional expression of this receptor in the cerebellum and neocortex, two regions associated with the coordination and initiation of movement. research suggests that anandamide is synthesized by purkinje cells and acts on presynaptic receptors to inhibit glutamate release from granule cells or gaba release from the terminals of basket cells. in the neocortex, these receptors are concentrated on local interneurons in cerebral layers ii-iii and v-vi. compared to rat brains, humans express more cb1 receptors in the cerebral cortex and amygdala and less in the cerebellum, which may help explain why motor function seems to be more compromised in rats than humans upon cannabinoid application.


=== spine ===
many of the documented analgesic effects of cannabinoids are based on the interaction of these compounds with cb1 receptors on spinal cord interneurons in the superficial levels of the dorsal horn, known for its role in nociceptive processing. in particular, the cb1 is heavily expressed in layers 1 and 2 of the spinal cord dorsal horn and in lamina 10 by the central canal. dorsal root ganglion also express these receptors, which target a variety of peripheral terminals involved in nociception. signals on this track are also transmitted to the periaqueductal gray (pag) of the midbrain. endogenous cannabinoids are believed to exhibit an analgesic effect on these receptors by limiting both gaba and glutamate of pag cells that relate to nociceptive input processing, a hypothesis consistent with the finding that anandamide release in the pag is increased in response to pain-triggering stimuli.


=== other ===
cb1 is expressed on several types of cell in pituitary gland, thyroid gland, and possibly in the adrenal gland. cb1 is also expressed in several cells relating to metabolism, such as fat cells, muscle cells, liver cells (and also in the endothelial cells, kupffer cells and stellate cells of the liver), and in the digestive tract. it is also expressed in the lungs and the kidney.
cb1 is present on leydig cells and human sperms. in females, it is present in the ovaries, oviducts myometrium, decidua, and placenta. it has also been implicated in the proper development of the embryo.cb1 is also expressed in the retina. in the retina, they are expressed in the photoreceptors, inner plexiform, outer plexiform, bipolar cells, ganglion cells, and retinal pigment epithelium cells. in the visual system, cannabinoids agonist induce a dose dependent modulation of calcium, chloride and potassium channels. this alters vertical transmission between photoreceptor, bipolar and ganglion cells. altering vertical transmission in turn results in the way vision is perceived.


== use of antagonists ==
selective cb1 agonists may be used to isolate the effects of the receptor from the cb2 receptor, as most cannabinoids and endocannabinoids bind to both receptor types.cb1 selective antagonists are used for weight reduction and smoking cessation (see rimonabant). a substantial number of antagonists of the cb1 receptor have been discovered and characterized. tm38837 has been developed as a cb1 receptor antagonist that is restricted to targeting only peripheral cb1 receptors.

the flattened, ovoid body of cheloniellid comprises an eye-bearing cephalon (head) and segmented trunk region, dorsally divided by a series of tergites (dorsal exoskeleton). the cephalon could be divided into procephalon and gnathocephalon. compared to other members of artiopoda, the head shield (dorsal exoskeleton of cephalon) of cheloniellid is relatively reduced. the trunk is wider than the cephalon and is made up of 8-13 tergites. the pleural (lateral) tips of first few tergites are directed anterolaterally, becoming increasingly posterolaterally directed rearward, giving the segmental boundaries between tergites a radiated appearance. the last trunk segment, also known as postabdomen,  is tiny and laterally encompassed by the pleural regions of previous tergite.

		
based on available materials, the cephalon comprises a pair of antennae and 5 pairs of uniramus appendages, with the posterior 4 pairs bore gnathobases. there are evidences that the non-gnathobasic second cephalic appendages are specialized or even raptorial in some species. each of the trunk segments (except the last one) has a pair of biramous appendages each consisting of a leg-like endopod and a shorter exopod. the last trunk segment has a pair of spine/whip-like appendages referred as furcae or cerci, some species bore a medial spine between it which may or may not be a telson.


== classification ==


=== phylogenetic position ===

while boudreaux (1979) regarded cheloniellida as a class, further studies usually treat cheloniellida as an order. cheloniellida has a controversial phylogenetic position within arthropod higher classifications, with studies mainly around 20th century suggested it as a relative/member of either crustacea, trilobita, chelicerata or aglaspidida. some species even had been misidentified as polyplacophoran mollusks (chiton) when being first described. originally, the iconic cheloniellid cheloniellon was believed to be a crustacean similar to trilobites. subsequent authors suggests that it occupied a position intermediate between trilobitomorphs and chelicerates, while some also interpreted it as a sister group of crustaceans or chelicerates as well. the suggested close relationship between cheloniellids and chelicerates was inferred by the gnathobasic appendages similar to those of merostomes (e.g. xiphosurans and eurypterids), and the hypothesis that the chelicerates arose from trilobitomorphs through the loss of deutocerebral antennae (i.e. first antennae) and specialization of tritocerebral appendages into chelicerae (comparable to the cheloniellid antennae and specialized 2nd appendages), a scenario which is not supported by gene expression, neuroanatomical and developmental evidences (suggests that chelicerae are in fact deutocerebral). 

as of 21st century, cheloniellida was mostly found to form a clade with aglaspidida and xenopoda (e.g. sidneyia and emeraldella). the clade was formally named vicissicaudata in 2013, united by a differentiated terminal trunk area (postabdomen) that bears a pair of non-leg-like appendages. numerous phylogenetic analyses also retrieved vicissicaudata within artiopoda, a diverse arthropod taxon comprising trilobites and similar fossil taxa that may or may not be closely related to chelicerates.

ran-binding protein 6 (mouse),protein,"ran (ras-related nuclear protein) also known as gtp-binding nuclear protein ran is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ran gene. ran is a small 25 kda protein that is involved in transport into and out of the cell nucleus during interphase and also involved in mitosis. it is a member of the ras superfamily.ran is a small g protein that is essential for the translocation of rna and proteins through the nuclear pore complex. the ran protein has also been implicated in the control of dna synthesis and cell cycle progression, as mutations in ran have been found to disrupt dna synthesis.


== function ==


=== ran cycle ===

ran exists in the cell in two nucleotide-bound forms: gdp-bound and gtp-bound. rangdp is converted into rangtp through the action of rcc1, the nucleotide exchange factor for ran. rcc1 is also known as rangef (ran guanine nucleotide exchange factor). ran's intrinsic gtpase-activity is activated through interaction with ran gtpase activating protein (rangap), facilitated by complex formation with ran-binding protein (ranbp). gtpase-activation leads to the conversion of rangtp to rangdp, thus closing the ran cycle.
ran can diffuse freely within the cell, but because rcc1 and rangap are located in different places in the cell, the concentration of rangtp and rangdp differs locally as well, creating concentration gradients that act as signals for other cellular processes. rcc1 is bound to chromatin and therefore located inside the nucleus. rangap is cytoplasmic in yeast and bound to the nuclear envelope in plants and animals. in mammalian cells, it is sumo modified and attached to the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex via interaction with the nucleoporin ranbp2 (nup358). this difference in location of the accessory proteins in the ran cycle leads to a high rangtp to rangdp ratio inside the nucleus and an inversely low rangtp to rangdp ratio outside the nucleus.  in addition to a gradient of the nucleotide bound state of ran, there is a gradient of the protein itself, with a higher concentration of ran in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm.  cytoplasmic rangdp is imported into the nucleus by the small protein nutf2 (nuclear transport factor 2), where rcc1 can then catalyze exchange of gdp for gtp on ran.


=== role in nuclear transport during interphase ===

ran is involved in the transport of proteins across the nuclear envelope by interacting with karyopherins and changing their ability to bind or release cargo molecules. cargo proteins containing a nuclear localization signal (nls) are bound by importins and transported into the nucleus. inside the nucleus, rangtp binds to importin and releases the import cargo. cargo that needs to get out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm binds to exportin in a ternary complex with rangtp. upon hydrolysis of rangtp to rangdp outside the nucleus, the complex dissociates and export cargo is released.


=== role in mitosis ===
during mitosis, the ran cycle is involved in mitotic spindle assembly and nuclear envelope reassembly after the chromosomes have been separated. during prophase, the steep gradient in rangtp-rangdp ratio at the nuclear pores breaks down as the nuclear envelope becomes leaky and disassembles. rangtp concentration stays high around the chromosomes as rcc1, a nucleotide exchange factor, stays attached to chromatin. ranbp2 (nup358) and rangap move to the kinetochores where they facilitate the attachment of spindle fibers to chromosomes. moreover, rangtp promotes spindle assembly by mechanisms similar to mechanisms of nuclear transport: the activity of spindle assembly factors such as numa and tpx2 is inhibited by the binding to importins. by releasing importins, rangtp  activates these factors and therefore promotes the assembly of the mitotic spindle. in telophase, rangtp hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange are required for vesicle fusion at the reforming nuclear envelopes of the daughter nuclei.


=== ran and the androgen receptor ===
ran is an androgen receptor (ar) coactivator (ara24) that binds differentially with different lengths of polyglutamine within the androgen receptor. polyglutamine repeat expansion in the ar is linked to spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (kennedy's disease). ran coactivation of the ar diminishes with polyglutamine expansion within the ar, and this weak coactivation may lead to partial androgen insensitivity during the development of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.


== interactions ==
ran has been shown to interact with:

"delhi, wisconsin",non_science,"delhi, wisconsin is a ghost town in the town of rushford, winnebago county, wisconsin, united states. it is located on county highway e between omro and eureka at the junction of the fox river and waukau creek.  delhi was also known as la borde's landing. 1980 census records identify delhi as island park. delhi had an established post office between 1850-1893.


== history ==
delhi was founded by luke la borde, a french canadian trader. la borde patented the site of 145 acres on march 1, 1848. the site was expanded after the sale of initial lots. a land survey was made on july 17, 1849. the lots were uniform in measurement, 66 feet wide by 132 feet deep. the main street of broadway measured 82 1/2 feet wide. all other streets were 66 feet wide.  water, union, washington, liberty, grand, ann, broad, harrison, howard, pearl, main, and menominee streets are listed in a winnebago county platbook dated 1889.the site was used by regional indians as a burial ground. the settlers of delhi often found the indian burials while spring plowing. their findings included pottery, beads, guns, copper, and other objects. oshkosh public museum owns many of the relics.
delhi was a preferred trading post for the local indians and residents of eureka and omro. la borde built a float bridge for the use of poygan, winneconne, and rushford settlers on their way to the gristmills at waukau. in addition to being a trading post, delhi had 3 stores, 2 grain mills, 3 hop mills and hop press, and a saw mill. boats and furniture were crafted in delhi. it had a livery, a schoolhouse, a 22 room hotel, and a bar. the hops were grown and pressed in delhi then shipped to oshkosh and milwaukee. years later, a dock was built. steamboats made regular stops in delhi. a small stagecoach from oshkosh to omro, eureka, and other locations stopped daily in delhi delivering passengers and mail.
delhi was slowly abandoned and then deteriorated. it had considered itself to be a strong contender for county seat over omro and eureka. trade shifted to omro and eureka when those villages built better bridges than delhi could afford. the railroad came to omro causing further diversion of trade. delhi's residents moved to the neighboring villages and beyond.
today, only one deteriorated house stands from that era. luke la borde and his wife, louisa, are buried on the property.

4-diphosphocytidyl-2-c-methyl-d-erythritol kinase (escherichia coli k-12),protein,"the non-mevalonate pathway—also appearing as the mevalonate-independent pathway and the 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (mep/doxp) pathway—is an alternative metabolic pathway for the biosynthesis of the isoprenoid precursors isopentenyl pyrophosphate (ipp) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (dmapp). the currently preferred name for this pathway is the mep pathway, since mep is the first committed metabolite on the route to ipp.


== isoprenoid precursor biosynthesis ==
the classical mevalonate pathway or hmg-coa reductase pathway is a metabolic pathway from the biosynthesis of isoprenoid precursors present in most higher eukaryotes and some bacteria. it is important for the production of ipp and dmapp, which serve as the basis for the biosynthesis of isoprenoid (terpenoid) molecules used in processes as diverse as protein prenylation, cell membrane maintenance, the synthesis of hormones, protein anchoring and n-glycosylation.bacteria, plants, and apicomplexan protozoa—such as malaria parasites—are able to produce isoprenoid precursors using an alternative pathway, the mep pathway, which is a non-mevalonate pathway. in the case of plants and certain protozoa, the biosynthesis of ipp/dmapp takes place in plastid organelles. plants synthesise isoprenoid precursors using the mevalonate pathway in the cytoplasm and using the mep pathway in their chloroplasts. bacteria such as the model organism escherichia coli have been engineered for co-expressing both the mep and the mevalonate pathway. distribution of the metabolic fluxes between the mep and the mevalonate pathway can be studied using 13c-glucose isotopomers. bacteria that use the mep pathway include important pathogens such mycobacterium tuberculosis.


== reactions ==
the reactions of the non-mevalonate pathway are as follows, taken primarily from eisenreich and co-workers, except where the bold labels are additional local abbreviations to assist in connecting the table to the scheme above:


== inhibition and other pathway research ==
dxp reductoisomerase (also known as: dxr, doxp reductoisomerase, ispc, mep synthase), is a key enzyme in the mep pathway. it can be inhibited by the natural product 
fosmidomycin, which is under study as a starting point to develop a candidate antibacterial or antimalarial drug.the intermediate, hmb-pp, is a natural activator of human vγ9/vδ2 t cells, the major γδ t cell population in peripheral blood, and cells that ""play a crucial role in the immune response to microbial pathogens"".
isph inhibitors: non-mevalonate metabolic pathway that is essential for most bacteria but absent in humans, making it an ideal target for antibiotic development. this pathway, called methyl-d-erythritol phosphate (mep) or non-mevalonate pathway, is responsible for biosynthesis of isoprenoids—molecules required for cell survival in most pathogenic bacteria and hence will be helpful in most usually antibacterial resistant bacteria

endothelial cell of venule,cell,"high endothelial venules (hev) are specialized post-capillary venous swellings characterized by plump endothelial cells as opposed to the usual thinner endothelial cells found in regular venules.  hevs enable lymphocytes circulating in the blood to directly enter a lymph node (by crossing through the hev).in humans, hevs are found in all secondary lymphoid organs (with the exception of spleen, where blood exits through open arterioles and enters the red pulp), including hundreds of lymph nodes dispersed in the body, tonsils and adenoids in the pharynx, peyer's patches (pis) in the small intestine, appendix, and small aggregates of lymphoid tissue in the stomach and large intestine. in contrast to the endothelial cells from other vessels, the high endothelial cells of hevs have a distinctive appearance, consisting of a cuboidal morphology and with various receptors to interact with leukocytes (express specialized ligands for lymphocytes and are able to support high levels of lymphocyte extravasation). hevs enable naïve lymphocytes to move in and out of the lymph nodes from the circulatory system.  hev cells express addressins, which are specific adhesion molecules that attach to the l-selectins on lymphocytes and anchor them to the hev wall in preparation for crossing the endothelium.
the endothelial cells of hevs have a 'plump' appearance different from the flat morphology of endothelial cells that line other vessels, and are therefore called high endothelial cells by reference to their thickness.  another characteristic of hevs, revealed by light-microscopic examination, is the presence of a large number of lymphocytes within their walls. this illustrates the function of hevs in lymphocyte recruitment, and explains why these vessels were implicated in lymphocyte traffic from the time of their initial description.


== the need for hev ==
in order for an adaptive immune response to occur t cells need to be activated. t cells become activated by recognising foreign antigens bound to antigen presenting cells (apc), in particular, dendritic cells. in order for naïve t cells to bind to their specific antigen, they need to experience physical contact with those cells.  since antigen levels are usually low, contact in blood circulation would be unlikely. therefore, t cells need a region where they can go to sample foreign antigens that have entered the body. when an apc, such as a dendritic cell, binds a foreign antigen it becomes activated and moves into the lymph nodes (sites for antigen sampling by t cells) via afferent lymphatic vessels. naïve t cells in the circulation regularly move through the lymph nodes via hev in order to scan the apc for foreign antigens. when they encounter such an antigen, the cell becomes activated, resulting in the immune system mounting a response against the causative agent of the infection.
depletion of cd11c+ dendritic cells in mouse significantly altered the phenotype of hev. the normal phenotype of hev is possibly maintained by dc-secreted lymphotoxin (tnf-beta).


== cell movement through hev ==
hev cuboidal endothelial cells express the adhesion molecules glycam-1 (in mucosal hev this is madcam-1), icam-1 and cd34. they also secrete the chemokine ccl21. naïve t cells express ccr7 receptor and adhesion molecules l-selectin and lfa-1. as naïve t cells move through the circulation, they 'roll' over the endothelial cells in the vessel walls. the rolling mechanism helps the l-selectin molecules on the surface of naive t cells to weakly interact with glycam-1 and cd34 molecules on hev cells. the chemokine ccl21 then binds to its receptor ccr7 expressed on the t cell. this binding induces a conformational change in the lfa-1 molecule causing it to bind tightly to icam-1.  this tight binding stops further movement of the t cell which can then move between hev cells into the lymph node by a process termed 'diapedesis' (or extravasation).


== markers ==
despite intensive efforts, few hev-specific markers have been described. the best hev marker currently available is a carbohydrate epitope recognized by the monoclonal antibody (mab) meca-79, which stains all hevs within lymphoid tissues and does not react with postcapillary venules or large vessels in spleen, thymus or nonlymphoid tissues. meca-79 mab inhibits lymphocyte emigration
through hevs into lymph nodes in vivo and lymphocyte adhesion to lymph node and tonsil hevs  in vitro. although initially produced against mouse hevs, the mab shows a wide crossreactivity among species. the meca-79 carbohydrate epitope decorates a family of hev counter-receptors for l-selectin, both in mouse and human16. another mab, heca-452, recognizing a carbohydrate epitope expressed on human hevs but not on other vessels, has been described.  nevertheless, unlike meca-79, this mab is not hev specific: heca-452 recognizes a carbohydrate epitope related to the sialyl-lewis x and sialyl-lewis a oligosaccharides and, in addition to reacting with high endothelium, crossreacts with monocytic cells,  dendritic cells and a subset of skin-homing memory lymphocytes.furthermore, two other hev markers have been described in the mouse: 

the mab meca-325 defines an antigen that can be induced in nonlymphoid endothelial cells by interferon γ ( ifn- γ); and
the mab meca-367 recognizes mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (madcam-1), a counter-receptor for l-selectin and α4β7 integrin that is expressed in mucosal hevs and in venules of intestinal lamina propria but can be induced in nonmucosal endothelial cells by tumor necrosis factor cx (tnf- α) and il-l.


== in chronic human inflammatory disease ==
the vessels with hev characteristics appear in human tissue in association with long-standing chronic inflammation. in rheumatoid arthritis, it has been observed that the level of sulfate incorporation as well as the 'plumpness' (or 'tallness') of the endothelium in areas of lymphocytic infiltration in the synovial membrane are closely related to the concentration of the lymphocytes in the perivascular infiltrates. similarly, expression of meca-79 and heca-452 on these vessels is most pronounced in association with extensive lymphoid infiltrates. therefore, the development of bona fide hevs in the synovial membrane of patients with rheumatoid arthritis is likely to facilitate large-scale influx of lymphocytes, leading to amplification and maintenance of chronic inflammation. the development of hevs after prolonged inflammatory stimulus is not restricted to diseased synovium, but can also occur in other tissues, particularly the gut and thyroid. during chronic inflammation of the gut in inflammatory bowel diseases (crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) or the thyroid in autoimmune thyroiditis (graves' disease and hashimoto's thyroiditis), areas of dense lymphocytic infiltration contain vessels with plump endothelium expressing meca-79 and heca-452. these observations suggest that hevs could play an important role in the pathogenesis of these diseases by mediating abnormal lymphocyte recruitment to the gut or the thyroid. meca-79+ venules with plump endothelium have also been detected in other sites of chronic inflammation, including many cutaneous inflammatory lesions. the presence of meca-79+ hev-like vessels in many different human chronic inflammatory diseases indicates that l-selectin is likely to play a major role in lymphocyte emigration at chronic inflammatory sites.

ford fiesta (first generation),non_science,"the ford fiesta mk1 is the first generation of the ford fiesta supermini. originally introduced in 1976, it was ford europe's first multi-national front-wheel-drive automobile, and was available in both 3-door hatchback and panel van derivatives. in 1983, the fiesta was updated, and the fiesta mk2 was introduced.


== history ==
the fiesta was originally developed under the project name ""bobcat"" (not to be confused with the subsequent rebadged mercury variant of the ford pinto) and approved for development by henry ford ii in september 1972. development targets indicated a production cost us$100 less than the current escort. the car was to have a wheelbase longer than that of the fiat 127 (although shorter than some other rivals, like the peugeot 104, renault 5 and volkswagen polo), but with an overall length shorter than that of the escort. the final proposal was developed by tom tjaarda at ghia. the project was approved for production in december 1973, with ford's engineering centres in cologne and dunton (essex) collaborating.ford estimated that 500,000 fiestas a year would be produced, and built an all-new factory near valencia, spain; a trans-axle factory near bordeaux, france; factory extensions for the assembly plants in dagenham, uk. final assembly also took place in valencia.the name fiesta belonged to general motors when the car was designed, as they had used the name for the oldsmobile fiesta in the 1950s; however, it was freely given for ford to use on their new supermini. ford's marketing team had preferred the name bravo, but henry ford ii vetoed it in favour of the fiesta name. the motoring press had begun speculating about the existence of the bobcat project since 1973, but it was not until december 1975 that ford officially announced it as the fiesta. a fiesta was on display at the 24 hours of le mans in june 1976, and a few rallys. mechanically, the fiesta followed tradition with an end-on four-speed manual transmission of the ford bc-series mounted to a new version of the ford kent ohv engine, dubbed ""valencia"" after the brand new spanish factory in almussafes, valencia, developed especially to produce the new car. ford's plants in dagenham, england, and saarlouis and cologne (from 1979) in germany, also manufactured fiestas. to cut costs and speed up the research and development, the new powertrain package destined for the fiesta was tested in fiat 127 development ""mules"". unlike several rivals, which used torsion bars in their suspension, the fiesta used coil springs. the front suspension was of ford's typical ""track control arm"" arrangement, where macpherson struts were combined with lower control arms and longitudinal compression links. the standard rear suspension used a beam axle, trailing links and a panhard rod, whilst an anti-roll bar was included in the sports package. all mk1 fiestas featured 12-inch wheels as standard, with disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the rear. ford paid particular attention ease of service, and published the times required to replace various common parts.


== model history ==
although not the first ford vehicle to feature front-wheel drive (the 1960s taunus produced by ford of germany laid claim to that title), the fiesta is widely credited as being ford's first globally successful front-wheel-drive model. uk sales began in january 1977, where it was available from £1,856 for the basic 950 cc-engined model.it was only the second hatchback supermini to have been built in the uk at this stage, being launched a year after the vauxhall chevette, but nearly a year before the launch of the chrysler sunbeam and four years before the austin metro. the millionth fiesta was produced in 1979.

the car was initially available in europe with the valencia 957 cc (58.4 cu in) i4 (high compression and low compression options), and 1,117 cc (68.2 cu in) engines and in base, popular, l, gl (1978 onward), ghia and s trim, as well as a van.  the u.s. mark i fiesta was built in saarlouis and cologne, germany but to slightly different specifications; u.s. models were base, decor, sport, and ghia, the ghia having the highest level of trim. these trim levels changed very little in the fiesta's three-year run in the us, from 1977 to 1980. all u.s. models featured the more powerful 1,596 cc (97.4 cu in) engine, (which was the older ""crossflow"" version of the kent, rather than the valencia) fitted with a catalytic converter and air pump to satisfy strict californian emission regulations), energy-absorbing bumpers, side-marker lamps, round sealed-beam headlamps, improved crash dynamics and fuel system integrity as well as optional air conditioning (a/c was not available in europe). in the u.s. market, the ford escort replaced both the fiesta and the compact pinto in 1981.
at the beginning of the british government's motability scheme for disabled motorists in 1978, the fiesta was one of the key cars to be available on the scheme.a sporting derivative (1.3 l supersport) was offered in europe for the 1980 model year, using the 1.3 l (79 cu in) kent crossflow engine,  effectively to test the market for the similar xr2 introduced a year later, which featured a 1.6 l version of the same engine. black plastic trim was added to the exterior and interior. the small square headlights were replaced with larger circular ones resulting in the front indicators being moved into the bumper to accommodate the change. with a quoted performance of 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) in 9.3 seconds and 105 mph (169 km/h) top speed, the xr2 hot hatch became a cult car beloved of boy racers throughout the 1980s.
for the 1979 auto show season, ford in conjunction with its ghia operations in turin, italy,  produced the ford fiesta tuareg off-road car.  it was touted in press materials as ""a concept vehicle designed and equipped for practical, off-road recreational use.""minor revisions appeared across the range in late 1981, with larger bumpers to meet crash worthiness regulations and other small improvements in a bid to maintain showroom appeal ahead of the forthcoming second generation.
it was well-received on most european markets, particularly the united kingdom, where it was the ninth best selling car in its first year, and by 1981 it was the third best seller. however, in 1982 it was outsold by bl's new austin metro, and with a host of new superminis being launched across europe between september 1982 and june 1983, ford was keen to update the fiesta in order to keep it competitive with its rivals.

in 1981, coachbuilders crayford developed a convertible version of the fiesta, which was dubbed the fiesta fly. designed by david mcmullan, the fiesta fly had a permanently welded-shut boot, with a plastic sill fitted to prevent the car from needing to be repainted. the production history of the fiesta fly is not clear; but the common claim that only 20 or so cars were built is probably untrue; it is believed that this figure refers to the number built by crayford, rather than the number built in total. what is known is that dorset-based firm f. english coachwork division bought the rights to produce the fiesta fly sometime in 1982, and autocar reported in september 1983 that about 100 fiesta fly conversions had been produced. it is believed that f english built around 200 fiesta flys, with 83 known to survive. crayford also reportedly built two fiesta flys based on the mk2 fiesta. it was also possible to purchase any production fiesta model in fiesta fly form, not just the 1300 and xr2 models as often reported.

ben domain-containing protein 2,protein,"bend2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the bend2 gene. it is also found in other vertebrates, including mammals, birds, and reptiles. the expression of bend2 in homo sapiens is regulated and occurs at high levels in the skeletal muscle tissue of the male testis and in the bone marrow. the presence of the ben domains in the bend2 protein indicates that this protein may be involved in chromatin modification and regulation.


== gene ==


=== common aliases ===
bend2 stands for ben domain containing 2 and is also known as cxorf20 (hgnc id: 28509).


=== locus and size ===
the locus for bend2 is on the minus strand of the x chromosome at xp22.13. the gene is approximately 58 kilobases in length.


== mrna ==


=== alternative splicing ===
bend2 contains 14 exons which undergo alternative splicing to create five transcript variants that vary from 4,720 base pairs (bp) to 2,144 bp in the mature mrna. the longest and most complete transcript of the gene, variant 1, encodes isoform 1 of the bend2 protein (np_699177.2).


=== 5' and 3'utr ===
the untranslated regions (utr) flanking the coding sequence of bend2 at the 5' and 3' end of the mature mrna molecule contain sites for rna-binding proteins, including rbmx, pum2, and eif4b as well as microrna binding sites. the 5'utr also contains an upstream in-frame stop codon and the 3'utr contains a polyadenylation signal sequence.


== protein (isoform 1) ==


=== molecular weight and internal composition ===
the predicted molecular weight is 87.9 kdal.the predicted isoelectric point is ph 5.07.the internal composition is enriched for serine residues.


=== isoforms ===
corresponding to the five alternative transcripts of bend2, the protein encoded by this gene is found in two isoforms (1 and 2) as well as three predicted structures (x1, x2, and x3). these isoforms range from 813 to 645 amino acids in length. isoform 1 is 799 amino acids in length.


=== subcellular location ===
the presence of nuclear localization signals within the amino acid sequence or primary structure of the bend2 protein leads to a prediction of subcellular localization in the nucleus. the pat7 [(p-x(1-3)-(3-4k/r)] signal and a nuclear bipartite signal are both found near the n-terminus of the protein.


=== structure ===
the secondary structure for bend2 is unclear, in particular at the n-terminus, which is poorly conserved between orthologs. the c-terminus contains two ben domains, which are predicted to form a series of alpha helices.


=== post-translational modifications ===
based on its primary structure, bend2 is predicted to undergo n-terminus acetylation, glycation of several lysine residues, sumolation, a sumo interaction at the n-terminus, s-palmitoylation, and extensive phosphorylation.


=== interacting proteins ===
bend2 is found to interact with the following proteins through experimental yeast two-hybrid screens or pull down assays. 


== ben domains (protein feature) ==
bend2 has two ben domains at its c-terminus. ben domains are found in a diverse array of proteins and are predicted to be important for chromatin remodeling as well as for the recruitment of chromatin-modifying factors utilized during the process of transcriptional regulation of gene expression.  ben domains are predicted to form four alpha helices that allow this domain to interact with its dna target.dai et al. 2013 showed that the drosophila melanogaster insensitive (insv) gene and corresponding protein has no domains of known chemical function yet it contains a single ben domain. they illustrated the activity of the insv protein in transcriptional regulation of genes and obtained a crystal structure of two insv ben domains interacting with their dna target site.


== expression ==


=== tissue expression pattern ===
the expression of the bend2 gene is regulated and it is therefore not ubiquitously expressed in the human body. high expression occurs in the testis and in the bone marrow. the ncbi est profile for this gene shows expression only in the testis and in the muscle.


=== transcriptional regulation of expression ===
the promoter regulating expression of bend2 (gxp_2567556) is 1255 base pairs in length and is located directly upstream of the bend2 gene. it regulates transcription of all five transcriptional variants of bend2. genomatix's matinspector program predicted 418 transcription factor binding sites within the bend2 promoter, including for sry, neurogenin, interferon regulatory factor-3 (irf-3), ikaros2, and tcf/lef-1.


== homology ==


=== paralogs ===
the bend2 protein has no known paralogs within the human genome.


=== ben-domain containing gene family ===
the bend2 gene belongs to a family of human genes known as ""ben-domain containing”. this includes banp (bend1), bend3, bend4, bend5, bend6, bend7, nacc1 (bend8), and nacc2 (bend9). the loci for these genes are spread throughout the human genome. each of these genes contains between one and four ben domains. except for at these motifs, the genes of the ben family do not have similar sequences.


=== orthologs ===
the bend2 gene is conserved across evolutionary time as it has 114 known orthologs in a wide range of vertebrate species including mammals, birds, crocodilia, and amphibians. the bend2 protein has 42 known orthologs. the c-terminus of the protein, the location of its ben domains, is highly conserved; however, the n-terminus is not well conserved, even within the order of primates.  


== function ==
bend2 is predicted to be a dna-binding protein due to the presence of ben domains at its c-terminus, a hypothesis supported by its localization to the nucleus, the transcription factors found in its promoter region, and the nature of the proteins it interacts with. though the precise function of the bend2 protein is not yet well understood by the scientific community, ben domains have been found to be important regulators of transcription.


== clinical significance ==
the diseases that have been linked to bend2 are related to the central nervous system though expression of the gene is not highly observed in these tissues. 

bend2 was identified as one of the genes that causes a central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumor when fused with the mn1 gene, which is located on chromosome 22.
a rare primary central nervous system lymphoma tumor was found to have a high mutation ratio for bend2; however, the authors do not describe this gene as primarily responsible for the tumor.
a young girl diagnosed with severe epileptic encephalopathy was found to have a 300-kb deletion in a region that included bend2, an extremely rare mutation not found in her parents’ genomes.
an individual with adult autism was identified to have a copy-number variant of unknown significance in a region only containing bend2.

ethambutol,antibiotic,"ethambutol (emb, e) is a medication primarily used to treat tuberculosis. it is usually given in combination with other tuberculosis medications, such as isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide. it may also be used to treat mycobacterium avium complex, and mycobacterium kansasii. it is taken by mouth.common side effects include problems with vision, joint pain, nausea, headaches, and feeling tired. other side effects include liver problems and allergic reactions. it is not recommended in people with optic neuritis, significant kidney problems, or under the age of five. use during pregnancy or breastfeeding has not been found to cause harm. in the united states the fda has raised concerns about eye issues in the baby if used during pregnancy. ethambutol is believed to work by interfering with the bacteria's metabolism.ethambutol was discovered in 1961. it is on the world health organization's list of essential medicines and is available as a generic medication.


== medical uses ==
ethambutol is used along with other medications to treat a number of infections including: tuberculosis, mycobacterium avium complex, and mycobacterium kansasii.


== adverse effects ==
optic neuritis (hence contraindicated in children below six years of age)
red-green color blindness people taking ethambutol should be monitored for changes in visual acuity and color discrimination.
arthralgia
hyperuricaemia
vertical nystagmus
milk skin reaction


== mechanism of action ==
ethambutol is bacteriostatic against actively growing tb bacilli. it works by obstructing the formation of cell wall. mycolic acids attach to the 5'-hydroxyl groups of d-arabinose residues of arabinogalactan and form mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex in the cell wall. it disrupts arabinogalactan synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme arabinosyl transferase. disruption of the arabinogalactan synthesis inhibits the formation of this complex and leads to increased permeability of the cell wall.


== pharmacokinetics ==
it is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and well distributed in body tissues and fluids.  50% is excreted unchanged in urine.

shakiriyya,non_science,"the shākiriyya were a regular cavalry regiment of the abbasid caliphate in the ""samarra period"" in the 9th century. probably of khurasani and iranian origin, they were rivals of the turkish guard, and played a major role in the court conflicts that marked the decade of the ""anarchy at samarra"" in the 860s.


== origin ==
the term derives from the persian chākir, ""household servant"", later also with the meaning of ""bodyguard"". the term appears in the umayyad period, but exclusively for the native iranian armed retinues of transoxianian potentates, both arabs and non-arabs.the term vanishes from the sources after the abbasid revolution, and reappears only in a letter by the khurasani iranian noble tahir ibn husayn to caliph al-ma'mun (r. 813–833), during civil war of the fourth fitna. it then appears as a distinct group in 839/840, in al-tabari's history of the reign of al-mu'tasim (r. 833–842).by the reign of al-wathiq, but likely already during the reign of al-mu'tasim, they had been formed into a distinct contingent or regiment of the regular army. in the sources, they usually appear along with the jund, which in earlier times signified the free arab warriors, as distinct from the turkish corps of slave soldiers (mawālī or ghilmān) created by al-mu'tasim. they were administered by a special fiscal department, the dīwān al-jund wa-al-shākiriyya.in the sources they only appear as cavalry, and in small detachments of a few hundred, although the total force probably numbered a few thousand (but not likely more than 5,000). unlike the turks, who were concentrated around the caliph in samarra, the new capital established by al-mu'tasim, the shākiriyya were spread out. they had cantonments not only in samarra, but also in the old capital baghdad, in raqqa in upper mesopotamia, along the  road to mecca, in egypt, fars, and possibly also adharbayjan.


== ethnic composition and politics ==
their ethnic composition is not discussed explicitly in the sources, but it appears that they were mostly of khurasani iranian origin, drawn from the troops that had fought for al-ma'mun in the fourth fitna. in the list of cantonments of the regular regiments in samarra a number of khurasani commanders (quwwād) and their followers (aṣhāb) are mentioned as settled ""in the jund and the shākiriyya"", and in the few occasions where shākirī commanders are mentioned, their names denote a khurasani origin. hugh n. kennedy suggested that these troops were raised by tahir ibn husayn for service in the west, and that the name was chosen as ""a sort of honorific, referring back to a heroic and chivalrous past"". kennedy also suggested that remnants of the pre-civil war abbasid army, the abnāʾ al-dawla, may have been incorporated in the jund and shākiriyya.from their very origin, the shākiriyya were rivals of the turks for power and influence at court; on his accession, caliph al-mutawakkil (r. 847–861) paid them double the donative given to the turks, as a deliberate move to court their favour and use them as a counterbalance to the latter. likewise, the shākiriyya appear to have been partisans of the tahirid governors of baghdad, the heirs of tahir ibn husayn, at least until the abbasid civil war of 865–866.


== history ==
in 839/840, the governor of yemen, ja'far ibn dinar al-khayyat, attacked ""those of the shākiriyya  that were with him"", causing the ire of al-mu'tasim, who dismissed and briefly imprisoned him. in 844/845, when the banu sulaym bedouin in the hejaz became restive, al-wathiq sent hammad ibn jarir al-tabari with 200 shākiriyya to prevent them from entering medina. as the rebellion continued, more troops under bugha the elder were dispatched, including turks and shākiriyya. bugha defeated the tribes and suppressed the uprising.in 848/849, the shākiriyya participated in repeated efforts of quelling the resistance of the rebel muhammad ibn al-ba'ith ibn halbas in adharbayjan. ibn al-ba'ith had fortified himself with his followers in the city of marand and withstood several abbasid attacks, until bugha al-shabir managed to turn many of his supporters away with letters of pardon and safe-conduct (amān). in the same year, many of the shākiriyya escorted the prominent turkish leader itakh when he went on the hajj, but when the latter entered baghdad on his return journey, the local shākiriyya supported the moves of the tahirid governor of baghdad, ishaq ibn ibrahim al-mus'abi which led to itakh's arrest and death.forty shākiriyya horsemen participated along with 30 turks and 30 maghāriba horsemen in the escort for the prisoner exchange with the byzantines in early 856. the presence of shākiriyya stationed in egypt is mentioned by al-tabari for 855/856, during the revolt of the bujah people.when a disgruntled faction of the turks murdered caliph al-mutawakkil in 861, the jund and the shākiriyya gathered before the public gate of the palace to protest. in the summer of 862, a contingent of shākiriyya participated in the army of 10,000 men led by wasif al-turki against the byzantine frontier region, that resulted in the capture of faruriyyah. on 9 june 862, two days after the accession of al-musta'in (r. 862–866), a group of fifty shākiriyya, joined by tabariyya cavalry and other soldiers, as well as the ""hotheads and the rabble from the market"", charged the escort of the caliph, provided by the ushrusaniyya and maghariba regiments, shouting ""victory to al-mu'tazz"", the son of al-mutawakkil who had been forced to renounce his succession rights in april, under pressure from the turkish commanders. the riot was suppressed with heavy losses on both sides.on 26 march 863, amidst the emotional response of the baghdadi populace over the news of the recent death in battle against the byzantines of two of the most distinguished muslim commanders, umar al-aqta and ali ibn yahya al-armani, the jund and the shākiriyya rioted in baghdad, demanding their salaries. in 864/864, the jund and the shākiriyya in fars rioted against the governor, the tahirid abdallah ibn ishaq ibn ibrahim, and looted his residence; abdallah barely escaped with his own life, while one of his guests was killed.during the siege of baghdad in the civil war of 865–866, the shākiriyya were among the most important defenders of baghdad and caliph al-musta'in against the samarra forces, and shākiriyya flocked to the city from outlying garrisons as far as raqqa and malatya to sustain the struggle. one of the tahirids, al-husayn ibn isma'il, was a commander of the shākiriyya during the conflict. when the tahirid governor of baghdad muhammad ibn abdallah ibn tahir negotiated a settlement that ended the war with the recognition of the samarra-based caliph al-mu'tazz (r. 866–869), the shākiriyya felt betrayed, and rioted on 24 september 866, when their salaries fell in arrears.they managed to maintain their position in baghdad after muhammad's death in 867, until sulayman ibn abdallah ibn tahir, arrived from khurasan in 869 with loyal troops of his own, led by a certain muhammad ibn aws al-balkhi. their arrival, and the demand that they now receive the proceeds of the tahirid estates in iraq, triggered a clash between the forces of ibn aws and the shākiriyya and the populace of baghdad, who were led by junior members of the local tahirid branch: al-husayn ibn isma'il and a former tahirid mawla, al-shah ibn mikal. in the end, ibn aws and his men were expelled from the city and became brigands in the area of the nahrawan canal.during the brief reign of al-muhtadi (r. 869–870), the shākiriyya again opposed the turks, bringing the caliph to safety, and clashing openly with the turks after the death of one of their commanders, attab ibn attab.following the rise of caliph al-mu'tamid (r. 870–892) and his brother al-muwaffaq to power in 870, however, the shākiriyya disappear from record as a distinct body. it is likely that as part of al-muwaffaq's deal with the turks, the latter achieved a monopoly in the military, and all other groups, including the shākiriyya, were disbanded. the men of the shākiriyya may have been otherwise enrolled in the army after that, and it is certain that some of the figures associated with them remained in influential positions for some time—al-husayn ibn isma'il remained chief of police (ṣāḥib al-shurṭa) in baghdad at least until 884/885—and according to kennedy it is possible that some of the old shākiriyya soldiers served with them.

the hospital for sick children (toronto),non_science,"the hospital for sick children (hsc), corporately branded as sickkids, is a major pediatric teaching hospital located on university avenue in toronto, ontario, canada. it is affiliated with the faculty of medicine of the university of toronto.
the hospital's peter gilgan centre for research and learning is believed to be the largest pediatric research tower in the world at 69,677.28 square metres. founded in 1875, the hospital was inspired by the example of great ormond street hospital in london.the hospital is located in the discovery district of downtown toronto on university avenue, adjacent to the toronto general hospital and across from mount sinai hospital and the princess margaret cancer centre—collectively forming a complex known as hospital row, each connected by tunnels and bridges. the hospital is known for its advertisement campaigns and the largest amounts of donations received for any canadian hospital.


== history ==

during 1875, an eleven-room house was rented for $320 a year by a toronto women's bible study group led by elizabeth mcmaster. opened on march 1, they set up six iron cots and ""declared open a hospital 'for the admission and treatment of all sick children.'"" their first patient, a scalding victim named maggie, came in on april 3. forty-four patients were admitted to the hospital in its first year of operation and sixty-seven others were treated in outpatient clinics.in 1876 the hospital moved to larger facilities. in 1891 the hospital moved from rented premises to a building constructed for it at college and elizabeth streets where it would remain for sixty years. this old building, known as the victoria hospital for sick children, is now the toronto area headquarters of canadian blood services. in 1951 the hospital moved to its present university avenue location, on the grounds where canadian-born movie star mary pickford's childhood home once stood.in 1972, the hospital was equipped with a rooftop helipad (cnw8). today, it is one of two downtown toronto hospitals with a helipad (the other being st. michael's hospital) and one of three in toronto (the third being at sunnybrook hospital).
sickkids hospital underwent a major expansion in 1993 with the construction of a glass-roofed atrium on the east side of the main building. in late 2008, the hospital underwent a major renovation in the emergency wing.


== funding ==

medical treatments at the hospital are covered by publicly funded health insurance, as is the case in most other canadian hospitals. philanthropy is a critical source of funding for sickkids hospital that is separate and distinct from government and granting agencies. in 2006/07, financial support from sickkids foundation to the hospital totalled $72.1 million. the support went towards infrastructure and support for physicians, researchers and scientists who compete for national and international research grants. next to government, sickkids foundation is the largest funding agency in child health research, education and care in canada. the foundation maintains a fund, called the herbie fund, for patients not covered by canadian health insurance. the fund was established in 1979 to provide for the treatment of herbie quiñones, a seven-month-old patient from brooklyn, new york.


== contributions to medicine ==
the hospital was an early leader in the fields of food safety and nutrition. in 1908 a pasteurization facility for milk was established at the hospital, the first in toronto, and 30 years before milk pasteurization became mandatory. researchers at the hospital invented the infant cereal, pablum. the research that led to the discovery of insulin took place nearby at the university of toronto and was soon applied at the hospital. doctor frederick banting, one of the researchers, had served his internship at sickkids hospital and went on to become an attending physician there. in 1963 william thornton mustard developed the mustard surgical procedure used to help correct heart problems in blue baby syndrome. in 1989, a team of researchers at the hospital discovered the gene responsible for cystic fibrosis.


== controversy ==
the hospital housed the motherisk drug testing laboratory. at the request of various child protection agencies 16,000 hair samples were tested from 2005 to 2015. former ontario appeal court judge susan lang reviewed motherisk drug testing laboratory and determined that they were not qualified to do forensic testing. lang also stated ""that sickkids failed to exercise meaningful oversight over mdtl's work must be considered in the context of the hospital's experience with dr. charles smith"". the 2008 goudge report found dr. charles smith, whose forensic testimony led to wrongful convictions in the deaths of children, was also not qualified to do forensic testing.


== future ==
the hospital is in the initial stages of expansion. in 2017 it established the ""sickkids vs limits"" fundraising campaign that will continue until 2022 to raise $1.3 billion for the expansion project. the funds will be used to build a patient care centre on university avenue, a support centre on elizabeth street, to renovate the atrium, and to fund pediatric health research.to provide the required area for the buildings, demolition of existing structures was required. this included removal of a skyway spanning elizabeth street, demolition of the elizabeth mcmaster building at the northeast corner of elizabeth street and elm street, and demolition of the laboratory and administrative building.construction of the 22-storey patient support centre administrative building will occur on the site of the elizabeth mcmaster building, and will be completed in 2022. the peter gilgan family patient care tower is expected to open in 2029, and the atrium renovation to be completed by 2031.

telavancin,antibiotic,"telavancin (trade name vibativ) is a bactericidal lipoglycopeptide for use in mrsa or other gram-positive infections. telavancin is a semi-synthetic derivative of vancomycin.the fda approved the drug in september 2009 for complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssi), and in june 2013 for hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia caused by staphylococcus aureus.


== history ==
on 19 october 2007, the us food and drug administration (fda) issued an approvable letter for telavancin. its developer, theravance, submitted a complete response to the letter, and the fda has assigned a prescription drug user fee act (pdufa) target date of 21 july 2008.on 19 november 2008, an fda antiinfective drug advisory committee concluded that they would recommend telavancin be approved by the fda.
the fda approved the drug on 11 september 2009 for complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssi).theravance has also submitted telavancin to the fda in a second indication, nosocomial pneumonia, sometimes referred to as hospital-acquired pneumonia, or hap. on 30 november 2012, an fda advisory panel endorsed approval of a once-daily formulation of telavancin for nosocomial pneumonia when other alternatives are not suitable. however, telavancin did not win the advisory committee's recommendation as first-line therapy for this indication. the committee indicated that the trial data did not prove ""substantial evidence"" of telavancin's safety and efficacy in hospital-acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by gram-positive organisms staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. on 21 june 2013 fda gave approval for telavancin to treat patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia, but indicated it should be used only when alternative treatments are not suitable. fda staff had indicated telavancin has a ""substantially higher risk for death"" for patients with kidney problems or diabetes compared to vancomycin.on march 11 2013, clinigen group plc and theravance, inc. announced that they have entered into an exclusive commercialization agreement in the european union (eu) and certain other countries located in europe for vibativ® (telavancin) for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia (hospital-acquired), including ventilator-associated pneumonia, known or suspected to be caused by methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) when other alternatives are not suitable.


== mechanism of action ==
like vancomycin, telavancin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to the d-ala-d-ala terminus of the peptidoglycan in the growing cell wall (see pharmacology and chemistry of vancomycin). in addition, it disrupts bacterial membranes by depolarization.


== adverse effects ==
common but harmless adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, constipation, and headache.telavancin has a higher rate of kidney failure than vancomycin in two clinical trials. it showed teratogenic effects in animal studies.


== interactions ==
telavancin inhibits the liver enzymes cyp3a4 and cyp3a5. no data regarding the clinical relevance are available.

granule cell precursor,cell,"the name granule cell has been used for a number of different types of neuron whose only common feature is that they all have very small cell bodies.  granule cells are found within the granular layer of the cerebellum, the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, the superficial layer of the dorsal cochlear nucleus, the olfactory bulb, and the cerebral cortex.
cerebellar granule cells account for the majority of neurons in the human brain. these granule cells receive excitatory input from mossy fibers originating from pontine nuclei. cerebellar granule cells project up through the purkinje layer into the molecular layer where they branch out into parallel fibers that spread through purkinje cell dendritic arbors. these parallel fibers form thousands of excitatory granule-cell–purkinje-cell synapses onto the intermediate and distal dendrites of purkinje cells using glutamate as a neurotransmitter.
layer 4 granule cells of the cerebral cortex receive inputs from the thalamus and send projections to supragranular layers 2–3, but also to infragranular layers of the cerebral cortex.


== structure ==
granule cells in different brain regions are both functionally and anatomically diverse: the only thing they have in common is smallness. for instance, olfactory bulb granule cells are gabaergic and axonless, while granule cells in the dentate gyrus have glutamatergic projection axons. these two populations of granule cells are also the only major neuronal populations that undergo adult neurogenesis, while cerebellar and cortical granule cells do not.
granule cells (save for those of the olfactory bulb) have a structure typical of a neuron consisting of dendrites, a soma (cell body) and an axon.
dendrites: each granule cell has 3 – 4 stubby dendrites which end in a claw. each of the dendrites are only about 15 μm in length.
soma: granule cells all have a small soma diameter of approximately 10 μm.
axon: each granule cell sends a single axon onto the purkinje cell dendritic tree. the axon has an extremely narrow diameter: ½ micrometre.
synapse: 100–300,000 granule cell axons synapse onto a single purkinje cell.the existence of gap junctions between granule cells allows multiple neurons to be coupled to one another allowing multiple cells to act in synchrony and to allow signalling functions necessary for granule cell development to occur.


=== cerebellar granule cell ===

the granule cells, produced by the rhombic lip, are found in the granule cell layer of the cerebellar cortex. they are small and numerous. they are characterized by a very small soma and several short dendrites which terminate with claw-shaped endings. in the transmission electron microscope, these cells are characterized by a darkly stained nucleus surrounded by a thin rim of cytoplasm. the axon ascends into the molecular layer where it splits to form parallel fibers.


=== dentate gyrus granule cell ===
the principal cell type of the dentate gyrus is the granule cell. the dentate gyrus granule cell has an elliptical cell body with a width of approximately 10 μm and a height of 18μm.the granule cell has a characteristic cone-shaped tree of spiny apical dendrites. the dendrite branches project throughout the entire molecular layer and the furthest tips of the dendritic tree end just at the hippocampal fissure or at the ventricular surface. the granule cells are tightly packed in the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus.


=== dorsal cochlear nucleus granule cell ===
the granule cells in the dorsal cochlear nucleus are small neurons with two or three short dendrites that give rise to a few branches with expansions at the terminals. the dendrites are short with claw-like endings that form glomeruli to receive mossy fibers, similar to cerebellar granule cells. its axon projects to the molecular layer of the dorsal cochlear nucleus where it forms parallel fibers, also similar to cerebellar granule cells.
the dorsal cochlear granule cells are small excitatory interneurons which are developmentally related and thus resemble the cerebellar granule cell.


=== olfactory bulb granule cell ===
the main intrinsic granule cell in the vertebrate olfactory bulb lacks an axon (as does the accessory neuron). each cell gives rise to short central dendrites and a single long apical dendrite that expands into the granule cell layer and enters the mitral cell body layer. the dendrite branches terminate within the outer plexiform layer among the dendrites in the olfactory tract.
in the mammalian olfactory bulb,  granule cells can process both synaptic input and output due to the presence of large spines.


== function ==


=== neural pathways and circuits of the cerebellum ===

cerebellar granule cells receive excitatory input from 3 or 4 mossy fibers originating from pontine nuclei. mossy fibers make an excitatory connection onto granule cells which cause the granule cell to fire an action potential.
the axon of a cerebellar granule cell splits to form a parallel fiber which innervates purkinje cells. the vast majority of granule cell axonal synapses are found on the parallel fibers.the parallel fibers are sent up through the purkinje layer into the molecular layer where they branch out and spread through purkinje cell dendritic arbors. these parallel fibers form thousands of excitatory granule-cell-purkinje-cell synapses onto the dendrites of purkinje cells.
this connection is excitatory as glutamate is released.
the parallel fibers and ascending axon synapses from the same granule cell fire in synchrony which results in excitatory signals. in the cerebellar cortex there are a variety of inhibitory neurons (interneurons). the only excitatory neurons present in the cerebellar cortex are granule cells.plasticity of the synapse between a parallel fiber and a purkinje cell is believed to be important for motor learning. 
the function of cerebellar circuits is entirely dependent on processes carried out by the granular layer. therefore, the function of granule cells determines the cerebellar function as a whole.


=== mossy fiber input on cerebellar granule cells ===
granule cell dendrites also synapse with distinctive unmyelinated axons which santiago ramón y cajal called mossy fibers 
mossy fibers and golgi cells both make synaptic connections with granule cells. together these cells form the glomeruli.granule cells are subject to feed-forward inhibition: granule cells excite purkinje cells but also excite gabaergic interneurons that inhibit purkinje cells.
granule cells are also subject to feedback inhibition:  golgi cells receive excitatory stimuli from granule cells and in turn send back inhibitory signals to the granule cell.mossy fiber input codes are conserved during synaptic transmission between granule cells, suggesting that innervation is specific to the input that is received. granule cells do not just relay signals from mossy fibers, rather they perform various, intricate transformations which are required in the spatiotemporal domain.each granule cell is receiving an input from two different mossy finer inputs. the input is thus coming from two different places as opposed to the granule cell receiving multiple inputs from the same source.
the differences in mossy fibers that are sending signals to the granule cells directly effects the type of information  that granule cells translate to purkinje cells. 
the reliability of this translation will depend on the reliability of synaptic activity in granule cells and on the nature of the stimulus being received. the signal a granule cell receives from a mossy fiber depends on the function of the mossy fiber itself. therefore, granule cells are able to integrate information from the different mossy fibers and generate new patterns of activity.


=== climbing fiber input on cerebellar granule cells ===
different patterns of mossy finer input will produce unique patterns of activity in granule cells that can be modified by a teaching signal conveyed by the climbing fiber input. 
david marr and james albus suggested that the cerebellum operates as an adaptive filter, altering motor behaviour based on the nature of the sensory input.
since multiple (~200,000) granule cells synapse onto a single purkinje cell, the effects of each parallel fiber can be altered in response to a “teacher signal” from the climbing fiber input.


=== specific functions of different granule cells ===
cerebellum granule cellsdavid marr suggested that the granule cells encode combinations of mossy fiber inputs.  in order for the granule cell to respond, it needs to receive active inputs from multiple mossy fibers.  the combination of multiple inputs results in the cerebellum being able to make more precise distinctions between input patterns than a single mossy fiber would allow. 
the cerebellar granule cells also play a role in orchestrating the tonic conductances which control sleep in conjunction with the ambient levels of gaba which are found in the brain.

dentate granule cellsloss of dentate gyrus neurons from the hippocampus results in spatial memory deficits. therefore, dentate granule cells are thought to function in the formation of spatial memories  and of episodic memories. 
immature and mature dentate granule cells have distinct roles in memory function. adult-born granule cells are thought to be involved in pattern separation whereas old granule cells contribute to rapid pattern completion.
dorsal cochlear granule cellspyramidal cells from the primary auditory cortex project directly on to the cochlear nucleus.  this is important in the acoustic startle reflex, in which the pyramidal cells modulate the secondary orientation reflex and the granule cell input is responsible for appropriate orientation. this is because the signals received by the granule cells contain information about the head position.  granule cells in the dorsal cochlear nucleus play a role in the perception and response to sounds in our environment.

olfactory bulb granule cellsinhibition generated by granule cells, the most common gabaergic cell type in the olfactory bulb, plays a critical role in shaping the output of the olfactory bulb. there are two types of excitatory inputs received by gabaergic granule cells; those activated by an ampa receptor and those activated by a nmda receptor. this allows the granule cells to regulate the processing of the sensory input in the olfactory bulb. the olfactory bulb transmits smell information from the nose to the brain, and is thus necessary for a proper sense of smell. granule cells in the olfactory bulb have also been found to be important in forming memories linked with scents.


=== critical factors for function ===
calciumcalcium dynamics are essential for several functions of granule cells such as changing membrane potential, synaptic plasticity, apoptosis, and regulation of gene transcription. the nature of the calcium signals that control the presynaptic and postsynaptic function of the olfactory bulb granule cells spines is mostly unknown.
nitric oxidegranule neurons have high levels of the neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase. this enzyme is dependent on the presence of calcium and is responsible for the production of nitric oxide (no). this neurotransmitter is a negative regulator of granule cell precursor proliferation which promotes the differentiation of different granule cells. 
no regulates interactions between granule cells and glia  and is essential for protecting the granule cells from damage. no is also responsible for neuroplasticity and motor learning.


== role in disease ==


=== altered morphology of dentate granule cells ===
trkb is responsible for the maintenance of normal synaptic connectivity of the dentate granule cells. trkb also regulates the specific morphology (biology) of the granule cells and is thus said to be important in regulating neuronal development, neuronal plasticity, learning, and the development of epilepsy. the trkb regulation of granule cells is important in preventing memory deficits and limbic epilepsy. this is due to the fact that dentate granule cells play a critical role in the function of the entorhinal-hippocampal circuitry in health and disease. dentate granule cells are situated to regulate the flow of information into the hippocampus, a structure required for normal learning and memory.


=== decreased granule cell neurogenesis ===
both epilepsy and depression show a disrupted production of adult-born hippocampal granule cells. epilepsy is associated with increased production - but aberrant integration - of new cells early in the disease and decreased production late in the disease. 
aberrant integration of adult-generated cells during the development of epilepsy may impair the ability of the dentate gyrus to prevent excess excitatory activity from reaching hippocampal pyramidal cells, thereby promoting seizures. 
long-lasting epileptic seizure stimulate dentate granule cell neurogenesis. these newly born dentate granule cells may result in aberrant connections that result in the hippocampal network plasticity associated with epileptogenesis.


=== shorter granule cell dendrites ===
patients suffering from alzheimer's have shorter granule cell dendrites. furthermore, the dendrites were less branched and had fewer spines than those in patients not suffering with alzheimer's. however, granule cell dendrites are not an essential component of senile plaques and these plaques have no direct effect on granule cells in the dentate gyrus. the specific neurofibrillary changes of dentate granule cells occur in patients suffering from alzheimer's, lewy body variant and progressive supranuclear palsy.

copadichromis borleyi,non_science,"copadichromis borleyi is a species of haplochromine cichlid fish endemic to lake malawi in east africa. the species is popular in the fishkeeping hobby where it is frequently kept in aquariums. the species has numerous common names, including redfin hap and goldfin hap.


== description ==
c. borleyi is a relatively small cichlid, males grow to 13-16 centimetres (5–6 in) total length, while females are typically slightly smaller reaching 13 centimetres. in addition to these minor difference in size, the species displays marked sexual dimorphism with males displaying larger ventral fins marked with egg spots, light-blue edging to the dorsal and ventral fins, along with metallic blue colouration of the head, and yellow to red flanks. in contrast, females are silver-to-brown and display three black spots along their sides. juveniles are monomorphic and are coloured like the adult females. some intraspecific variation has been recorded with regard to colouration, these differently coloured forms are geographically restricted to certain localities in lake malawi.


== distribution and habitat ==
c. borleyi is widespread in lake malawi, occurring along the coasts of malawi, mozambique and tanzania. the species is limited to littoral zones with large rocks and boulders. the water in which species is found is warm (24 – 29 °c,75 – 84 °f), hard and alkaline; typical of the water chemistry of lake malawi.


== diet ==
the species feeds primarily on zooplankton, by means of specialized, suction feeding action and highly protrudable mouth.


== taxonomy ==
the species was described in 1960 by thomas derrick iles as haplochromis borleyi, and was later moved to copadichromis by david eccles and ethylwynn trewavas. the species is also known under the synonym cyrtocara borleyi, and is occasionally sold under the trade name of haplochromis granderus. the specific name honours  h. john h. borley who was director of the game fish & tsetse control department of nyasaland.


== reproduction ==

c. borleyi is a polygamous, maternally mouthbrooding cichlid. males frequently claim areas adjacent to, or on top of, large, submerged boulders and spawn on the horizontal upper surface of the boulder. some geographic variants are known to build sand bowers atop large rocks in which spawning and courting takes place. the species has no defined breeding season and breeding occurs year-round.

lung adenoma susceptibility protein 2 (human),protein,"sjögren's syndrome (sjs, ss) is a long-term autoimmune disease that affects the body's moisture-producing (lacrimal and salivary) glands, and often seriously affects other organs systems, such as the lungs, kidneys, and nervous system. primary symptoms are dryness (dry mouth and dry eyes), pain and fatigue. other symptoms can include dry skin, vaginal dryness, a chronic cough, numbness in the arms and legs, feeling tired, muscle and joint pains, and thyroid problems. those affected are also at an increased risk (5%) of lymphoma.while the exact cause is unclear, it is believed to involve a combination of genetics and an environmental trigger such as exposure to a virus or bacterium. it can occur independently of other health problems (primary sjögren's syndrome) or as a result of another connective tissue disorder (secondary sjögren's syndrome). sjs may be associated with other autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (ra), systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) or systemic sclerosis. the inflammation that results progressively damages the glands. diagnosis is by biopsy of moisture-producing glands and blood tests for specific antibodies. on biopsy there are typically lymphocytes within the glands.while ss  is one of the most common auto-immune diseases, it has no specific and non-invasive diagnostic tests and treatment is directed at managing the person's symptoms. for dry eyes, artificial tears, medications to reduce inflammation, punctal plugs, or surgery to shut the tear ducts may be tried. for a dry mouth, chewing gum (preferably sugar-free), sipping water, or a saliva substitute may be used. in those with joint or muscle pain, ibuprofen may be used. medications that can cause dryness, such as antihistamines, may also be stopped. the most specific extant diagnostic test requires lip biopsy.
the disease was described in 1933 by henrik sjögren, after whom it is named; however, a number of earlier descriptions of people with the symptoms exist. between 0.2 and 1.2% of the population is affected, with half having the primary form and half the secondary form. females are affected about 10 times as often as are males. though the disease commonly begins in middle age, anyone can be affected. among those without other autoimmune disorders, life expectancy is unchanged.


== signs and symptoms ==

the hallmark symptom of sjögren syndrome is dry mouth and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eyes). vaginal dryness, dry skin, and dry nose may also occur. other organs of the body may also be affected, including the kidneys, blood vessels, lungs, liver, pancreas, and brain.skin dryness in some people with ss may be the result of lymphocytic infiltration into skin glands. the symptoms may develop insidiously, with the diagnosis often not considered for several years because sicca may be attributed to medications, a dry environment, or aging, or may be regarded as not of a severity warranting the level of investigation necessary to establish the presence of the underlying autoimmune disorder.ss can damage vital organs, with symptoms that may plateau or worsen, or go into remission, as with other autoimmune diseases. some people may experience only the mild symptoms of dry eyes and mouth, while others have symptoms of severe disease. many patients can treat problems symptomatically. others experience blurred vision, constant eye discomfort, recurrent mouth infections, swollen parotid glands, dysphonia (vocal disorders including hoarseness), and difficulty in swallowing and eating. debilitating fatigue and joint pain can seriously impair quality of life. some patients can develop kidney involvement (autoimmune tubulointerstitial nephritis) leading to proteinuria (excess protein in urine), urinary concentrating defect, and distal renal tubular acidosis.


=== complications ===
among the complications discussed above, women with anti-ro/ss-a and anti-la/ss-b antibodies who become pregnant have an increased rate of neonatal lupus erythematosus with congenital heart block requiring a pacemaker. type i cryoglobulinemia is a known complication of ss.ss can affect such organs as the liver, pancreas, kidneys, lungs, and central nervous system.


=== associated conditions ===
ss is associated with a number of other medical conditions, many of which are autoimmune or rheumatic disorders, such as celiac disease, fibromyalgia, sle (lupus), autoimmune thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis and spondyloarthropathy, and several malignancies, principally non-hodgkin lymphoma.


== causes ==
the cause of ss is unknown, but it may be the influence of a combination of genetic, environmental, and other factors, as is the case with many other autoimmune disorders. around 20 autoantibodies could be involved.


=== genetics ===
the observation of high rates of autoimmune disorders in families with ss is linked with a genetic predisposition to the syndrome. studies on the polymorphisms of human leukocyte antigen (hla)-dr and hla-dq gene regions in ss patients show differential susceptibility to the syndrome as the result of different types of the resulting autoantibody production.


=== hormones ===
since ss is associated with a high prevalence in women, sex hormones, especially estrogen, are believed to affect humoral and cell-mediated immune responses affecting susceptibility to the syndrome. androgens are generally considered to prevent autoimmunity. studies on mice models suggest estrogen deficiency stimulates presentation of autoantigens, inducing ss-like symptoms.


=== microchimerism ===
microchimerism of fetal cells (offspring lymphoid cells in maternal circulation) may generate autoimmunity in women who have previously been pregnant. generation of an autoimmune potential via microchimerism may lead to a switch from a silent form of autoimmunity with age-dependent decrease in self-tolerance.


=== environment ===
viral proteins, engulfed molecules, or degraded self-structures may initiate autoimmunity by molecular mimicry and increase the chances of ss development. epstein–barr virus, hepatitis c, and human t-cell leukemia virus-1 are among the most studied infectious agents in ss. to date, no direct causes and effect relationship has been identified between these pathogens and the development of ss.  damaged self-structures targeted for apoptosis may be mistakenly exposed to the immune system, triggering autoimmunity in exocrine glands, which are often prone to autoimmune responses.


== pathogenesis ==
the pathogenetic mechanisms of ss have not been fully elucidated, resulting in the lack of pathophysiology knowledge of the management of this autoimmune exocrinopathy. although the numerous factors contributing to the progression of this disease have made  discovering the exact origin and cause difficult, major advances over the past decade have contributed to a proposed set of pathogenic events that occur prior to the diagnosis of ss.ss was originally proposed as a specific, self-perpetuating, immune system-mediated loss of exocrine glands, specifically acinar and ductal cells. although this explains the more obvious symptoms (such as the lack of saliva and lacrimal fluid), it does not explain the more widespread systemic effects seen in the progression of the disease.in the presence of a susceptible genetic background, both environmental and hormonal factors are thought capable of triggering the infiltration of lymphocytes, specifically cd4+ t cells, b cells, and plasma cells, causing glandular dysfunction in the salivary and lacrimal glands.ss is associated with increased levels in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) of il-1ra, an interleukin 1 antagonist. this suggests that the disease begins with increased activity in the interleukin 1 system, followed by an autoregulatory upregulation of il-1ra to reduce the successful binding of interleukin 1 to its receptors. interleukin 1 likely is the marker for fatigue, but increased il-1ra is observed in the csf and is associated with increased fatigue through cytokine-induced sickness behavior. however, ss is characterized by decreased levels of il-1ra in saliva, which could be responsible for mouth inflammation and dryness. patients with secondary ss also often exhibit signs and symptoms of their primary rheumatic disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, or systemic sclerosis.


=== genetic predisposition ===
the genetic locus most significantly associated with primary ss is the major histocompatibility complex/human leukocyte antigen (mhc/hla) region, as demonstrated by the preliminary results of the first genome-wide association study. this study included data from a discovery cohort of 395 patients of european ancestry with primary ss, and 1,975 healthy control individuals, and from a replication study that comprised 1,234 cases and 4,779 healthy controls. associations with polymorphisms located at six independent loci were also detected; irf5, stat4, blk, il12a, tnip1, and cxcr5. this also suggested the activation of the innate immune system, notably through the ifn system, b-cell activation through cxcr5-directed recruitment to lymphoid follicles and b-cell receptor (bcr) activation involving blk, and t-cell activation owing to hla susceptibility and the il-12-ifn-γ-axis.patients of different ethnic origin carry different hla-susceptibility alleles, of which hla-dr and hla-dq are involved in the pathogenesis of ss. for example, patients from northern and western europe and from north america show a high prevalence of b8, drw52, and dr3 genes. hla class ii alleles are associated with the presence of specific subsets of autoantibodies, rather than with the disease itself. autoantibodies refer to the loss of b-cell tolerance leading to production of antibodies directed against diverse organ-specific and organ nonspecific antigens. association between hla and ss is restricted to patients with anti-ssa/ro or anti-ssb/la antibodies. seropositivity for anti-ro and anti-la is associated with greater severity and longer duration of disease, and findings of their high abundance from the salivary glands of ss patients suggests their imperative role in the pathogenesis of ss.beyond genetics, epigenetic abnormality related to dna methylation, histone acetylation, or microrna expression probably has a key role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including ss, though research in this area is very limited.


=== environmental triggers ===
environmental factors, such as glandular viral infection, could prompt epithelial cells to activate the hla-independent innate immune system through toll-like receptors. although a number of infectious, exogenous agents have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ss, such as epstein-barr virus (ebv), human t-lymphotropic virus 1, and hepatitis c virus, their association with ss appears weak. while ebv is present in the salivary glands of normal individuals, a high incidence of ebv reactivation in ss patients has been reported with increased levels of ebv dna. this indicates viral reactivation and inability of lymphoid infiltrates to control ebv replication in ss, leading to the initiation or perpetuation of an immune response in target organs. nonetheless,  exactly how reactivation of ebv is induced in lesions of patients with ss, and which specific molecular mechanisms are involved in the process of viral reactivation,  remain to be clarified.


=== inflammation ===
epithelial cells in ss lesions are active participants in the induction and perpetuation of the inflammatory process. environmental and hormonal factors, in concert with an appropriate genetic background, are believed to trigger ss, which dysregulates epithelial cells and allows aberrant homing and activation of dendritic cells (dcs), t cells, and b cells. dendritic cells are antigen-presenting cells  that process antigen material and present it to other t cells. following the migration of lymphocytes into the glands in response to chemokines and specific adhesion molecules, t cells interact with epithelial cells. epithelial cells are further activated by proinflammatory cytokines (il-1β, ifn-γ, and tnf), which are produced by adjacent t cells. the early accumulation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells in the target tissues, which produce high levels of type 1 ifns, seems important, as these cells can further dysregulate the immune response through abnormal retention of lymphocytes in the tissues and their subsequent activation. ifn-α stimulates the production of b-cell activating factor (baff) by epithelial cells, dcs, and t cells. baff stimulates aberrant b-cell maturation, leading to the emergence of self-reactive b cells, which locally produce autoantibodies, in a germinal centre-like structure (gc-like), which is also the location of lymphomagenesis (origin of lymphoma).


=== programmed cell death ===
dysregulation of apoptosis (programmed cell death) is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of a variety of autoimmune diseases, though its role in ss is controversial. both the fas and fas ligand proteins are overexpressed in primary ss patients, while expression of bcl-1, which is known to downregulate apoptosis, was found significantly reduced in acinar and ductal epithelial cells of ss patients compared to healthy people. in situ studies did not show increased apoptosis among glandular epithelial cells, but did show reduced apoptosis among infiltrating mononuclear cells. reduced apoptosis was also implicated in the accumulation of autoreactive b-cells found in the glands. the relationship of autoantibodies expressed in ss with apoptosis is still being researched.


=== hormonal factors ===
sex hormones seem to influence humoral and cell-mediated immune response, with estrogen being considered one of the biggest factors responsible for sex-immunologic dimorphism. estrogen deficiency appears to play a role in development of ss. it has been hypothesized that androgen administration to the ocular surface may serve as an effective therapy for dry eyes.


== diagnosis ==

diagnosing ss is complicated by the range of symptoms that a patient may manifest, and the similarity between symptoms of ss and those of other conditions. also, patients with ss symptoms approach different specialities for treatment, which can make diagnosis difficult. since dry eyes and dry mouth are very common symptoms, and frequently occur in people over 40, affected people may believe that the symptoms are age-related, so ignore them. some medications, though,  can cause symptoms similar to those of ss. the combination of several tests, which can be done in a series, can eventually diagnose ss.sjögren syndrome is usually classified as either 'primary' or 'secondary'. primary ss  occurs by itself and secondary ss occurs when another connective tissue disease is present.blood tests can be done to determine if a patient has high levels of antibodies that are indicative of the condition, such as antinuclear antibody (ana) and rheumatoid factor (because ss frequently occurs secondary to rheumatoid arthritis), which are associated with autoimmune diseases. typical ss ana patterns are ssa/ro and ssb/la, of which anti-ssb/la is far more specific; anti-ssa/ro is associated with numerous other autoimmune conditions, but is often present in ss, but aanti-ssa and anti-ssb tests are frequently not positive in ss.the rose bengal test uses a stain that measures state and function of the lacrimal glands. this test involves placing the nontoxic dye rose bengal on the eyes. the dye's distinctive colour helps in determining the state and functioning of tear film and the rate of tear evaporation. any distinctive colour change can indicate ss, but confirming the condition requires many related diagnostic tools.schirmer's test measures the production of tears: a strip of filter paper is held inside the lower eyelid for five minutes, and its wetness is then measured with a ruler. producing less than 5 mm (0.20 in) of liquid is usually indicative of ss. this measurement analysis varies among people depending on other eye-related conditions and medications in use when the test is taken. a slit-lamp examination can reveal dryness on the surface of the eye.symptoms of dry mouth and dryness in the oral cavity are caused by the reduced production of saliva from the salivary glands (parotid gland, submandibular gland, and sublingual gland). to check the status of salivary glands and the production of saliva, a salivary flow-rate test is performed, in which the person is asked to spit as much as they can into a cup, and the resulting saliva sample is collected and weighed. this test's results can determine whether the salivary glands are functioning adequately. not enough saliva produced could mean the person has ss. an alternative test is nonstimulated whole saliva flow collection, in which the person spits into a test tube every minute for 15 minutes. a resultant collection of less than 1.5 ml (0.053 imp fl oz; 0.051 us fl oz) is considered a positive result.a lip/salivary gland biopsy takes a tissue sample that can reveal lymphocytes clustered around salivary glands, and damage to these glands from inflammation. this test involves removing a sample of tissue from a person's inner lip/salivary gland and examining it under a microscope. in addition, a sialogram, a special x-ray test, is performed to see if any blockage is present in the salivary gland ducts (i.e. parotid duct) and the amount of saliva that flows into the mouth.a radiological procedure is available as a reliable and accurate test for ss. a contrast agent is injected into the parotid duct, which opens from the cheek into the vestibule of the mouth opposite the neck of the upper second molar tooth. histopathology studies should show focal lymphocytic sialadenitis. objective evidence of salivary gland involvement is tested through ultrasound examinations, the level of unstimulated whole salivary flow, a parotid sialography or salivary scintigraphy, and autoantibodies against ro (ssa) and/or la (ssb) antigens.ss can be excluded from people with past head and neck radiation therapy, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, pre-existing lymphoma, sarcoidosis, graft-versus-host disease, and use of anticholinergic drugs.


== prevention ==
no prevention mechanism exists for ss because of its complexity as an autoimmune disorder, but lifestyle changes can reduce the risk factors related to developing ss or reduce the severity of the condition for patients who have already been diagnosed. diet is strongly associated with the inflammation seen in many autoimmune related diseases, including ss. an experimental study concluded that ss patients show high sensitivity to gluten that directly relates to inflammation. moderate exercise is also helpful in ss patients, mainly reducing the effect of lung inflammation.


== treatment ==
neither a cure nor a specific treatment for ss is known to permanently restore gland secretion. instead, treatment is generally symptomatic and supportive.


=== eye care ===
moisture replacement therapies such as artificial tears may ease the symptoms of dry eyes. some patients with more severe problems use goggles to increase local humidity or have punctal plugs inserted to help retain tears on the ocular surface for a longer time.additionally, cyclosporine (restasis) is available by prescription to treat chronic dry eye by suppressing the inflammation that disrupts tear secretion. prescription drugs are also available that help to stimulate salivary flow, such as cevimeline (evoxac) and pilocarpine. salagen, a manufactured form of pilocarpine, can be used to help produce tears, as well as saliva in the mouth and intestines. it is derived from the jaborandi plant.


=== vaginal dryness ===
in women with ss, vaginal dryness, vulvodynia and dyspareunia (painful sexual intercourse) are often reported; personal lubricants are recommended to help lessen irritation or pain that may result from dryness in the vaginal and vulval areas.


=== musculoskeletal ===
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) may be used to treat musculoskeletal symptoms. for individuals with severe complications, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs may be prescribed, and sometimes intravenous immunoglobulins. also, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs  such as methotrexate may be helpful. hydroxychloroquine (plaquenil) is another option and is generally considered safer than methotrexate. however, these prescribed drugs have a range of side effects such as nausea, loss of appetite, dizziness, hair loss, stomach aches/cramps, headache, liver toxicity and increased risk of infections. also, those who take drugs to suppress the immune system are more likely to develop cancer later.


=== systemic ===
for systemic symptoms, including fatigue, joint pain, myositis and neuropathy, biologic immunosuppressant drugs such as rituximab and belimumab that work via b-cell pathology are often used and have less toxic profiles than traditional immunosuppressive regimens.


=== dental care ===
preventive dental treatment is also necessary (and often overlooked by the patient), as the lack of saliva associated with xerostomia creates an ideal environment for the proliferation of bacteria that cause cavities. treatments include at-home topical fluoride application to strengthen tooth enamel and frequent teeth cleanings by a dental hygienist. existing cavities must also be treated, as cavities that extend into the tooth cannot be effectively treated by teeth cleaning alone, and are at a high risk of spreading into the pulp of the tooth, leading to the loss of vitality and need for extraction or root canal therapy. this treatment regimen is the same as for all xerostomia patients, such as for those undergoing head and neck radiation therapy, which often damages the salivary glands; these glands are more susceptible to radiation than are other body tissues.


== prognosis ==
published studies on the survival of ss patients are limited in varied respects, perhaps owing to the relatively small sample sizes, and secondary ss is associated with other autoimmune diseases. results from a number of studies indicate that, compared to other autoimmune diseases, ss is associated with a notably high incidence of malignant non-hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer of white blood cells. about 5% of patients with ss develop some form of lymphoid malignancy. patients with severe cases are much more likely to develop lymphomas than patients with mild or moderate cases. the most common lymphomas are salivary extranodal marginal zone b cell lymphomas (malt lymphomas in the salivary glands) and diffuse large b-cell lymphoma.lymphomagenesis in primary ss patients is considered as a multistep process, with the first step being chronic stimulation of autoimmune b cells, especially b cells that produce rheumatoid factor  at sites targeted by the disease. this increases the frequency of oncogenic mutation, leading to any dysfunction at checkpoints of autoimmune b-cell activation to transform into malignancy. a study's finding has concluded the continuous stimulation of autoimmune b cells, leading to subtle germinal abnormalities in genes having specific consequences in b cells, which underlies the susceptibility to lymphoma.apart from this notably higher incidence of malignant nhl, ss patients show only modest or clinically insignificant deterioration in specific organ-related function, which explains the only slight increases in mortality rates of ss patients in comparison with the remainder of the population.sjogren's syndrome is associated with a high burden of illness, and has been shown to markedly reduce quality of life (qol), with a significant impact on ability to work resulting from increased rates of disability. the reduction in qol is similar to that seen in other chronic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and fibromyalgia.


== epidemiology ==
ss is the second-most common rheumatic autoimmune disorder, behind rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. there are no geographical differences in the rates of ss. ss has been reported in all areas of the world, although regional rates have not been well studied. depending on the criteria for determining prevalence, studies estimate the prevalence of ss at between 500,000 and two million people in the united states. broader studies of ss prevalence range widely, with some reports of up to a prevalence of 3% of the population. a few studies that have reported that the incidence of the syndrome varies between three and six per 100,000 per year.nine out of 10 ss patients are women. in addition to prevalence in women, having a first-degree relative with an autoimmune disease and previous pregnancies have been identified as epidemiological risk factors. despite the lower risk for men, primary ss in men tends to represent a more severe form of the disease. the role of race and ethnicity in the prevalence of the disease is unknown.although ss occurs in all age groups, the average age of onset is between ages 40 and 60, although as many as half of all cases may be left undiagnosed or unreported. the prevalence of ss generally increases with age.ss is reported in 30-50% of people with rheumatoid arthritis and in 10-25% with systemic lupus erythematosus.


== history ==
jan mikulicz-radecki (1850–1905) is generally credited with the first description of ss. in 1892, he described a 42-year-old man with enlargement of the parotid and lacrimal glands associated with a round-cell infiltrate and acinar atrophy. however, the criteria that mikulicz established for diagnosis often led to misdiagnosis of mikulicz's syndrome. many conditions, such as tuberculosis, infections, sarcoidosis and lymphoma present with similar conditions to those ascribed to mikulicz's syndrome. nevertheless, the term ""mikulicz’s syndrome"" is still used occasionally to describe the appearance of lymphocytic infiltrates on salivary-gland biopsies.in 1930, henrik sjögren (1899–1986), an ophthalmologist in jönköping, sweden, observed a patient with low secretions from the lacrimal and salivary glands. sjögren introduced the term keratoconjunctivitis sicca for the symptom of dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis). in 1933, he published his doctoral thesis describing 19 females, most of whom were postmenopausal and had arthritis, showing clinical and pathological manifestations of the syndrome. sjögren clarified that keratoconjunctivitis sicca, resulting from water deficiency, had no relation to xerophthalmia, resulting from vitamin a deficiency. sjögren's thesis was not well received as the board of examiners criticized some clinical aspects.after extensive research and data collection, sjögren published an essential paper in 1951, describing 80 patients with keratoconjunctivitis sicca, 50 of whom also had arthritis. his subsequent follow-up conference trips pertaining to his paper led to an international interest in ss. the term ""keratoconjunctivitis sicca"" was coined by sjögren himself and began to be identified as ss in literature, although it can now have more general usage.


== research ==

research into multifactorial autoimmune diseases such as ss focuses on expanding the knowledge surrounding the disorder, improving diagnostic tools and finding ways to prevent, manage and cure the disorder. the united kingdom primary sjögren's syndrome registry, a tissue biobank of samples taken for research, supported by the medical research council, uk, was established in 2010. it supports clinical trials and genetic studies of ss and is open to those wishing to participate in research studies and to researchers studying the disease.as an autoimmune disease, susceptibility to ss is greatly influenced by the human leukocyte antigen. dqa1*05:01, dqb1*02:01, and drb1*03:01 alleles were identified as risk factors, while dqa1*02:01, dqa1*03:01 and dqb1*05:01 alleles were found to be protective factors for the disease. the relationship between alleles and specific race was also established. hla-dq2 and hla-b8 are generally found in caucasian patients, while hla-dr5 is related to greek and israeli patients. multiple genome-wide association scans may be conducted in the future to identify key risk variants.viruses that have been associated with sjogren's syndrome include human t-lymphotropic virus type 1 (htlv-1), epstein-barr virus (ebv), human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), hepatitis delta virus (hdv) and hepatitis c virus (hcv).some research has showed that the lack of vitamin a and vitamin d are associated with the disease. vitamin d deficiency was found to be related to neurological manifestations and the presence of lymphoma among patients, but vitamin a levels were inversely associated with extraglandular manifestations of the disease.saliva is a potential diagnostic tool for ss because the salivary component is changed after onset of the disease. with the new miniaturization technology, called lab on a chip, the diagnosis can be more convenient.with regard to therapeutics, multiple monoclonal antibodies were under investigation in 2007. the most promising seemed to be the anti-cd20 rituximab and the anti-cd22 epratuzumab, while the anti-tnf-α and ifn-α seemed less effective.in 2014, the sjögren's syndrome foundation announced a five-year goal to halve the disease's average time to diagnosis.

rifamycin o,reagent,"the rifamycins are a group of antibiotics that are synthesized either naturally by the bacterium amycolatopsis rifamycinica or artificially. they are a subclass of the larger family of ansamycins.  rifamycins are particularly effective against mycobacteria, and are therefore used to treat tuberculosis, leprosy, and mycobacterium avium complex (mac) infections.
the rifamycin group includes the ""classic"" rifamycin drugs as well as the rifamycin derivatives rifampicin (or rifampin), rifabutin, rifapentine, rifalazil and rifaximin. rifamycin, sold under the trade name aemcolo, is approved in the united states for treatment of travelers' diarrhea in some circumstances.


== bacterium ==
streptomyces mediterranei was first isolated in 1957 from a soil sample collected near the beach-side town of st raphael in southern france. the name was originally given by two microbiologists working with the italian drug company group lepetit spa in milan, the italian grazia beretta, and pinhas margalith of israel.in 1969, the bacterium was renamed nocardia mediterranei when another scientist named thiemann found that it has a cell wall typical of the nocardia species. then, in 1986, the bacterium was renamed again amycolatopsis mediterranei, as the first species of a new genus, because a scientist named lechevalier discovered that the cell wall lacks mycolic acid and is not able to be infected by the nocardia and rhodococcus phages.
based on 16s ribosomal rna sequences, bala et al. renamed the species in 2004 amycolatopsis rifamycinica.


== first drugs ==
rifamycins were first isolated in 1957 from a fermentation culture of streptomyces mediterranei at the laboratory of gruppo lepetit spa in milan by two scientist named piero sensi and maria teresa timbal, working with the israeli scientist pinhas margalith. initially, a family  of closely related antibiotics was discovered referred to as  rifamycin a, b, c, d, e. the only component of this mixture sufficiently stable to isolate in a pure form was rifamycin b, which unfortunately was poorly active. however, further studies showed that while rifamycin b was essentially inactive, it was spontaneously oxidized and hydrolyzed in aqueous solutions to yield the highly active rifamycin s. simple reduction of rifamycin s yielded the hydroquinone form called rifamycin sv, which became the first member of this class to enter clinical use as an intravenous antibiotic. further chemical modification of rifamycin sv yielded an improved analog rifamide, which was also introduced into clinical practice, but was similarly limited to intravenous use. after an extensive modification program, rifampin was eventually produced, which is orally available and has become a mainstay of tuberculosis therapy

lepetit filed for patent protection of rifamycin b in the uk in august 1958, and in the us in march 1959. the british patent gb921045 was granted in march 1963, and u.s. patent 3,150,046 was granted in september 1964. the drug is widely regarded as having helped conquer the issue of drug-resistant tuberculosis in the 1960s.


== clinical trials ==
rifamycins have been used for the treatment of many diseases, the most important one being hiv-related tuberculosis. a systematic review of clinical trials on alternative regimens for prevention of active tuberculosis in hiv-negative individuals with latent tb found that a weekly, directly observed regimen of rifapentine with isoniazid for three months was as effective as a daily, self-administered regimen of isoniazid for nine months. but the rifapentine-isoniazid regimen had higher rates of treatment completion and lower rates of hepatotoxicity. however, the rate of treatment-limiting adverse events was higher in the rifapentine-isoniazid regimen.the rifamycins have  a unique mechanism of action, selectively inhibiting bacterial dna-dependent rna polymerase, and show no cross-resistance with other antibiotics in clinical use. however, despite their activity against bacteria resistant to other antibiotics, the rifamycins themselves suffer from a rather high frequency of resistance. because of this, rifampin  and other rifamycins are typically  used in  combination with other antibacterial drugs. this is routinely practiced in tb therapy and serves to prevent the formation of mutants that are resistant to any of the drugs in the combination. rifampin rapidly kills fast-dividing bacilli strains as well as “persisters” cells, which remain biologically inactive for long periods of time that allow them to evade antibiotic activity.  in addition, rifabutin and rifapentine have both been used against tuberculosis acquired in hiv-positive patients. although tuberculosis therapy remains the most important use of rifampin, an increasing  problem with serious multiple drug resistant bacterial infections has led to some  use of antibiotic combinations containing rifampin to treat them.


== mechanism of action ==
the antibacterial activity of rifamycins relies on the inhibition of bacterial dna-dependent rna synthesis.  this is due to the high affinity of rifamycins for the  prokaryotic rna polymerase. the selectivity of the rifamycins depends on the fact that they have a very poor affinity for  the analogous mammalian enzyme.  crystal structure data of the antibiotic bound to rna polymerase indicates that rifamycin blocks synthesis by causing strong steric clashes with the growing oligonucleotide (""steric-occlusion"" mechanism).  if rifamycin binds the polymerase after the chain extension process has started, no inhibition is observed on the biosynthesis, consistent with a steric-occlusion mechanism. single step high level resistance to the rifamycins occurs as the result of a single amino acid change in the bacterial dna dependent rna polymerase.


== biosynthesis ==
the first information on the biosynthesis of the rifamycins came from studies using the stable isotope carbon-13 and nmr spectroscopy to establish the origin of the carbon skeleton. these studies showed that the ansa chain was derived from acetate and propionate, in common with other polyketide antibiotics. the naphthalenic chromophore was shown to derive from a propionate unit coupled with a seven carbon amino moiety of unknown origin. the general scheme of biosynthesis starts with the uncommon starting unit, 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (ahba), via type i polyketide pathway (pks i) in which chain extension is performed using 2 acetate and 8 propionate units.  ahba is believed to have originated from the shikimate pathway, however this was not incorporated into the biosynthetic mechanism.  this is due to the observation that 3 amino-acid analogues converted into ahba in cell-free extracts of  a. mediterranei.

the rif cluster is responsible for the biosynthesis of rifamycins.  it contains genes rifg through rifn, which were shown to biosynthesize ahba.[10]  rifk, rifl, rifm, and rifn are believed to act as transaminases in order to form the ahba precursor kanosamine.  ""rifh"" encodes aminodahp synthase that catalyzes the condensation between 1-deoxy-1-imino-d-erythrose 4-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate.  rifa through rife encode a type i polyketide synthase module, with the loading module being a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase.  in all, rifa-e assemble a linear undecaketide and are followed by riff, which encodes an amide synthase and causes the undecaketide to release and form a macrolactam structure.  moreover, the rif cluster contains various regulatory proteins and glycosylating genes that appear to be silent.  other types of genes seem to perform post-synthase modifications of the original polyketide.


== derivatives ==
lepetit introduced rifampicin, an orally active rifamycin, around 1966. rifabutin, a derivative of rifamycin s, was invented around 1975 and came on to the us market in 1993. hoechst marion roussel (now part of aventis) introduced rifapentine in 1999.
rifaximin is an oral rifamycin marketed in the us by salix pharmaceuticals that is poorly absorbed from the intestine.  it has been used to treat hepatic encephalopathy and traveler's diarrhea.

chlorpheniramine pellet,drug,"lecithin (, from the greek lekithos ""yolk"") is a generic term to designate any group of yellow-brownish fatty substances occurring in animal and plant tissues which are amphiphilic – they attract both water and fatty substances (and so are both hydrophilic and lipophilic), and are used for smoothing food textures, emulsifying, homogenizing liquid mixtures, and repelling sticking materials.lecithins are mixtures of glycerophospholipids including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidic acid.lecithin was first isolated in 1845 by the french chemist and pharmacist théodore gobley. in 1850, he named the phosphatidylcholine lécithine. gobley originally isolated lecithin from egg yolk—λέκιθος lekithos is ""egg yolk"" in ancient greek—and established the complete chemical formula of phosphatidylcholine in 1874; in between, he had demonstrated the presence of lecithin in a variety of biological matters, including venous blood, in human lungs, bile, human brain tissue, fish eggs, fish roe, and chicken and sheep brain.
lecithin can easily be extracted chemically using solvents such as hexane, ethanol, acetone, petroleum ether or benzene; or extraction can be done mechanically. it is usually available from sources such as egg yolk, marine sources, soybeans,  milk, rapeseed, cottonseed, and sunflower oil. it has low solubility in water, but is an excellent emulsifier. in aqueous solution, its phospholipids can form either liposomes, bilayer sheets, micelles, or lamellar structures, depending on hydration and temperature. this results in a type of surfactant that usually is classified as amphipathic. lecithin is sold as a food additive and dietary supplement. in cooking, it is sometimes used as an emulsifier and to prevent sticking, for example in non-stick cooking spray.


== production ==
commercial lecithin, as used by food manufacturers, is a mixture of phospholipids in oil. the lecithin can be obtained by water degumming the extracted oil of seeds. it is a mixture of various phospholipids, and the composition depends on the origin of the lecithin. a major source of lecithin is soybean oil. because of the eu requirement to declare additions of allergens in foods, in addition to regulations regarding genetically modified crops, a gradual shift to other sources of lecithin (such as sunflower lecithin) is taking place. the main phospholipids in lecithin from soy and sunflower are phosphatidyl choline, phosphatidyl inositol, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidic acid. they often are abbreviated to pc, pi, pe, ps and pa, respectively. purified phospholipids are produced by companies commercially.


=== hydrolysed lecithin ===
to modify the performance of lecithin to make it suitable for the product to which it is added, it may be hydrolysed enzymatically. in hydrolysed lecithins, a portion of the phospholipids have one fatty acid removed by phospholipase. such phospholipids are called lysophospholipids. the most commonly used phospholipase is phospholipase a2, which removes the fatty acid at the c2 position of glycerol. lecithins may also be modified by a process called fractionation. during this process, lecithin is mixed with an alcohol, usually ethanol. some phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine, have good solubility in ethanol, whereas most other phospholipids do not dissolve well in ethanol. the ethanol is separated from the lecithin sludge, after which the ethanol is removed by evaporation to obtain a phosphatidylcholine-enriched lecithin fraction.


=== genetically modified crops as a source of lecithin ===
as described above, lecithin is highly processed. therefore, genetically modified (gm) protein or dna from the original gm crop from which it is derived often is undetectable – in other words, it is not substantially different from lecithin derived from non-gm crops. nonetheless, consumer concerns about genetically modified food have extended to highly purified derivatives from gm food, such as lecithin. this concern led to policy and regulatory changes in the eu in 2000, when commission regulation (ec) 50/2000 was passed which required labelling of food containing additives derived from gmos, including lecithin. because it is nearly impossible to detect the origin of derivatives such as lecithin, the european regulations require those who wish to sell lecithin in europe to use a meticulous, but essential system of identity preservation (ip).


== properties and applications ==

lecithins have emulsification and lubricant properties, and are a surfactant. they can be completely metabolized (see inositol) by humans, so are well tolerated by humans and nontoxic when ingested; some other emulsifiers can only be excreted via the kidneys.the major components of commercial soybean-derived lecithin are:
33–35% soybean oil
20–21% phosphatidylinositols
19–21% phosphatidylcholine
8–20% phosphatidylethanolamine
5–11% other phosphatides
5% free carbohydrates
2–5% sterols
1% moisturelecithin is used for applications in human food, animal feed, pharmaceuticals, paints, and other industrial applications.
applications include:

in the pharmaceutical industry, it acts as a wetting agent, stabilizing agent and a choline enrichment carrier, helps in emulsification and encapsulation, and is a good dispersing agent. it can be used in manufacture of intravenous fat infusions and for therapeutic use.
in animal feed, it enriches fat and protein and improves pelletization.
in the paint industry, it forms protective coatings for surfaces with painting and printing ink, has antioxidant properties, helps as a rust inhibitor, is a colour-intensifying agent, catalyst, conditioning aid modifier, and dispersing aid; it is a good stabilizing and suspending agent, emulsifier, and wetting agent, helps in maintaining uniform mixture of several pigments, helps in grinding of metal oxide pigments, is a spreading and mixing aid, prevents hard settling of pigments, eliminates foam in water-based paints, and helps in fast dispersion of latex-based paints.
lecithin also may be used as a release agent for plastics, an antisludge additive in motor lubricants, an antigumming agent in gasoline, and an emulsifier, spreading agent, and antioxidant in textile, rubber, and other industries.


=== food additive ===
the nontoxicity of lecithin leads to its use with food, as an additive or in food preparation. it is used commercially in foods requiring a natural emulsifier or lubricant.
in confectionery, it reduces viscosity, replaces more expensive ingredients, controls sugar crystallization and the flow properties of chocolate, helps in the homogeneous mixing of ingredients, improves shelf life for some products, and can be used as a coating. in emulsions and fat spreads, such as margarines with a high fat content of more than 75%, it stabilizes emulsions, reduces spattering (splashing and scattering of oil droplets) during frying, improves texture of spreads and flavor release. in doughs and baking, it reduces fat and egg requirements, helps even out distribution of ingredients in dough, stabilizes fermentation, increases volume, protects yeast cells in dough when frozen, and acts as a releasing agent to prevent sticking and simplify cleaning. it improves wetting properties of hydrophilic powders (such as low-fat proteins) and lipophilic powders (such as cocoa powder), controls dust, and helps complete dispersion in water. lecithin keeps cocoa and cocoa butter in a candy bar from separating. it can be used as a component of cooking sprays to prevent sticking and as a releasing agent.
lecithin is approved by the united states food and drug administration for human consumption with the status ""generally recognized as safe"".  lecithin is admitted by the eu as a food additive, designated as e322.


=== dietary supplement ===
because it contains phosphatidylcholines, lecithin is a source of choline, an essential nutrient.  clinical studies have shown benefit in acne, in improving liver function, and in lowering cholesterol, but older clinical studies in dementia and dyskinesias had found no benefit.an earlier study using a small sample (20 men divided in 3 groups) did not detect statistically significant short term (2–4 weeks) effects on cholesterol in hyperlipidemic men.la leche league recommends its use to prevent blocked or plugged milk ducts which can lead to mastitis in breastfeeding women.egg-derived lecithin is not usually a concern for those allergic to eggs since commercially available egg lecithin is highly purified and devoid of allergy-causing egg proteins. similarly, soy lecithin does not contain enough allergenic proteins for most people allergic to soy, although the us fda only exempts a few soy lecithin products from its mandatory allergenic source labeling requirements.


=== religious restrictions ===
soy-derived lecithin is considered by some to be kitniyot and prohibited on passover for ashkenazi jews when many grain-based foods are forbidden, but not at other times. this does not necessarily affect sephardi jews, who do not have the same restrictions on rice and kitniyot during passover.muslims are not forbidden to eat lecithin per se; however, since it may be derived from animal as well as plant sources, care must be taken to ensure this source is halal. lecithin derived from plants and egg yolks is permissible, as is that derived from animals slaughtered according to the rules of dhabihah.


== research ==
research suggests soy-derived lecithin has significant effects on lowering serum cholesterol and triglycerides, while increasing hdl (""good cholesterol"") levels in the blood of rats. however, a growing body of evidence indicates the phosphatidylcholine in lecithin is converted by gut bacteria into trimethylamine n-oxide (tmao), which is absorbed by the gut and may with time contribute to atherosclerosis and heart attacks. there is also some preliminary evidence suggesting that excessive consumption of lecithin, either via foodstuffs or supplements, may promote depression in sensitive individuals.

triamcinolone inhalant powder,drug,"glucocorticoids (or, less commonly, glucocorticosteroids) are a class of corticosteroids, which are a class of steroid hormones. glucocorticoids are corticosteroids that bind to the glucocorticoid receptor  that is present in almost every vertebrate animal cell. the name ""glucocorticoid"" is a portmanteau (glucose + cortex + steroid) and is composed from its role in regulation of glucose metabolism, synthesis in the adrenal cortex, and its steroidal structure (see structure to the right).
glucocorticoids are part of the feedback mechanism in the immune system, which reduces certain aspects of immune function, such as inflammation. they are therefore used in medicine to treat diseases caused by an overactive immune system, such as allergies, asthma, autoimmune diseases, and sepsis. glucocorticoids have many diverse (pleiotropic) effects, including potentially harmful side effects, and as a result are rarely sold over the counter. they also interfere with some of the abnormal mechanisms in cancer cells, so they are used in high doses to treat cancer. this includes inhibitory effects on lymphocyte proliferation, as in the treatment of lymphomas and leukemias, and the mitigation of side effects of anticancer drugs.
glucocorticoids affect cells by binding to the glucocorticoid receptor. the activated glucocorticoid receptor-glucocorticoid complex up-regulates the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins in the nucleus (a process known as transactivation) and represses the expression of proinflammatory proteins in the cytosol by preventing the translocation of other transcription factors from the cytosol into the nucleus (transrepression).glucocorticoids are distinguished from mineralocorticoids and sex steroids by their specific receptors, target cells, and effects. in technical terms, ""corticosteroid"" refers to both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids (as both are mimics of hormones produced by the adrenal cortex), but is often used as a synonym for ""glucocorticoid"". glucocorticoids are chiefly produced in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex, whereas mineralocorticoids are synthesized in the zona glomerulosa.
cortisol (or hydrocortisone) is the most important human glucocorticoid. it is essential for life, and it regulates or supports a variety of important cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic, and homeostatic functions. various synthetic glucocorticoids are available; these are widely utilized in general medical practice and numerous specialties either as replacement therapy in glucocorticoid deficiency or to suppress the immune system.


== effects ==

glucocorticoid effects may be broadly classified into two major categories: immunological and metabolic.  in addition, glucocorticoids play important roles in fetal development and body fluid homeostasis.


=== immune ===
as discussed in more detail below, glucocorticoids function through interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor:

up-regulate the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins.
down-regulate the expression of proinflammatory proteins.glucocorticoids are also shown to play a role in the development and homeostasis of t lymphocytes. this has been shown in transgenic mice with either increased or decreased sensitivity of t cell lineage to glucocorticoids.


=== metabolic ===
the name ""glucocorticoid"" derives from early observations that these hormones were involved in glucose metabolism. in the fasted state, cortisol stimulates several processes that collectively serve to increase and maintain normal concentrations of glucose in blood.
metabolic effects:

stimulation of gluconeogenesis, in particular, in the liver: this pathway results in the synthesis of glucose from non-hexose substrates, such as amino acids and glycerol from triglyceride breakdown, and is particularly important in carnivores and certain herbivores. enhancing the expression of enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis is probably the best-known metabolic function of glucocorticoids.
mobilization of amino acids from extrahepatic tissues: these serve as substrates for gluconeogenesis.
inhibition of glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue: a mechanism to conserve glucose
stimulation of fat breakdown in adipose tissue: the fatty acids released by lipolysis are used for production of energy in tissues like muscle, and the released glycerol provide another substrate for gluconeogenesis.
increase in sodium retention and potassium excretion leads to hypernatremia and hypokalemia
increase in hemoglobin concentration, likely due to hindrance of the ingestion of red blood cell by macrophage or other phagocyte.
increased urinary uric acid
increased urinary calcium and hypocalcemia
alkalosis
leukocytosisexcessive glucocorticoid levels resulting from administration as a drug or hyperadrenocorticism have effects on many systems. some examples include inhibition of bone formation, suppression of calcium absorption (both of which can lead to osteoporosis), delayed wound healing, muscle weakness, and increased risk of infection. these observations suggest a multitude of less-dramatic physiologic roles for glucocorticoids.


=== developmental ===
glucocorticoids have multiple effects on fetal development. an important example is their role in promoting maturation of the lung and production of the surfactant necessary for extrauterine lung function. mice with homozygous disruptions in the corticotropin-releasing hormone gene (see below) die at birth due to pulmonary immaturity. in addition, glucocorticoids are necessary for normal brain development, by initiating terminal maturation, remodeling axons and dendrites, and affecting cell survival and may also play a role in hippocampal development. glucocorticoids stimulate the maturation of the na+/k+/atpase, nutrient transporters, and digestion enzymes, promoting the development of a functioning gastro-intestinal system. glucocorticoids also support the development of the neonate's renal system by increasing glomerular filtration.


=== arousal and cognition ===

glucocorticoids act on the hippocampus, amygdala, and frontal lobes. along with adrenaline, these enhance the formation of flashbulb memories of events associated with strong emotions, both positive and negative. this has been confirmed in studies, whereby blockade of either glucocorticoids or noradrenaline activity impaired the recall of emotionally relevant information. additional sources have shown subjects whose fear learning was accompanied by high cortisol levels had better consolidation of this memory (this effect was more important in men). the effect that glucocorticoids have on memory may be due to damage specifically to the ca1 area of the hippocampal formation.  in multiple animal studies, prolonged stress (causing prolonged increases in glucocorticoid levels) have shown destruction of the neurons in this area of the brain, which has been connected to lower memory performance.glucocorticoids have also been shown to have a significant impact on vigilance (attention deficit disorder) and cognition (memory). this appears to follow the yerkes-dodson curve, as studies have shown circulating levels of glucocorticoids vs. memory performance follow an upside-down u pattern, much like the yerkes-dodson curve. for example, long-term potentiation (ltp; the process of forming long-term memories) is optimal when glucocorticoid levels are mildly elevated, whereas significant decreases of ltp are observed after adrenalectomy (low-glucocorticoid state) or after exogenous glucocorticoid administration (high-glucocorticoid state). elevated levels of glucocorticoids enhance memory for emotionally arousing events, but lead more often than not to poor memory for material unrelated to the source of stress/emotional arousal. in contrast to the dose-dependent enhancing effects of glucocorticoids on memory consolidation, these stress hormones have been shown to inhibit the retrieval of already stored information. long-term exposure to glucocorticoid medications, such as asthma and anti-inflammatory medication, has been shown to create deficits in memory and attention both during and, to a lesser extent, after treatment, a condition known as ""steroid dementia"".


=== body fluid homeostasis ===
glucocorticoids could act centrally, as well as peripherally, to assist in the normalization of extracellular fluid volume by regulating body's action to atrial natriuretic peptide (anp). centrally, glucocorticoids could inhibit dehydration induced water intake; peripherally, glucocorticoids could induce a potent diuresis.


== mechanism of action ==


=== transactivation ===
glucocorticoids bind to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor, a type of nuclear receptor that is activated by ligand binding. after a hormone binds to the corresponding receptor, the newly formed complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to glucocorticoid response elements in the promoter region of the target genes resulting in the regulation of gene expression. this process is commonly referred to as transcriptional activation, or transactivation.the proteins encoded by these up-regulated genes have a wide range of effects, including, for example:
anti-inflammatory – lipocortin i, p11/calpactin binding protein, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor 1 (slpi), and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase (mapk phosphatase)
increased gluconeogenesis – glucose 6-phosphatase and tyrosine aminotransferase


=== transrepression ===
the opposite mechanism is called transcriptional repression, or transrepression.  the classical understanding of this mechanism is that activated glucocorticoid receptor binds to dna in the same site where another transcription factor would bind, which prevents the transcription of genes that are transcribed via the activity of that factor.  while this does occur, the results are not consistent for all cell types and conditions; there is no generally accepted, general mechanism for transrepression.new mechanisms are being discovered where transcription is repressed, but the activated glucocorticoid receptor is not interacting with dna, but rather with another transcription factor directly, thus interfering with it, or with other proteins that interfere with the function of other transcription factors.  this latter mechanism appears to be the most likely way that activated glucocorticoid receptor interferes with nf-κb - namely by recruiting histone deacetylase, which deacetylate the dna in the promoter region leading to closing of the chromatin structure where nf-κb needs to bind.


=== nongenomic effects ===
activated glucocorticoid receptor has effects that have been experimentally shown to be independent of any effects on transcription and can only be due to direct binding of activated glucocorticoid receptor with other proteins or with mrna.for example, src kinase which binds to inactive glucocorticoid receptor, is released when a glucocorticoid binds to glucocorticoid receptor, and phosphorylates a protein that in turn displaces an adaptor protein from a receptor important in inflammation, epidermal growth factor, reducing its activity, which in turn results in reduced creation of arachidonic acid - a key proinflammatory molecule.  this is one mechanism by which glucocorticoids have an anti-inflammatory effect.


== pharmacology ==

a variety of synthetic glucocorticoids, some far more potent than cortisol, have been created for therapeutic use. they differ in both pharmacokinetics (absorption factor, half-life, volume of distribution, clearance) and pharmacodynamics (for example the capacity of mineralocorticoid activity: retention of sodium (na+) and water; renal physiology). because they permeate the intestines easily, they are administered primarily per os (by mouth), but also by other methods, such as topically on skin. more than 90% of them bind different plasma proteins, though with a different binding specificity. endogenous glucocorticoids and some synthetic corticoids have high affinity to the protein transcortin (also called corticosteroid-binding globulin), whereas all of them bind albumin. in the liver, they quickly metabolize by conjugation with a sulfate or glucuronic acid, and are secreted in the urine.
glucocorticoid potency, duration of effect, and the overlapping mineralocorticoid potency vary. cortisol is the standard of comparison for glucocorticoid potency. hydrocortisone is the name used for pharmaceutical preparations of cortisol.
the data below refer to oral administration. oral potency may be less than parenteral potency because significant amounts (up to 50% in some cases) may not reach the circulation. fludrocortisone acetate and deoxycorticosterone acetate are, by definition, mineralocorticoids rather than glucocorticoids, but they do have minor glucocorticoid potency and are included in this table to provide perspective on mineralocorticoid potency.


== therapeutic use ==
glucocorticoids may be used in low doses in adrenal insufficiency. in much higher doses, oral or inhaled glucocorticoids are used to suppress various allergic, inflammatory, and autoimmune disorders. inhaled glucocorticoids are the second-line treatment for asthma. they are also administered as post-transplantory immunosuppressants to prevent the acute transplant rejection and the graft-versus-host disease. nevertheless, they do not prevent an infection and also inhibit later reparative processes.  newly emerging evidence showed that glucocorticoids could be used in the treatment of heart failure to increase the renal responsiveness to diuretics and natriuretic peptides. glucocorticoids are historically used for pain relief in inflammatory conditions. however, corticosteroids show limited efficacy in pain relief and potential adverse events for their use in tendinopathies.


=== physiological replacement ===
any glucocorticoid can be given in a dose that provides approximately the same glucocorticoid effects as normal cortisol production; this is referred to as physiologic, replacement, or maintenance dosing. this is approximately 6–12 mg/m2/day of hydrocortisone (m2 refers to body surface area (bsa), and is a measure of body size; an average man's bsa is 1.9 m2).


=== therapeutic immunosuppression ===

glucocorticoids cause immunosuppression, and the therapeutic component of this effect is mainly the decreases in the function and numbers of lymphocytes, including both b cells and t cells.
the major mechanism for this immunosuppression is through inhibition of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated b cells (nf-κb). nf-κb is a critical transcription factor involved in the synthesis of many mediators (i.e., cytokines) and proteins (i.e., adhesion proteins) that promote the immune response. inhibition of this transcription factor, therefore, blunts the capacity of the immune system to mount a response.glucocorticoids suppress cell-mediated immunity by inhibiting genes that code for the cytokines il-1, il-2, il-3, il-4, il-5, il-6, il-8 and ifn-γ, the most important of which is il-2. smaller cytokine production reduces the t cell proliferation.glucocorticoids, however, not only reduce t cell proliferation, but also lead to another well known effect - glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. the effect is more prominent in immature t cells still inside in the thymus, but peripheral t cells are also affected. the exact mechanism regulating this glucocorticoid sensitivity lies in the bcl-2 gene.glucocorticoids also suppress the humoral immunity, thereby causing a humoral immune deficiency. glucocorticoids cause b cells to express smaller amounts of il-2 and of il-2 receptors. this diminishes both b cell clone expansion and antibody synthesis. the diminished amounts of il-2 also cause fewer t lymphocyte cells to be activated.
the effect of glucocorticoids on fc receptor expression in immune cells is complicated.  dexamethasone decreases ifn-gamma stimulated fc gamma ri expression in neutrophils while conversely causing an increase in monocytes. glucocorticoids may also decrease the expression of fc receptors in macrophages, but the evidence supporting this regulation in earlier studies has been questioned. the effect of fc receptor expression in macrophages is important since it is necessary for the phagocytosis of opsonised cells.  this is because fc receptors bind antibodies attached to cells targeted for destruction by macrophages.


=== anti-inflammatory ===
glucocorticoids are potent anti-inflammatories, regardless of the inflammation's cause; their primary anti-inflammatory mechanism is lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis. lipocortin-1 both suppresses phospholipase a2, thereby blocking eicosanoid production, and inhibits various leukocyte inflammatory events (epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst, etc.). in other words, glucocorticoids not only suppress immune response, but also inhibit the two main products of inflammation, prostaglandins and leukotrienes. they inhibit prostaglandin synthesis at the level of phospholipase a2 as well as at the level of cyclooxygenase/pge isomerase (cox-1 and cox-2), the latter effect being much like that of nsaids, thus potentiating the anti-inflammatory effect.
in addition, glucocorticoids also suppress cyclooxygenase  expression.glucocorticoids marketed as anti-inflammatories are often topical formulations, such as nasal sprays for rhinitis or inhalers for asthma. these preparations have the advantage of only affecting the targeted area, thereby reducing side effects or potential interactions. in this case, the main compounds used are beclometasone, budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone and ciclesonide. in rhinitis, sprays are used. for asthma, glucocorticoids are administered as inhalants with a metered-dose or dry powder inhaler. in rare cases, symptoms of radiation induced thyroiditis has been treated with oral glucocorticoids.


=== hyperaldosteronism ===
glucocorticoids can be used in the management of familial hyperaldosteronism type 1. they are not effective, however, for use in the type 2 condition.


=== resistance ===

resistance to the therapeutic uses of glucocorticoids can present difficulty; for instance, 25% of cases of severe asthma may be unresponsive to steroids. this may be the result of genetic predisposition, ongoing exposure to the cause of the inflammation (such as allergens), immunological phenomena that bypass glucocorticoids, and pharmacokinetic disturbances (incomplete absorption or accelerated excretion or metabolism).


=== heart failure ===
glucocorticoids could be used in the treatment of decompensated heart failure to potentiate renal responsiveness to diuretics, especially in heart failure patients with refractory diuretic resistance with large doses of loop diuretics.


== side effects ==
glucocorticoid drugs currently being used act nonselectively, so in the long run they may impair many healthy anabolic processes. to prevent this, much research has been focused recently on the elaboration of selectively acting glucocorticoid drugs. side effects include:

immunodeficiency (see section below)
hyperglycemia due to increased gluconeogenesis, insulin resistance, and impaired glucose tolerance (""steroid diabetes""); caution in those with diabetes mellitus
increased skin fragility, easy bruising
negative calcium balance due to reduced intestinal calcium absorption
steroid-induced osteoporosis: reduced bone density (osteoporosis, osteonecrosis, higher fracture risk, slower fracture repair)
weight gain due to increased visceral and truncal fat deposition (central obesity) and appetite stimulation; see corticosteroid-induced lipodystrophy
hypercortisolemia with prolonged or excessive use (also known as, exogenous cushing's syndrome)
impaired memory and attention deficits
adrenal insufficiency (if used for long time and stopped suddenly without a taper)
muscle and tendon breakdown (proteolysis), weakness, reduced muscle mass and repair
expansion of malar fat pads and dilation of small blood vessels in skin
lipomatosis within the epidural space
excitatory effect on central nervous system (euphoria, psychosis)
anovulation, irregularity of menstrual periods
growth failure, delayed puberty
increased plasma amino acids, increased urea formation, negative nitrogen balance
glaucoma due to increased ocular pressure
cataracts
topical steroid addictionin high doses, hydrocortisone (cortisol) and those glucocorticoids with appreciable mineralocorticoid potency can exert a mineralocorticoid effect as well, although in physiologic doses this is prevented by rapid degradation of cortisol by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isoenzyme 2 (11β-hsd2) in mineralocorticoid target tissues. mineralocorticoid effects can include salt and water retention, extracellular fluid volume expansion, hypertension, potassium depletion, and metabolic alkalosis.


=== immunodeficiency ===
glucocorticoids cause immunosuppression, decreasing the function and/or numbers of neutrophils, lymphocytes (including both b cells and t cells), monocytes, macrophages, and the anatomical barrier function of the skin. this suppression, if large enough, can cause manifestations of immunodeficiency, including t cell deficiency, humoral immune deficiency and neutropenia.


=== withdrawal ===
in addition to the effects listed above, use of high-dose glucocorticoids for only a few days begins to produce suppression of the patient's adrenal glands suppressing hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone leading to suppressed production of adrenocorticotropic hormone by the anterior pituitary. with prolonged suppression, the adrenal glands atrophy (physically shrink), and can take months to recover full function after discontinuation of the exogenous glucocorticoid.
during this recovery time, the patient is vulnerable to adrenal insufficiency during times of stress, such as illness. while suppressive dose and time for adrenal recovery vary widely, clinical guidelines have been devised to estimate potential adrenal suppression and recovery, to reduce risk to the patient. the following is one example:

if patients have been receiving daily high doses for five days or less, they can be abruptly stopped (or reduced to physiologic replacement if patients are adrenal-deficient). full adrenal recovery can be assumed to occur by a week afterward.
if high doses were used for six to 10 days, reduce to replacement dose immediately and taper over four more days. adrenal recovery can be assumed to occur within two to four weeks of completion of steroids.
if high doses were used for 11–30 days, cut immediately to twice replacement, and then by 25% every four days. stop entirely when dose is less than half of replacement. full adrenal recovery should occur within one to three months of completion of withdrawal.
if high doses were used more than 30 days, cut dose immediately to twice replacement, and reduce by 25% each week until replacement is reached. then change to oral hydrocortisone or cortisone as a single morning dose, and gradually decrease by 2.5 mg each week. when the morning dose is less than replacement, the return of normal basal adrenal function may be documented by checking 0800 cortisol levels prior to the morning dose; stop drugs when 0800 cortisol is 10 μg/dl. predicting the time to full adrenal recovery after prolonged suppressive exogenous steroids is difficult; some people may take nearly a year.
flare-up of the underlying condition for which steroids are given may require a more gradual taper than outlined above.

gerhard franke,non_science,"gerhard franke (24 april 1926 – 22 october 2002) was a german painter.


== biography ==
franke was born in lugau in sachsen and grew up in chemnitz. after completing his abitur, he studied art in leipzig at the
staatlichen akademie für graphische künste und buchgewerbe, where he was a student of elisabeth voigt and then cello at the university of music and theatre leipzig. after a wrist injury that ended his music career, he dedicated himself to painting but soon came into conflict with the repressive east german regime, wanting to do abstract painting, instead of the state sanctioned socialist realism. after years of teaching art at small country schools in thuringia, franke and his wife, ute, established a successful ceramics business in 1966. freed from relying on any official communist support, his abstract work from the 1960s and 70s was often critical of the stasi and depicted primitive, abstract creatures caught in a web of state oppression, thus he never exhibited in the gdr. after german reunification, franke turned toward figurative paintings set in the countryside around the castle of arnshaugk, near neustadt an der orla, where he had lived as a recluse until his death in 2002.

voltage-dependent calcium channel gamma-like subunit (mouse),protein,"the g beta-gamma complex (gβγ) is a tightly bound dimeric protein complex, composed of one gβ and one gγ subunit, and is a component of heterotrimeric g proteins. heterotrimeric g proteins, also called guanosine nucleotide-binding proteins, consist of three subunits, called alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, or gα, gβ, and gγ. when a g protein-coupled receptor (gpcr) is activated, gα dissociates from gβγ, allowing both subunits to perform their respective downstream signaling effects. one of the major functions of gβγ is the inhibition of the gα subunit.


== history ==
the individual subunits of the g protein complex were first identified in 1980 when the regulatory component of adenylate cyclase was successfully purified, yielding three polypeptides of different molecular weights. initially, it was thought that gα, the largest subunit, was the major effector regulatory subunit, and that gβγ was largely responsible for inactivating the gα subunit and enhancing membrane binding. however, downstream signalling effects of gβγ were later discovered when the purified gβγ complex was found to activate a cardiac muscarinic k+ channel. shortly after, the gβγ complex associated with a mating factor receptor-coupled g protein in yeast was found to initiate a pheromone response. although these hypotheses were initially controversial, gβγ has since been shown to directly regulate as many different protein targets as the gα subunit.recently, possible roles of the gβγ complex in retinal rod photoreceptors have been investigated, with some evidence for the maintenance of gα inactivation. however, these conclusions were drawn from in vitro experiments under unphysiological conditions, and the physiological role of the gβγ complex in vision is still unclear. nevertheless, recent in vivo findings demonstrate the necessity of the transducin gβγ complex in the functioning of rod photoreceptors under low light conditions.


== structure ==
the gβγ subunit is a dimer composed of two polypeptides, however it acts functionally as a monomer, as the individual subunits do not separate, and have not been found to function independently.
the gβ subunit is a member of the β-propeller family of proteins, which typically possess 4-8 antiparallel β-sheets arranged in the shape of a propeller. gβ contains a 7 bladed β-propeller, each blade arranged around a central axis and composed of 4 antiparallel β-sheets. the amino acid sequence contains 7 wd repeat motifs of about 40 amino acids, each highly conserved and possessing the trp-asp dipeptide that gives the repeat its name. 
the gγ subunit is considerably smaller than gβ, and is unstable on its own, requiring interaction with gβ to fold, explaining the close association of the dimer. in the gβγ dimer, the gγ subunit wraps around the outside of gβ, interacting through hydrophobic associations, and exhibits no tertiary interactions with itself. the n terminus helical domains of the two subunits form a coiled coil with one another that typically extends away from the core of the dimer. 
to date, 5 β-subunit and 11 γ-subunit genes and have been identified in mammals. the gβ genes have very similar sequences, while significantly greater variation is seen in the gγ genes, indicating that the functional specificity of the gβγ dimer may be dependent on the type of gγ subunit involved.
of additional structural interest is the discovery of a so-called “hotspot” present on the surface of the gβγ dimer; a specific site of the protein that binds to diverse range of peptides and is thought to be a contributing factor in the ability of gβγ to interact with a wide variety of effectors.


=== synthesis and modification ===
synthesis of the subunits occurs in the cytosol. folding of the β-subunit is thought to be aided by the chaperone cct (chaperonin containing tailless-complex polypeptide 1), which also prevents aggregation of folded subunits. a second chaperone, phlp (phosducin-like protein), binds to the cct/gβ complex, and is phosphorylated, allowing cct to dissociate and gγ to bind. finally, phlp is released, exposing the binding site for gα, allowing for formation of the final trimer at the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is targeted to the plasma membrane. gγ subunits are known to be prenylated (covalently modified by the addition of lipid moieties) prior to addition to gβ, which itself has not been found to be modified. this prenylation is thought to be involved in directing the interaction of the subunit both with membrane lipids and other proteins.


== function ==
the gβγ complex is an essential element in the gpcr signaling cascade. it has two main states for which it performs different functions. when gβγ is interacting with gα it functions as a negative regulator. in the heterotrimer form, the gβγ dimer increases the affinity of gα for gdp, which causes the g protein to be in an inactive state. for the gα subunit to become active, the nucleotide exchange must be induced by the gpcr. studies have shown that it is the gβγ dimer that demonstrates specificity for the appropriate receptor and that the gγ subunit actually enhances the interaction of the gα subunit with the gpcr. the gpcr is activated by an extracellular ligand and subsequently activates the g protein heterotrimer by causing a conformational change in the gα subunit. this causes the replacement of gdp with gtp as well as the physical dissociation of the gα and the gβγ complex.
once separated, both gα and gβγ are free to participate in their own distinct signaling pathways. gβγ does not go through any conformational changes when it dissociates from gα and it acts as a signaling molecule as a dimer. the gβγ dimer has been found to interact with many different effector molecules by protein-protein interactions. different combinations of the gβ and gγ subtypes can influence different effectors and work exclusively or synergistically with the gα subunit.gβγ signaling is diverse, inhibiting or activating many downstream events depending on its interaction with different effectors. researchers have discovered that gβγ regulates ion channels, such as g protein-gated inward rectifier channels, as well as calcium channels. in human pbmc, gβγ complex has been shown to activate phosphorylation of erk1/2. another example of gβγ signaling is its effect of activating or inhibiting adenylyl cyclase leading to the intracellular increase or decrease of the secondary messenger cyclic amp. for more examples of gβγ signaling see table. however, the full extent of gβγ signaling has not yet been discovered.


== medical implications ==


=== drug design ===
the gβγ subunit plays a variety of roles in cell signalling processes and as such researchers are now examining its potential as a therapeutic drug target for the treatment of many medical conditions. however, it is recognized that there are a number of considerations to keep in mind when designing a drug which targets the gβγ subunit:

the gβγ  subunit is essential for the formation of heterotrimeric g protein through its association with the gα subunit allowing the g proteins coupling to the gpcr. therefore, any agent inhibiting the gβγ subunits signalling effects must not interfere with the heterotrimeric g protein formation or gα subunit signalling.
gβγ  expression is universal throughout almost all the cells of the body so any agent acting to inhibit this subunit could elicit numerous side effects.
small molecule inhibitors that target the coupling of gβγ  to specific effectors and do not interfere with normal g protein cycling/ heterotrimeric formation, have the potential to work as therapeutic agents in treating some specific diseases.


=== targeting the gβγ subunit in treatment ===
research has been conducted on how altering the actions of gβγ subunits could be beneficial for the treatment of certain medical conditions. gβγ signalling has been examined for its role in a variety of conditions including heart failure, inflammation and leukemia.


==== heart failure ====
heart failure can be characterized by a loss of β adrenergic receptor (βar) signalling in heart cells. when the βar is stimulated by catecholamines such as adrenaline and noradrenaline, there is normally an increase in the contractility of the heart. however, in heart failure there are sustained and elevated levels of catecholamines which result in chronic desensitization of the βar receptor. this leads to a decrease in the strength of heart contractions. some research suggests that this chronic desensitization is due to the over activation of a kinase, g protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (grk2), which phosphorylates and deactivates certain g protein coupled receptors . when the g protein coupled receptor is activated, the gβγ subunit recruits grk2 which then phosphorylates and desensitizes gpcrs like the βar. preventing the interaction of the βγ subunit with grk2 has therefore been studied as a potential target for increasing heart contractile function. the developed molecule grk2ct is a protein inhibitor which inhibits the signalling properties of gβγ subunit but does not interfere with alpha subunit signalling. the over expression of grk2ct has been shown to significantly rescue cardiac function in murine models of heart failure by blocking gβγ subunit signalling. in another study, biopsies were taken from patients with heart failure and virally induced overexpression of grk2ct in the heart myocytes. other tests showed an improvement in cardiac cell contractile function by inhibiting gβγ.


==== inflammation ====
when particular gpcrs are activated by their specific chemokines gβγ directly activates pi3kγ which is involved in the recruitment of neutrophils that contribute to inflammation. it has been discovered that the inhibition of pi3kγ significantly reduces inflammation. pi3kγ is the intended target molecule in the prevention of inflammation as it is the common signalling effector of many different chemokine and receptor types involved in promoting inflammation.  although pi3kγ is the intended target there are other isoforms of pi3 which perform different functions from pi3kγ. since pi3kγ is specifically regulated by gβγ, while other isoforms of pi3 are largely regulated by other molecules, inhibiting gβγ signalling would provide the desired specificity of a therapeutic agent designed to treat inflammation.


==== leukemia ====
the gβγ subunit has been shown to activate a rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (rhogef) gene plekhg2 which is upregulated in a number of leukemia cell lines and mouse models of leukemia. lymphocyte chemotaxis as a result of rac and cdc42 activation as well as actin polymerization is believed to be regulated by the gβγ activated rhogef. therefore, a drug inhibiting the gβγ could play a role in the treatment of leukemia.

dna fragmentation factor subunit beta isoform beta (human),protein,"caspase-activated dnase (cad) or dna fragmentation factor subunit beta is a protein that in humans is encoded by the dffb gene. it breaks up the dna during apoptosis and promotes cell differentiation. it is usually an inactive monomer inhibited by icad. this is cleaved before dimerization.


== function ==
apoptosis is a cell self-destruct process that removes toxic and/or useless cells during mammalian development and other life processes. the apoptotic process is accompanied by shrinkage and fragmentation of the cells and nuclei and degradation of the chromosomal dna into nucleosomal units. dna fragmentation factor (dff) is a heterodimeric protein of 40-kd (dffb) and 45-kd (dffa) subunits. dffa is the substrate for caspase-3 and triggers dna fragmentation during apoptosis. dff becomes activated when dffa is cleaved by caspase-3. the cleaved fragments of dffa dissociate from dffb, the active component of dff. dffb has been found to trigger both dna fragmentation and chromatin condensation during apoptosis. multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene, but the biological validity of some variants has not been determined.

despite this gene being present in every cell, this protein is only expressed in different tissues and cell variety such as pancreas, heart, colon, leukocytes, prostate, ovary, placenta, kidney, spleen and thymus.it is also known as caspase activated nuclease (cpan), dna fragmentation factor 40 (dff-40), dff2 and dffb. besides, there are other nomenclatures as a result of combining the previous ones.


== structure ==
this heterodimer is an endonuclease with a high content of cysteine residues. it remains inactive in growing cells while it is associated with its inhibitor (icad, dna fragmentation factor 45 kda subunit, dffa or dff45) resulting into a complex icad-cad. their dissociation allows dff40 to oligomerize to form a large functional complex which is by itself an active dnase.

it weighs 40 kda. moreover, it contains three domains making up a cad monomer: c1 or n-terminal cad; c2 which conform three separate α chains and, at last, c3 which is the largest and functionally the most important. what is more, combining c3’s amino acids leads to 5 α helices, 4 β lamina and a loop at the catalytic c-terminal which interact with each other. therefore, a cavity (active site) where dna can fit is produced, even though there is another binding region responsible for stable dna complex during its fragmentation.


=== dff45 subunit or icad ===
dffa is encoded by an alternatively encrypted mrnas originating two distinct forms: short (icad-s) and long (icad-l), which act like a specific chaperone ensuring the correct cad's folding besides, it contains two aspartic acid residues (asp117 and asp224) where cad is identified and, consequently, it stays bounded until caspase-3 splits this union.


== activation process ==
per usual in non-apoptotic growing cells caspase activated dnase is held in check inactivated in the cytoplasm thanks to the association with its inhibitor, inhibitor of caspase-activated dnase (icad) also known as dna fragmentation factor 45 kda (dff45).
icad is encoded by alternatively spliced mrnas which generate long (icad-l) and short (icad-s) forms of icad. therefore, icad has a double function; it acts as a cad inhibitor and also as a chaperone for cad synthesis assisting the correct assembly of the protein.icad has two caspase recognition sites at asp117 and asp224. cad release from icad inhibition is achieved by cleavage of icad at these asp residues by the caspase-3.caspase-3 is activated in the apoptotic cell. caspase-3 activation is a cell requirement during early stages of the skeletal myoblast differentiation. its catalytic site involves sulfohydryl group of cys-285 and the imidazole ring of its his-237. the caspase-3 his-237 stabilizes the target aspartate causing the break of the association of icad and cad leaving the endonuclease cad active allowing it to degrade chromosomal dna.
once the inhibitor is released and in order to properly function, two cad monomers need to come together to form a functional dimer that has vertical symmetry.


== interactions ==
dffb has been shown to interact with dffa.


== cell differentiation ==
caspase 3 is responsible for cellular differentiation, although it is unclear how this kind of protein can promote the cell apoptosis. caspase signals resulting from the activation of nuclease cad indicate that the cell differentiation is due to a cad modification in chromatin structure.
cad leads to the initiation of the dna strand breakage, which occurs during terminal differentiation of some cell, such as skeletal muscle cell. targeting of p21 promoter is responsible for inducing cell differentiation, which is promoted by modifying the dna nuclear microenvironment.the cell diversity is originated by cell differentiation, which has been attributed to the activation of specific transcription factors. it also depends on the activity of a protein or a common signal. the factor that seems to induce more cell differentiation is caspase-3 protease. this was identified as the penultimate stage of apoptosis pathways cell.
some studies have shown that this differentiation is due to many cad kinase substrates. referring to the example of skeletal cells, their differentiation is associated to cleavage of the kinase mst1.moreover, it has been seen that cad participates in the formation of genome whose dna breaks during early stages of the cell differentiation. besides, caspase 3 induces dna breaks in the promoter of the factor p21 and this strand breakup is related to p21 gene expression.


== cell apoptotic death ==
the protein caspase dnase is an endonuclease involved in the cell apoptotic process that facilitates the dna breakup. cell apoptotic death is a process executed by cysteine proteases that allows the animals to keep their homeostasis, also regulated by other mechanisms such as the growth and cell differentiation. this biological response is characterized by the chromosomal dna’s degradation in tiny fragments within the nucleus of the cell. after many investigations and research, it was possible to ensure that caspase-activated dnase is the main responsible of this destruction due to a long list of stimuli.
one of the experiments carried out by the investigators in order to prove that theory was based on the introduction of mutated form of this protein inside both tf-1 human cells and jurkat cells, which had already reacted to the usual (not mutated) form of the endonuclease and they had dead of apoptosis. as a result, these cells died taking into account this genetic modification but they did not show dna breakup. this was the key evidence to prove that the cad form is implicated in this part of the process because without its contribution the fragmentation did not take place.later, it was found that the way how this protein induces the dna breakup is explained by its forms cad and icad, which facilitate both the entry and exit in the nucleus of the cell.

povidone-iodine vaginal insert,drug,"epidural administration (from ancient greek ἐπί, ""on, upon"" + dura mater) is a method of medication administration in which a medicine is injected into the epidural space around the spinal cord. the epidural route is used by physicians and nurse anesthetists to administer local anesthetic agents, analgesics, diagnostic medicines such as radiocontrast agents, and other medicines such as glucocorticoids. epidural administration involves the placement of a catheter into the epidural space, which may remain in place for the duration of the treatment. the technique of intentional epidural administration of medication was first described in 1921 by spanish military surgeon fidel pagés. in the united states, over 50% of childbirths involve the use of epidural anesthesia.
epidural anaesthesia causes a loss of sensation, including pain, by blocking the transmission of signals through nerve fibres in or near the spinal cord. for this reason, epidurals are commonly used for pain control during childbirth and surgery. the technique is considered safe and effective for providing pain relief during childbirth and surgery, and is considered more effective and safer than giving pain medication by mouth or through an intravenous line. an epidural injection may also be used to administer steroids for the treatment of inflammatory conditions of the spinal cord. it is not recommended for people with severe bleeding disorders, low platelets, or infections near the intended injection site. severe complications from epidural administration are rare, but can include problems resulting from improper administration, as well as side effects of the medicines administered. the most common complications of epidural injections include bleeding problems, headaches, and inadequate pain control. epidural analgesia during childbirth may also impact the mother's ability to move during labor. very large doses of anesthetics or analgesics may result in respiratory depression.
an epidural injection may be administered at any point of the spine, but most commonly the lumbar spine, below the end of the spinal cord. the specific administration site determines the specific nerves affected, and thus the area of the body from which pain will be blocked. insertion of an epidural catheter consists of threading a needle between bones and ligaments to reach the epidural space without going so far as to puncture the dura mater. saline or air may be used to confirm placement in the epidural space. alternatively, direct imaging of the injection area may be performed with a portable ultrasound or fluoroscopy to confirm correct placement. once placed, medication may be administered in one or more single doses, or may be continually infused over a period of time. when placed properly, an epidural catheter may remain inserted for several days, but is usually removed when the use of less invasive administration methods (such as taking medication by mouth) is a viable alternative.


== uses ==


=== pain relief during childbirth ===
epidural injections are commonly used to provide pain relief (analgesia) during childbirth. this usually involves epidural injection of a local anesthetic and opioids, commonly called an ""epidural"". this is more effective than oral or iv opioids and other common modalities of analgesia in childbirth. after an epidural is administered, a woman may not feel pain, but may still feel pressure.  epidural clonidine is rarely used but has been extensively studied for management of analgesia during labor.epidural analgesia is considered a safer and more effective method of relieving pain in labor as compared to intravenous or oral analgesia. in a 2018 cochrane review of studies which compared epidural analgesia with oral opiates, some advantages of epidural analgesia included better efficacy, fewer instances of naloxone use in newborns, and decreased risk of maternal hyperventilation. some disadvantages of epidurals included an increase in the number of caesarian sections required due to fetal distress, a longer labor, increased need for oxytocin to stimulate uterine contractions, an increased risk of low blood pressure and muscle weakness, as well as fever. however, the review found no difference in overall caesarean delivery rates, and no evidence of negative effects to the baby soon after birth. furthermore, the occurrence of long-term backache was unchanged after epidural use. complications of epidural analgesia are rare, but may include headaches, dizziness, difficulty breathing and seizures for the mother. the child may experience a slow heartbeat, decreased ability to regulate temperature, and potential exposure to the drugs administered to the mother.there is no overall difference in outcomes based on the time the epidural is administered to the mother, specifically no change in the rate of caesarean section, birth which must be assisted by instruments, and duration of labor. there is also no change in the apgar score of the newborn between early and late epidural administration. epidurals other than low-dose ambulatory epidurals also impact the ability of the mother to move during labor. movement such as walking or changing positions may help improve labor comfort and decrease the risk of complications.


=== pain relief during other surgery ===
epidural analgesia has been demonstrated to have several benefits after other surgeries, including decreasing the need for the use of oral or systemic opioids, and reducing the risk of postoperative respiratory problems, chest infections, blood transfusion requirements, and myocardial infarctions. use of epidural analgesia after surgery in place of systemic analgesia is less likely to decrease intestinal motility which would occur with systemic opioid therapy through blockade of the sympathetic nervous system. some surgeries that spinal analgesia may be used in include lower abdominal surgery, lower limb surgery, and perineal surgery.


=== others ===

the injection of steroids into the epidural space is sometimes used to treat nerve root pain, radicular pain and inflammation caused by conditions such as spinal disc herniation, degenerative disc disease, and spinal stenosis. the risk of complications from steroid administration is low and complications are usually minor. the specific drug, dose, and frequency of administration impacts the risk for and severity of complications. complications of epidural steroid administration are similar to the side effects of steroids administered in other manners, and can include higher than normal blood sugar, especially in patients with type 2 diabetes.
an epidural blood patch consists of a small amount of a person's own blood is injected into the epidural space. this is done as a method of sealing a hole or leak in the epidural. the injected blood clots at the site of the puncture and closes the leak. this may be used to treat post-dural-puncture headache and leakage of cerebrospinal fluid due to dural puncture, which occurs in approximately 1.5% of epidural analgesia procedures. a small amount of a person's own blood is injected into the epidural space, which clots and closes the site of puncture.


== contraindications ==
the use of epidural analgesia and anesthetic is considered safe and effective in most situations. epidural analgesia is contraindicated in people who have complications  such as cellulitis near the injection site or severe coagulopathy. in some cases, it may be contraindicated in people with low platelets, increased intracranial pressure, or decreased cardiac output. due to the risk of disease progression, it is also potentially contraindicated in people with preexisting progressive neurologic disease. some heart conditions such as stenosis of the aortic or mitral valves are also a contraindication to the use of epidural administration, as is low blood pressure or hypovolemia. an epidural is generally not used in people who are being administered anticoagulation therapy as it increases the risk of complications from the epidural.


== risks and complications ==
in addition to blocking nerves which carry pain signals, local anesthetics may block nerves which carry other signals, though sensory nerve fibers are more sensitive to the effects of the local anesthetics than motor nerve fibers. for this reason, adequate pain control can usually be attained without blocking the motor neurons, which would cause a loss of muscle control if it occurred. depending on the drug and dose administered, the effects may last only a few minutes or up to several hours. as such, an epidural can provide pain control without as much of an effect on muscle strength. for example, a woman in labor who is being administered continuous analgesia via an epidural may not have impairment to her ability to move. larger doses of medication are more likely to result in side effects. very large doses of some medications can cause paralysis of the intercostal muscles and thoracic diaphragm responsible for breathing, which may lead to respiratory depression or arrest. it may also result in loss of sympathetic nerve input to the heart, which may cause a significant decrease in heart rate and blood pressure. obese people, those who have given birth prior, those with a history of opiate use, or those with cervical dilation of more than 7 cm are at a higher risk of inadequate pain control.
if the dura is accidentally punctured during administration, it may cause cerebrospinal fluid to leak into the epidural space, causing a post-dural-puncture headache. this occurs in approximately 1 in 100 epidural procedures. such a headache may be severe and last several days, or rarely weeks to months, and is caused by a reduction in csf pressure. mild post-dural-puncture headaches may be treated with caffeine and gabapentin, while severe headaches may be treated with an epidural blood patch, though most cases resolve spontaneously with time. less common but more severe complications include subdural hematoma and cerebral venous thrombosis. the epidural catheter may also rarely be inadvertently placed in the subarachnoid space, which occurs in less than 1 in 1000 procedures. if this occurs,  cerebrospinal fluid can be freely aspirated from the catheter, and this is used to detect misplacement. when this occurs, the catheter is withdrawn and replaced elsewhere, though occasionally no fluid may be aspirated despite a dural puncture. if dural puncture is not recognized, large doses of anesthetic may be delivered directly into the cerebrospinal fluid. this may result in a high block, or, more rarely, a total spinal, where anesthetic is delivered directly to the brainstem, causing unconsciousness and sometimes seizures.epidural administrations can also cause bleeding issues, including ""bloody tap"", which occurs in approximately 1 in 30–50 people. this occurs when epidural veins are inadvertently punctured with the needle during the insertion. it is a common occurrence and is not usually considered a problem in people who have normal blood clotting. permanent neurological problems from bloody tap are extremely rare, estimated at less than 0.07% of occurrences. however, people who have a coagulopathy may have a risk of epidural hematoma, and those with thrombocytopenia might bleed more than expected. a 2018 cochrane review found no evidence regarding the effect of platelet transfusions prior to a lumbar puncture or epidural anesthesia for participants that suffer from thrombocytopenia. it is unclear whether major surgery-related bleeding within 24 hours and the surgery-related complications up to 7 days after the procedure are affected by epidural use.rare complications of epidural administration include formation of an epidural abscess (1 in 145,000) or epidural hematoma (1 in 168,000), neurological injury lasting longer than 1 year (1 in 240,000), paraplegia (1 in 250,000), and arachnoiditis, rarely, an epidural may cause death (1 in 100,000).


=== medication-specific ===
if bupivacaine, a medication commonly administered via epidural, is inadvertently administered into a vein, it can cause excitation, nervousness, tingling around the mouth, tinnitus, tremor, dizziness, blurred vision, or seizures as well as central nervous system depression, loss of consciousness, respiratory depression and apnea. bupivacaine intended for epidural administration has been implicated in cardiac arrests resulting in death when accidentally administered into a vein instead of the epidural space. the administration of large doses of opioids into the epidural space may cause itching and respiratory depression. the sensation of needing to urinate is often significantly diminished or completely absent after administration of epidural local anesthetics or opioids. because of this, a urinary catheter is often placed for the duration of the epidural infusion.in many women given epidural analgesia during labor oxytocin is also used to augment uterine contractions. in one study which examined the rate of breastfeeding two days following epidural anesthesia during childbirth, epidural analgesia used in combination with oxytocin resulted in lower maternal oxytocin and prolactin levels in response to breastfeeding on the second day following birth. this results in a decrease in the amount of milk produced.


== technique ==


=== anatomy ===

an epidural is injected into the epidural space, inside the bony spinal canal but just outside the dura. in contact with the inner surface of the dura is another membrane called the arachnoid mater, which contains the cerebrospinal fluid. in adults, the spinal cord terminates around the level of the disc between l1 and l2, while in neonates it extends to l3 but can reach as low as l4. below the spinal cord there is a bundle of nerves known as the cauda equina or ""horse's tail"". hence, lumbar epidural injections carry a low risk of injuring the spinal cord. insertion of an epidural needle involves threading a needle between the bones, through the ligaments and into the epidural space without puncturing the layer immediately below containing csf under pressure.


=== insertion ===

epidural administration is a procedure which requires the person performing the insertion to be technically proficient in order to avoid complications. proficiency may be trained using bananas or other fruits as a model.the person receiving the epidural may be seated, or lying on their side or stomach. the level of the spine at which the catheter is placed depends mainly on the site of intended operation – based on the location of the pain. the iliac crest is a commonly used anatomical landmark for lumbar epidural injections, as this level roughly corresponds with the fourth lumbar vertebra, which is usually well below the termination of the spinal cord. the tuohy needle, designed with a 90-degree curved tip and side hole to redirect the inserted catheter vertically along the axis of the spine, may be inserted in the midline, between the spinous processes. when using a paramedian approach, the tip of the needle passes along a shelf of vertebral bone called the lamina until just before reaching the ligamentum flavum and the epidural space.along with a sudden loss of resistance to pressure on the plunger of the syringe, a slight clicking sensation may be felt by the operator as the tip of the needle breaches the ligamentum flavum and enters the epidural space. saline or air may be used to identify placement in the epidural space. a systematic review from 2014 showed no difference in terms of safety or efficacy between the use of saline and air for this purpose. in addition to the loss of resistance technique, direct imaging of the placement may be used. this may be conducted with a portable ultrasound scanner or fluoroscopy (moving x-ray pictures). after placement of the tip of the needle, a catheter or small tube is threaded through the needle into the epidural space. the needle is then withdrawn over the catheter. the catheter is generally inserted 4–6 cm into the epidural space, and is typically secured to the skin with adhesive tape, similar to an intravenous line.


=== use and removal ===
if a short duration of action is desired, a single dose of medication called a bolus may be administered. thereafter, this bolus may be repeated if necessary provided the catheter remains undisturbed. for a prolonged effect, a continuous infusion of medication may be used. there is some evidence that an automated intermittent bolus technique may provide better pain control than a continuous infusion technique even when the total doses administered are identical. typically, the effects of the epidural block are noted below a specific level or portion of the body, determined by the site of injection. a higher injection may result in sparing of nerve function in the lower spinal nerves. for example, a thoracic epidural performed for upper abdominal surgery may not have any effect on the area surrounding the genitals or pelvic organs.


=== combined spinal-epidural techniques ===

for some procedures where both the rapid onset of a spinal anesthetic and the post-operative analgesic effects of an epidural are desired, both techniques may be used in combination. this is called combined spinal and epidural anesthesia (cse). the spinal anesthetic may be administered in one location, and the epidural at an adjacent location. alternatively, after locating the epidural space with the tuohy needle, a spinal needle may be inserted through the tuohy needle into the subarachnoid space. the spinal dose is then given, the spinal needle withdrawn, and the epidural catheter inserted as normal. this method, known as the ""needle-through-needle"" technique, may be associated with a slightly higher risk of placing the catheter into the subarachnoid space.


== recovery ==
epidural analgesia is generally well tolerated, with recovery time quick after administration is complete and the epidural is removed. the epidural catheter is usually removed when it is possible to safely switch to oral administration of medications, though catheters can safely remain in place for several days with little risk of bacterial infection, particularly if the skin is prepared with a chlorhexidine solution. subcutaneously tunneled epidural catheters may be safely left in place for longer periods, with a low risk of infection or other complications. regardless of the length of use, the effects of a medicine administered epidurally, including numbness if used for analgesia, usually wear off within a few hours of the epidural being stopped, with full recovery of normal function within 24 hours.the use of epidural analgesia during a birth does not have any effect on whether a caesarean section must be performed during future births. epidural analgesia during childbirth also generally has no negative effects on the long term health of the mother or child. use of epidural analgesia versus oral analgesia or no analgesia has no effect on the normal length of hospital stay after childbirth, the only difference being that care must be performed around the epidural insertion site to prevent infection. following epidural analgesia used for gastrointestinal surgery, the time to recovery of normal gastrointestinal function is not significantly different from recovery time after intravenous analgesia. the use of epidural analgesia during cardiac surgeries may shorten the amount of time a person requires ventilator support following surgery, but it is unknown whether it shortens the overall post-surgery hospital stay overall.

the first record of an epidural injection is from 1885, when american neurologist james corning of acorn hall in morristown, nj used the technique to perform a neuraxial blockade. corning inadvertently injected 111 mg of cocaine into the epidural space of a healthy male volunteer, although at the time he believed he was injecting it into the subarachnoid space. following this, in 1901 fernand cathelin first reported intentionally blocking the lowest sacral and coccygeal nerves through the epidural space by injecting local anesthetic through the sacral hiatus. the loss of resistance technique was first described by achile dogliotti in 1933, following which alberto gutiérrez described the hanging drop technique. both techniques are now used to identify when the needle has correctly been placed in the epidural space.in 1921 fidel pagés, a military surgeon from spain, developed the technique of ""single-shot"" lumbar epidural anesthesia, which was later popularized by italian surgeon achille mario dogliotti. later, in 1931 eugen aburel described using a continuous epidural catheter for pain relief during childbirth. in 1941, robert hingson and waldo edwards recorded the use of continuous caudal anesthesia using an indwelling needle, following which they described the use of a flexible catheter for continuous caudal anesthesia in a woman in labor in 1942. in 1947, manuel curbelo described placement of a lumbar epidural catheter, and in 1979, behar reported the first use of an epidural to administer narcotics.


== society and culture ==
some people continue to be concerned that women who are administered epidural analgesia during labor are more likely to require a cesarean delivery, based on older observational studies. however, evidence has shown that the use of epidural analgesia during labor does not have any statistically significant effect on the necessity to perform a cesarean delivery. a 2018 cochrane review found no increase in the rate of caesarean delivery when epidural analgesia was employed. however, epidural analgesia does lengthen the second stage of labor by 15 to 30 minutes, which may increase the risk a delivery must be assisted by instruments.in the united states in 1998, it was reported that over half of childbirths involved the use of epidural analgesia, and by 2008 this had increased to 61% of births. in the united kingdom, epidurals have been offered through the national health service for all women during childbirth since 1980. by 1998, epidural analgesia was used in the uk for almost 25% of childbirths. in japan, most childbirths take place in primary or secondary hospitals in which epidural analgesia is not offered.in some developed countries, over 70% of childbirths involve epidural analgesia. other studies have shown that minority women and immigrants are less likely to receive epidural analgesia during childbirth. even in countries with universal healthcare coverage such as canada, socioeconomic factors such as race, financial stability, and education influence the rate at which women receive epidural analgesia. one survey in 2014 found that over half of pregnant women (79.5%) did not know what epidural analgesia was or what it was used for, while 76.5% of women would utilize epidural analgesia if offered after it was explained to them.

abnormal cell,cell,"a white blood cell differential is a medical laboratory test that provides information about the types and amounts of white blood cells in a person's blood. the test, which is usually ordered as part of a complete blood count (cbc), measures the amounts of the five normal white blood cell types – neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils – as well as abnormal cell types if they are present. these results are reported as percentages and absolute values, and compared against reference ranges to determine whether the values are normal, low, or high. changes in the amounts of white blood cells can aid in the diagnosis of many health conditions, including viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections and blood disorders such as leukemia.
white blood cell differentials may be performed by an automated analyzer – a machine designed to run laboratory tests – or manually, by examining blood smears under a microscope. the test was performed manually until white blood cell differential analyzers were introduced in the 1970s, making the automated differential possible. in the automated differential, a blood sample is loaded onto an analyzer, which samples a small volume of blood and measures various properties of white blood cells to produce a differential count.  the manual differential, in which white blood cells are counted on a stained microscope slide, is now performed to investigate abnormal results from the automated differential, or upon request by the healthcare provider. the manual differential can identify cell types that are not counted by automated methods and detect clinically significant changes in the appearance of white   blood cells.
in 1674, antonie van leeuwenhoek published the first microscopic observations of blood cells. improvements in microscope technology throughout the 18th and 19th centuries allowed the three cellular components of blood to be identified and counted. in the 1870s, paul ehrlich invented a staining technique that could differentiate between each type of white blood cell. dmitri leonidovich romanowsky later modified ehrlich's stain to produce a wider range of colours, creating the romanowsky stain, which is still used to stain blood smears for manual differentials.
automation of the white blood cell differential began with the invention of the coulter counter, the first automated hematology analyzer, in the early 1950s. this machine used electrical impedance measurements to count cells and determine their sizes, allowing white and red blood cells to be enumerated. in the 1970s, two techniques were developed for performing automated differential counts: digital image processing of microscope slides and flow cytometry techniques using light scattering and cell staining. these methods remain in use on modern hematology analyzers.


== medical uses ==
the white blood cell differential is a common blood test that is often ordered alongside a complete blood count. the test may be performed as part of a routine medical examination; to investigate certain symptoms, particularly those suggestive of infection or hematological disorders; or to monitor existing conditions, such as blood disorders and inflammatory diseases.five types of white blood cells are normally found in blood: neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils.  marked shifts in the proportions of these cell types, as measured by the automated or manual differential, can indicate various health conditions. additionally, cell types which do not normally occur in the blood, such as blast cells, can be identified by the manual differential. these cell types may be found in blood disorders and other pathological states. the manual differential can also identify changes in the appearance of white blood cells, such as  reactive lymphocytes, or features such as toxic granulation and vacuolation in neutrophils. the results of the white blood cell differential are reported as percentages and absolute values. absolute counts are usually reported in units of cells per microliter (µl) or 109 cells per liter (l). the result are then compared against reference ranges, which are defined by individual laboratories and may vary due to different patient populations and testing methods.cbc and differential testing is usually performed on venous or capillary blood. capillary blood draws are generally used for infants and individuals whose veins are difficult to access. to prevent clotting, the sample is drawn into a tube containing the anticoagulant compound ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta). tubes containing sodium citrate may be for patients in whom edta causes platelet clumping. the test is performed on whole blood, meaning blood that has not been centrifuged.


== types ==


=== manual differential ===

in a manual differential, a stained blood smear is examined under a microscope and white blood cells are counted and classified based on their appearance. a manual differential is usually performed when the automated differential is flagged for review or when the healthcare provider requests it. if the manual differential shows findings suggestive of certain serious conditions, such as leukemia, the blood smear is referred to a physician (generally a hematologist or pathologist) for confirmation.


==== procedure ====
 a blood smear is prepared by placing a drop of blood on a microscope slide and using a second slide held at an angle to spread the blood and pull it across the slide, forming a ""feathered edge"" consisting of a single layer of cells at the end of the smear. this may be done by hand or using an automated slide maker coupled to a hematology analyzer. the slide is treated with a romanowsky stain, commonly wright's stain or wright-giemsa, and examined under the microscope. the smear is examined in a systematic pattern, scanning from side to side within the feathered edge and counting cells consecutively. the differential is typically performed at 400x or 500x magnification, but 1000x magnification may be used if abnormal cells are present. cells are identified based on their morphologic features, such as the size and structure of their nucleus and the colour and texture of their cytoplasm. this allows abnormal cell types and changes in cellular appearance to be identified. in most cases, the microscopist counts 100 white blood cells, but 200 may be counted for better representation if the white blood cell count is high. the manual differential count produces percentages of each cell type, which can be multiplied by the total white blood cell count from the analyzer to derive the absolute values.the manual differential can be partially automated with digital microscopy software, which uses artificial intelligence to classify white blood cells from photomicrographs of the blood smear. however, this technique requires confirmation by manual review.


==== limitations ====
because relatively few cells are counted in the manual differential, the variability is higher than in automated techniques, especially when cells are present in low amounts. for example, in a sample containing 5 percent monocytes, the manual differential results could be between 1 and 10 percent due to sampling variation. additionally, cell identification is subjective and the accuracy depends on the skills of the person reading the slide. poor blood smear preparation can cause an uneven distribution of white blood cells, resulting in inaccurate counting, and improper staining can impede cell identification. overall, manual differential counts exhibit coefficients of variation (cvs) ranging from 5 to 10 percent, while automated differential counts of normal neutrophils and lymphocytes have cvs of about 3 percent.in leukemias and other hematologic malignancies, the lineage and genetic characteristics of white blood cells have important implications for treatment and prognosis, and the microscopic appearance of the cells is often insufficient for accurate classification. in these cases, other techniques such as immunophenotyping by flow cytometry or special staining can be used to definitively identify the cells.


=== automated differential ===

most hematology analyzers provide a five-part differential, enumerating neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils. some instruments can also count immature granulocytes and nucleated red blood cells. hematology analyzers measure various properties of white blood cells, such as impedance, light scattering parameters, and staining reactions. this data is analyzed and plotted on a scattergram, forming distinct clusters which correspond to white blood cell types. the analyzer counts many more cells than are counted in a manual differential, resulting in improved precision. if abnormal features or cell populations that the analyzer cannot identify are present, the instrument can flag the results for manual blood smear review.


==== procedure ====

common techniques used by hematology analyzers to identify cells include light scattering, coulter counting, and cytochemical staining techniques. some analyzers also use radiofrequency analysis and monoclonal antibody tagging to identify cells. staining techniques used in differential analyzers include staining of myeloperoxidase, an enzyme found in cells of myeloid lineage, and nucleic acids, which are found in higher concentrations in immature cells.a small volume of blood (as low as 150 microliters) is aspirated into the analyzer, where reagents are applied to lyse red blood cells and preserve white blood cells. the sample is diluted and passed into a flow cell, which uses hydrodynamic focusing to isolate single cells for accurate analysis of their properties. various cellular parameters, such as size, complexity and staining reactions, are measured and analyzed to identify cell populations. basophils are often quantified using a reagent that lyses the cytoplasm of other white blood cells but leaves basophils intact. samples that have abnormal results or are suspected to contain abnormal cells are flagged by the analyzer for manual blood smear review.to ensure that results from the automated analyzer are correct, quality control samples are run at least once per day. these are samples with known results that are most often provided by the instrument manufacturer. laboratories compare their differential results to the known values to ensure the instrument is operating correctly. a moving average measurement may also be used, in which the average results for patient samples are measured at certain intervals. assuming that the characteristics of the patient population remain roughly the same over time, the average should remain constant. large shifts in the average value can indicate instrument problems.


==== limitations ====
when immature or abnormal white blood cells are present, automated differential results may be incorrect, necessitating a manual blood smear review. overall, 10 to 25 percent of cbc samples are flagged for manual review by the analyzer. although most abnormal samples are automatically flagged, some may be missed; conversely, analyzers may generate false positive flags when no abnormal cells are present. hematology laboratories compensate for these issues by requiring a smear review when differential or cbc results fall outside certain numerical thresholds, regardless of the presence of analyzer flags. the sensitivity and specificity of analyzer flagging can be determined by comparing analyzer flags to manual differential results.the automated basophil count is notoriously unreliable, often underestimating counts in basophilia and producing falsely elevated results in the presence of abnormal cells. the manual differential is therefore considered the reference method for these cells.analyzers may count nucleated red blood cells, giant and clumped platelets,  and red blood cells containing abnormal hemoglobins (such as hemoglobin s in sickle cell disease) as white blood cells, leading to faulty differential results. automated differential counts on aged specimens may be incorrect due to cellular degeneration.


== cell types and result interpretation ==
 
neutrophil
neutrophils are the most common white blood cells in normal adult blood. when stained with a romanowsky stain, they exhibit a multi-lobed nucleus and pink cytoplasm that contains small purple granules.the neutrophil count is normally higher in newborns and pregnant women than in other groups. outside of these conditions, increased neutrophil counts (neutrophilia) are associated with bacterial infection, inflammation, and various forms of physiological stress. neutrophil counts can become extremely high in response to some infections and inflammatory states, which is termed leukemoid reaction because the high white blood cell count mimics leukemia. neutrophilia may also occur in myeloproliferative disorders.neutropenia, meaning a low neutrophil count, may occur as a response to drug treatment (especially chemotherapy) or in certain infections, such as tuberculosis and gram-negative sepsis. neutropenia also occurs in many hematologic disorders, such as leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, and in a variety of autoimmune and congenital diseases. a neutrophil count below the reference interval may be normal in individuals of certain ethnicities; this is termed benign ethnic neutropenia. very low neutrophil counts are associated with immunosuppression.when stimulated by infection or inflammation, neutrophils may develop abnormal features in their cytoplasm, such as toxic granulation, toxic vacuolation and döhle bodies. these features, which are caused by the release of cytokines, are collectively known as toxic changes.

lymphocyte
lymphocytes, which are the second most common type of white blood cell in adults, are typically small cells with a round, dark nucleus and a thin strip of pale blue cytoplasm. some lymphocytes are larger and contain a few blue granules.increased lymphocyte counts (lymphocytosis) can be caused by viral infections and may also occur after splenectomy. children have higher lymphocyte counts than adults. chronic lymphocytic leukemia presents with an elevated lymphocyte count and abnormal lymphocyte morphology, in which the lymphocytes have extremely dense, clumped nuclei and some cells appear smudged on the blood smear.  low lymphocyte counts (lymphopenia) may be seen in infections such as hiv/aids, influenza and viral hepatitis, as well as in protein-energy malnutrition, acute illnesses and drug reactions.in response to viral infections (especially infectious mononucleosis), lymphocytes may increase greatly in size, developing unusually shaped nuclei and large amounts of dark blue cytoplasm. such cells are referred to as reactive or atypical lymphocytes and when present they are either commented on or counted separately from normal lymphocytes in the manual differential.

monocyte
monocytes are large cells with a curved or folded nucleus and finely granulated, grey-blue cytoplasm that often contains vacuoles. monocytes are the third most common white blood cell after neutrophils and lymphocytes.increased monocyte counts (monocytosis) are seen in chronic infection and inflammation. extremely high monocyte counts, as well as immature forms of monocytes, occur in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and acute leukemias of monocytic origin. monocyte counts may be decreased (monocytopenia) in individuals who are receiving chemotherapy as well as those with aplastic anemia, severe burns, and aids.

eosinophil
eosinophils have large orange granules in their cytoplasm and bi-lobed nuclei. they are found in low amounts in normal blood.elevated eosinophil counts (eosinophilia) are associated with allergic reactions, parasitic infections, and asthma. eosinophil counts may be decreased in pregnancy and in response to physiological stress, inflammation or treatment with certain drugs, such as steroids and epinephrine.
 
basophil
basophils exhibit large, dark purple granules that often cover the cell's nucleus. they are the rarest of the five normal cell types.basophilia and eosinophilia can occur along with other white blood cell abnormalities in chronic myeloid leukemia and other myeloproliferative disorders. an increased basophil count may also be seen in hypersensitivity reactions and after splenectomy. the basophil count may decrease during ovulation, steroid treatment, and periods of physiological stress.
 
band neutrophil
band neutrophils are young forms of neutrophils which lack segmentation of the nucleus. these cells, which are identified by manual counting, are found in low numbers in normal adult blood.a left shift, meaning an increase in band neutrophils or immature granulocytes, can indicate infection, inflammation or bone marrow disorders, although it can also be a normal finding in pregnancy. some laboratories do not separate bands from mature neutrophils in the differential count because the classification is highly subjective and unreliable.
 
immature granulocyte
immature granulocytes are immature forms of neutrophils and other granulocytes (eosinophils and basophils). this classification consists of metamyelocytes, myelocytes and promyelocytes, which may be enumerated separately in the manual differential or reported together as immature granulocytes (ig) by automated methods. immature granulocytes are normally found in the bone marrow, but not in peripheral blood.when present in significant quantities in the blood, immature granulocytes can indicate infection and inflammation,  as well as myeloproliferative disease, leukemia and other conditions affecting the marrow. igs may also be increased in steroid use and pregnancy. chronic myeloid leukemia often presents with a high number of immature granulocytes in the peripheral blood. abnormal promyelocytes with multiple auer rods, called faggot cells, occur in acute promyelocytic leukemia.

blast cell
blast cells are very immature cells that are normally found in the bone marrow, where they develop into mature cells (hematopoiesis) before being released into the blood. they can be identified by their large overall size, deep blue cytoplasm, and large nucleus with fine chromatin and prominent nucleoli.when seen on the blood smear, blast cells are an abnormal finding and may be indicative of acute leukemia or other serious blood disorders. rarely, they may be seen in severe cases of left shift. the presence of auer rods inside blast cells indicates that they are of myeloid origin, which has important implications for leukemia treatment. other morphologic features can provide information about the lineage of blast cells: for example, myeloblasts tend to be large with distinct nucleoli, while lymphoblasts can be smaller with a denser chromatin pattern. however, these features are not diagnostic, and flow cytometry or special staining is generally used to confirm the lineage.

other cells
various other abnormal cells may be present in the blood in certain conditions. for example, lymphoma cells may be found on the manual differential in some cases of lymphoma, and in mast cell leukemia, mast cells, which are normally confined to tissue, circulate in the blood. there is a very rare phenomenon called carcinocythemia in which tumour cells are seen on the peripheral blood smear.


== history ==
before automated cell counters were introduced, cell counts were performed manually; white and red blood cells, and platelets were counted using microscopes. the first person to publish microscopic observations of blood cells was antonie van leeuwenhoek, who reported on the appearance of red cells in a 1674 letter to the proceedings of the royal society of london; jan swammerdam had described red blood cells some years earlier, but had not published his findings at the time. throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, improvements in microscope technology such as achromatic lenses allowed white blood cells and platelets to be counted in unstained samples. in the 1870s, paul ehrlich developed a staining technique that could differentiate between the five white blood cell types. ehrlich's stain used a combination of an acidic and basic dye to stain white and red blood cells simultaneously. dmitri leonidovich romanowsky improved on this technique in the 1890s by using a mixture of eosin and aged methylene blue, which produced a wide range of hues that was not present when either of the stains was used alone. this was termed the romanowsky effect and became the basis for romanowsky staining, the technique that is still used to stain blood smears for manual differentials.by the early years of the 20th century, the white blood cell differential had become a common practice in the united states, but difficulties in interpreting the results cast doubt on the test's utility. in 1906, charles langdon gibson introduced the gibson chart, which compared the total white blood cell count against the neutrophil count to distinguish between ""pyogenic"" and ""non-pyogenic"" conditions and to predict the severity of infections.  around the same time, josef arneth proposed a system of classifying neutrophils by their number of nuclear lobes – termed the ""lobe index"" or arneth count – and established a set of reference ranges for neutrophil lobularity. arneth's analysis of neutrophil segmentation was later found to have limited clinical significance, but the association of hypersegmented neutrophils with vitamin b12 and folate deficiency remains accepted. viktor schilling in 1912 proposed a different classification of neutrophils, separating them into ""myelozyten, jugendliche, stabkernige and segmentkernige"" – that is, myelocytes, ""juveniles"" (metamyelocytes), band neutrophils (sometimes called ""stabs""), and mature, fully segmented neutrophils – and remarked on the clinical significance of the neutrophilic left shift in conjunction with the white blood cell count and the presence of toxic changes. schilling's monograph, das blutbild und seine klinische verwertung (the blood picture and its clinical significance), was translated into english in 1926, and his neutrophil classification system quickly found acceptance in american laboratories.the first automated hematology analyzer, the coulter counter, was invented in the early 1950s by wallace h. coulter. the analyzer worked on the coulter principle, which states that when cells are suspended in a fluid carrying an electric current and passed through an aperture, they cause decreases in current proportional to their volume because of their poor electrical conductivity. the number and magnitude of these decreases can be used to count blood cells and calculate their sizes. the coulter counter was initially designed for counting red blood cells, but it proved effective for counting white blood cells as well.

after basic cell counting had been automated, the white blood cell differential remained a challenge. research into automating the differential count began in the 1970s and took two main approaches: digital image processing and flow cytometry. using technology developed in the 1950s and 60s to automate the reading of pap smears, several models of image processing analyzers were produced. these instruments would scan a stained blood smear to find cell nuclei, then take a higher resolution snapshot of the cell to analyze it through densitometry. they were expensive, slow, and did little to reduce workload in the laboratory because they still required blood smears to be prepared and stained, so flow cytometry-based systems became more popular, and by 1990, no digital image analyzers were commercially available in the united states or western europe. these techniques enjoyed a resurgence in the 2000s with the introduction of more advanced image analysis platforms using artificial neural networks.early flow cytometry devices shot beams of light at cells in specific wavelengths and measured the resulting absorbance, fluorescence or light scatter, collecting information about the cells' features and allowing cellular contents such as dna to be quantified. one such instrument—the rapid cell spectrophotometer, developed by louis kamentsky in 1965 to automate cervical cytology—could generate blood cell scattergrams using cytochemical staining techniques. leonard ornstein, who had helped to develop the staining system on the rapid cell spectrophotometer, and his colleagues later created the  first commercial flow cytometric white blood cell differential analyzer, the hemalog d. introduced in 1974, this analyzer used light scattering, absorbance and cell staining to identify the five normal white blood cell types in addition to ""large unidentified cells"", a classification that usually consisted of atypical lymphocytes or blast cells. the hemalog d could count 10,000 cells in one run, a marked improvement over the manual differential. 
by 1977 it was estimated that ""at least 200"" automated differential analyzers were in use throughout the world. in 1981, technicon combined the hemalog d with the hemalog-8 analyzer to produce the technicon h6000, the first combined complete blood count and differential analyzer. this analyzer was unpopular with hematology laboratories because it was labour-intensive to operate, but in the late 1980s to early 1990s similar systems were widely produced by other manufacturers such as sysmex, abbott, roche and beckman coulter.

reticular cell of splenic cord,cell,"reticular fibers, reticular fibres or reticulin is a type of fiber in connective tissue composed of type iii collagen secreted by reticular cells. reticular fibers crosslink to form a fine meshwork (reticulin). this network acts as a supporting mesh in soft tissues such as liver, bone marrow, and the tissues and organs of the lymphatic system.


== history ==
the term reticulin was coined in 1892 by m. siegfried.today, the term reticulin or reticular fiber is restricted to referring to fibers composed of type iii collagen. however, during the pre-molecular era, there was confusion in the use of the term reticulin, which was used to describe two structures:

the argyrophilic (silver staining) fibrous structures present in basement membranes
histologically similar fibers present in developing connective tissue.the history of the reticulin silver stain is reviewed by puchtler et al. (1978). the abstract of this paper says:

maresch (1905) introduced bielschowsky's silver impregnation technic for neurofibrils as a stain for reticulum fibers, but emphasized the nonspecificity of such procedures. this lack of specificity has been some confirmed repeatedly. yet, since the 1920s the definition of ""reticulin"" and studies of its distribution were based solely on silver impregnation technics. the chemical mechanism and specificity of this group of stains is obscure. application of gömöri's and wilder's methods to human tissues showed variations of staining patterns with the fixatives and technics employed. besides reticulum fibers, various other tissue structures, e.g. i bands of striated muscle, fibers in nervous tissues, and model substances, e.g. polysaccharides, egg white, gliadin, were also stained. deposition of silver compounds on reticulum fibers was limited to an easily removable substance; the remaining collagen component did not bind silver. these histochemical studies indicate that silver impregnation technics for reticulum fibers have no chemical significance and cannot be considered as histochemical technics for ""reticulin"" or type iii collagen. 


== structure ==
reticular fiber is composed of one or more types of very thin and delicately woven strands of type iii collagen.  these strands build a highly ordered cellular network and provide a supporting network.  many of these types of collagen have been combined with carbohydrate.   thus, they react with silver stains and with periodic acid-schiff reagent but are not demonstrated with ordinary histological stains such as those using hematoxylin. the 1953 science article mentioned above concluded that the reticular and regular collagenous materials contains the same four sugars – galactose, glucose, mannose, and fucose – but in a much greater concentration in the reticular than in the collagenous material.
in a 1993 paper, the reticular fibers of the capillary sheath and splenic cord were studied and compared in the pig spleen by transmission electron microscopy. this paper attempted to reveal their components and the presence of sialic acid in the amorphous ground substance. collagen fibrils, elastic fibers, microfibrils, nerve fibers, and smooth muscle cells were observed in the reticular fibers of the splenic cord. on the other hand, only microfibrils were recognized in the reticular fibers of the capillary sheath. the binding of lfa lectin to the splenic cord was stronger than the capillary sheath. these findings suggested that the reticular fibers of the splenic cord include multiple functional elements and might perform an important role during contraction or dilation of the spleen. on the other hand, the reticular fiber of the capillary sheath resembled the basement membrane of the capillary in its components.
because of their affinity for silver salts, these fibers are called argyrophilic.

agostino carlini,non_science,"augostino carlini or agostino carlini  (c. 1718 – 15 august 1790) was an italian sculptor and painter, who was born in genoa but settled in england. he was also one of the founding members of the royal academy in 1768.


== life ==
he features in a group portrait, by johann zoffany, of the founders, and is one of three sitters (with francesco bartolozzi and giovanni battista cipriani) in a 1777 portrait displayed in the national portrait gallery in london. he was keeper of the royal academy from 1783 until his death in 1790. he exhibited a portrait in oil in 1776.
he worked, with fellow italian sculptor giuseppe ceracchi at somerset house, and on statues at custom house in dublin. he is particularly noted for various church monuments, including a memorial to lady sophia petty at all saints' parish church, high wycombe, buckinghamshire, and one commissioned by joseph damer in 1775 to commemorate his wife caroline, which stands in the north transept of milton abbey in dorset.
also in 1775, carlini was commissioned by dr william hunter, first professor of anatomy at the royal academy schools, to make a cast of the flayed corpse of a recently executed smuggler. the figure was posed as a roman statue, the ""dying gaul"", and given the pseudo-classical title ""smugglerius"".
he died unmarried at carlisle street, london, leaving all his estate to ""elizabeth watton, spinster"", his maid and housekeeper.

clottey rose to prominence by winning his first twenty fights, including 14 by knockout. his performance set him up to fight carlos baldomir, in a title defense by baldomir for the wbc international welterweight title.  clottey was winning until the 10th round, where he was penalized two points for an intentional head butt.  after another clash of heads, clottey was disqualified.
clottey rebounded from the controversial loss by winning the african boxing union welterweight title in his next fight.  he then rolled off a 10 fight winning streak highlighted by his first win on american soil and capture of several minor welterweight and middleweight titles. the streak culminated in an ibf intercontinental welterweight title. on december 2, 2006, clottey earned his first shot at a world title but broke his hand in the fourth round of his fight against world boxing organization champion antonio margarito. that bout against margarito has since come under controversial suspicion following news reports (released after margarito's fight with shane mosley) that margarito had boxed opponents with hand wraps illegally loaded with plaster (along with margarito's first bout with miguel cotto). on april 7, 2007 (following clottey's questionable loss to margarito), clottey earned a unanimous decision over diego corrales, in what was corrales's final fight before his death. in december 2007, clottey positioned himself for another title shot with a win over prospect shamone alvarez. clottey beat zab judah on august 2, 2008, for the ibf welterweight title vacated by antonio margarito.


==== clottey vs. cotto ====
on june 13, 2009, clottey faced miguel cotto in new york city at madison square garden for the wbo welterweight title. cotto dropped clottey in the first with a jab. cotto was cut in the third round by an accidental head butt. clottey's combinations throughout the fight gave cotto problems. cotto emerged the winner with a controversial split decision.


==== clottey vs. pacquiao: the event ====

clottey fought seven-division world champion manny pacquiao on march 13, 2010 in arlington, texas, at the dallas cowboys stadium following the disagreement on terms of a proposed boxing match between manny pacquiao and floyd mayweather jr. which would have been scheduled on the same date in las vegas, nevada. clottey lost to pacquiao by unanimous decision.  pacquiao threw a total of 1231 punches in the fight, missing 985 and landing 246. clottey threw a total of 399 punches, 291 missed and 108 hit manny. on november 19, 2011, after over a year away from the ring, clottey returned to defeat calvin green via tko in the second round. since then however, clottey confirmed that he'd retired from boxing to care for a sick relative.


==== comeback ====
on august 23, 2013, star boxing announced clottey's return to boxing as they have signed the former champion to a contract. clottey returned to the ring on september 14, 2013, when he faced dashon johnson. clottey defeated johnson via unanimous decision. on april 9, 2014, clottey went on to beat former middleweight champion anthony mundine, dropping mundine five times. clottey was in line to fight canelo alvarez in december 2014, but canelo had to pull out due to an ankle injury. on december 19, 2015, clottey faced gabriel rosado at a 158-lb catchweight. despite having success and leading early in the fight, clottey was outworked over ten rounds. he lost via unanimous decision. clottey clarified in february 2018 that he has yet to retire in boxing.


== fighting style ==
a tough, orthodox fighter, clottey has a balanced combination of size, speed, stamina, power, endurance, ring savvy, and a solid chin. in addition, he is an accurate, efficient puncher with effective countering ability. his defensive skills are top notch; he stands upright while holding his arms and gloves high to protect himself, which is similar to winky wright's defensive stance. as a result of his defensive prowess and ability to absorb a punch, he has never lost a bout via knockout.

clindamycin,antibiotic,"clindamycin is an antibiotic used for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections, including bone or joint infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, strep throat, pneumonia, middle ear infections, and endocarditis. it can also be used to treat acne, and some cases of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). in combination with quinine, it can be used for malaria. it is available by mouth, by injection into a vein, and as a cream to be applied to the skin or in the vagina.common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, rash, and pain at the site of injection. it increases the risk of hospital-acquired clostridium difficile colitis about fourfold and thus is only recommended when other antibiotics are not appropriate. alternative antibiotics may be recommended as a result. it appears to be generally safe in pregnancy. it is of the lincosamide class and works by blocking bacteria from making protein.clindamycin was first made in 1966 from lincomycin. it is on the world health organization's list of essential medicines. it is available as a generic medication. in 2017, it was the 137th most commonly prescribed medication in the united states, with more than four million prescriptions.


== medical uses ==
clindamycin is used primarily to treat anaerobic infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria, including dental infections, and infections of the respiratory tract, skin, and soft tissue, and peritonitis. in people with hypersensitivity to penicillins, clindamycin may be used to treat infections caused by susceptible aerobic bacteria, as well. it is also used to treat bone and joint infections, particularly those caused by staphylococcus aureus. topical application of clindamycin phosphate can be used to treat mild to moderate acne.


=== acne ===

for treatment of acne, in the long term the combined use of topical clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide was similar to salicylic acid plus benzoyl peroxide. topical clindamycin plus topical benzoyl peroxide is more effective than topical clindamycin alone.


=== susceptible bacteria ===
it is most effective against infections involving the following types of organisms:

aerobic gram-positive cocci, including some members of the staphylococcus and streptococcus (e.g. pneumococcus) genera, but not enterococci.
anaerobic, gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria, including some bacteroides, fusobacterium, and prevotella, although resistance is increasing in bacteroides fragilis.most aerobic gram-negative bacteria (such as pseudomonas, legionella, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella) are resistant to clindamycin, as are the facultative anaerobic enterobacteriaceae. a notable exception is capnocytophaga canimorsus, for which clindamycin is a first-line drug of choice.the following represents mic susceptibility data for a few medically significant pathogens.
staphylococcus aureus: 0.016 μg/ml - >256 μg/ml
streptococcus pneumoniae: 0.002 μg/ml - >256 μg/ml
streptococcus pyogenes: <0.015 μg/ml - >64 μg/ml


=== d-test ===

when testing a gram-positive culture for sensitivity to clindamycin, it is common to perform a ""d-test"" to determine if there is a macrolide-resistant subpopulation of bacteria present. this test is necessary because some bacteria express a phenotype known as mlsb, in which susceptibility tests will indicate the bacteria are susceptible to clindamycin, but in vitro the pathogen displays inducible resistance.
to perform a d-test, an agar plate is inoculated with the bacteria in question and two drug-impregnated disks (one with erythromycin, one with clindamycin) are placed 15–20 mm apart on the plate. if the area of inhibition around the clindamycin disk is ""d"" shaped, the test result is positive and clindamycin should not be used due to the possibility of resistant pathogens and therapy failure. if the area of inhibition around the clindamycin disk is circular, the test result is negative and clindamycin can be used.


=== malaria ===
given with chloroquine or quinine, clindamycin is effective and well tolerated in treating plasmodium falciparum malaria; the latter combination is particularly useful for children, and is the treatment of choice for pregnant women who become infected in areas where resistance to chloroquine is common. clindamycin should not be used as an antimalarial by itself, although it appears to be very effective as such, because of its slow action. patient-derived isolates of plasmodium falciparum from the peruvian amazon have been reported to be resistant to clindamycin as evidenced by in vitro drug susceptibility testing.


=== other ===
clindamycin may be useful in skin and soft tissue infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). many strains of mrsa are still susceptible to clindamycin; however, in the united states spreading from the west coast eastwards, mrsa is becoming increasingly resistant.while it has been used in intraabdominal infections, such use is generally not recommended due to resistance.clindamycin is used in cases of suspected toxic shock syndrome, often in combination with a bactericidal agent such as vancomycin. the rationale for this approach is a presumed synergy between vancomycin, which causes the death of the bacteria by breakdown of the cell wall, and clindamycin, which is a powerful inhibitor of toxin synthesis. both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown clindamycin reduces the production of exotoxins by staphylococci; it may also induce changes in the surface structure of bacteria that make them more sensitive to immune system attack (opsonization and phagocytosis).clindamycin has been proven to decrease the risk of premature births in women diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis during early pregnancy to about a third of the risk of untreated women.the combination of clindamycin and quinine is the standard treatment for severe babesiosis.clindamycin may also be used to treat toxoplasmosis, and, in combination with primaquine, is effective in treating mild to moderate pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.clindamycin, either applied to skin or taken by mouth, may also be used in hidradenitis suppurativa.


== side effects ==
common adverse drug reactions associated with systemic clindamycin therapy – found in over 1% of people – include: diarrhea, pseudomembranous colitis, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or cramps and/or rash. high doses (both intravenous and oral) may cause a metallic taste. common adverse drug reactions associated with topical formulations – found in over 10% of people – include: dryness, burning, itching, scaliness, or peeling of skin (lotion, solution); erythema (foam, lotion, solution); oiliness (gel, lotion).  additional side effects include contact dermatitis. common side effects – found in over 10% of people – in vaginal applications include fungal infection.rarely –  in less than 0.1% of people –  clindamycin therapy has been associated with anaphylaxis, blood dyscrasias, polyarthritis, jaundice, raised liver enzyme levels, renal dysfunction, cardiac arrest, and/or hepatotoxicity.


=== clostridioides difficile ===
pseudomembranous colitis is a potentially lethal condition commonly associated with clindamycin, but which also occurs with other antibiotics. overgrowth of clostridioides difficile, which is inherently resistant to clindamycin, results in the production of a toxin that causes a range of adverse effects, from diarrhea to colitis and toxic megacolon.


=== pregnancy and breastfeeding ===
use of clindamycin during pregnancy is generally considered safe.clindamycin is classified as compatible with breastfeeding by the american academy of pediatrics, however, the who categorizes it as ""avoid if possible"". it is classified as l2 probably compatible with breastfeeding according to medications and mothers' milk. a 2009 review found it was likely safe in breastfeeding mothers, but did find one complication (hematochezia) in a breastfed infant which might be attributable to clindamycin. lactmed lists potentially negative gastrointestinal effects in babies whose mothers take it while breastfeeding but did not see that as justification to stop breastfeeding.


== interactions ==
clindamycin may prolong the effects of neuromuscular-blocking drugs, such as succinylcholine and vecuronium. its similarity to the mechanism of action of macrolides and chloramphenicol means they should not be given simultaneously, as this causes antagonism and possible cross-resistance.


== chemistry ==

clindamycin is a semisynthetic derivative of lincomycin, a natural antibiotic produced by the actinobacterium streptomyces lincolnensis. it is obtained by 7(s)-chloro-substitution of the 7(r)-hydroxyl group of lincomycin. the synthesis of clindamycin was first announced by bj magerlein, rd birkenmeyer, and f kagan on the fifth interscience conference on antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy (icaac) in 1966. it has been on the market since 1968.clindamycin is white or yellow. it is very soluble in water. the topically used clindamycin phosphate is a phosphate-ester prodrug of clindamycin.


== mechanism of action ==

clindamycin has a primarily bacteriostatic effect. at higher concentrations, it may be bactericidal. it is a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor by inhibiting ribosomal translocation, in a similar way to macrolides. it does so by binding to the 50s rrna of the large bacterial ribosome subunit, overlapping with the binding sites of the oxazolidinone, pleuromutilin, and macrolide antibiotics, among others. the binding is reversible. clindamycin is more effective than lincomycin.the x-ray crystal structures of clindamycin bound to ribosomes (or ribosomal subunits) derived from escherichia coli, deinococcus radiodurans, and haloarcura marismortui have been determined; the structure of the closely related antibiotic lincomycin bound to the 50s ribosomal subunit of staphylococcus aureus has also been reported.


== market ==


=== cost ===
clindamycin is available as a generic medication and is not very expensive.


=== available forms ===
clindamycin preparations that are taken by mouth include capsules (containing clindamycin hydrochloride) and oral suspensions (containing clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride). oral suspension is not favored for administration of clindamycin to children, due to its extremely foul taste and odor. clindamycin is formulated in a vaginal cream and as vaginal ovules for treatment of bacterial vaginosis. it is also available for topical administration in gel form, as a lotion, and in a foam delivery system (each containing clindamycin phosphate) and a solution in ethanol (containing clindamycin hydrochloride) and is used primarily as a prescription acne treatment.several combination acne treatments containing clindamycin are also marketed, such as single-product formulations of clindamycin with benzoyl peroxide—sold as benzaclin (sanofi-aventis), duac (a gel form made by stiefel), and acanya, among other trade names—and, in the united states, a combination of clindamycin and tretinoin, sold as ziana. in india, vaginal suppositories containing clindamycin in combination with clotrimazole are manufactured by olive health care and sold as clinsup-v. in egypt, vaginal cream containing clindamycin produced by biopharmgroup sold as vagiclind indicated for vaginosis.clindamycin is available as a generic drug, for both systemic (oral and intravenous) and topical use. (the exception is the vaginal suppository, which is not available as a generic in the usa).
clindamycin is marketed as generic and under trade names including cleocin hcl, clindacin, dalacin, evoclin and lincocin (bangladesh). other combination products include clindoxyl.


== veterinary use ==
the veterinary uses of clindamycin are quite similar to its human indications, and include treatment of osteomyelitis, skin infections, and toxoplasmosis, for which it is the preferred drug in dogs and cats. they can be used both by mouth and topically. a disadvantage is that bacterial resistance can develop fairly quickly. gastrointestinal upset may also occur. toxoplasmosis rarely causes symptoms in cats, but can do so in very young or immunocompromised kittens and cats.

== history ==


=== line opening ===
a line linking ōmiya with kawagoe and continuing to the hachikō line at komagawa was first proposed in march 1920. construction work started in september 1935, with the line opening on 22 july 1940.


=== switch to diesel ===
services were initially steam hauled, but diesel multiple unit trains were introduced from 1 june 1950. the final steam-hauled passenger train ran on 30 september 1969.


=== electrification ===
the line was electrified (1,500 v dc) from 30 september 1985, and through running commenced to and from the saikyō line, which opened at the same time. the tracks were doubled between ōmiya to nisshin, and a new emu depot was opened close to minami-furuya station. a special ""kawagoe line diesel sayonara"" train ran on the line on 3 november 1985.


=== hachikō line through services ===
through services between kawagoe and hachiōji on the hachikō line began on 16 march 1996 following the electrification of the southern section of the hachikō line between komagawa and hachiōji.

inner cell mass cell,cell,"in early embryogenesis of most eutherian mammals, the inner cell mass (icm; also known as the embryoblast or pluriblast) is the mass of cells inside the primordial embryo that will eventually give rise to the definitive structures of the fetus. this structure forms in the earliest steps of development, before implantation into the endometrium of the uterus has occurred. the icm lies within the blastocoele (more correctly termed ""blastocyst cavity"", as it is not strictly homologous to the blastocoele of anamniote vertebrates) and is entirely surrounded by the single layer of cells called trophoblast.


== further development ==
the physical and functional separation of the inner cell mass from the trophectoderm (te) is a special feature of mammalian development and is the first cell lineage specification in these embryos.  following fertilization in the oviduct, the mammalian embryo undergoes a relatively slow round of cleavages to produce an eight-cell morula.  each cell of the morula, called a blastomere, increases surface contact with its neighbors in a process called compaction.  this results in a polarization of the cells within the morula, and further cleavage yields a blastocyst of roughly 32 cells.  in mice, about 12 internal cells comprise the new inner cell mass and 20 – 24 cells comprise the surrounding trophectoderm. there is variation between species of mammals as to the number of cells at compaction with bovine embryos showing differences related to compaction as early as 9-15 cells and in rabbits not until after 32 cells. there is also interspecies variation in gene expression patterns in early embryos.the icm and the te will generate distinctly different cell types as implantation starts and embryogenesis continues.  trophectoderm cells form extraembryonic tissues, which act in a supporting role for the embryo proper. furthermore, these cells pump fluid into the interior of the blastocyst, causing the formation of a polarized blastocyst with the icm attached to the trophectoderm at one end (see figure). this difference in cellular localization causes the icm cells exposed to the fluid cavity to adopt a primitive endoderm (or hypoblast) fate, while the remaining cells adopt a primitive ectoderm (or epiblast) fate. the hypoblast contributes to extraembryonic membranes and the epiblast will give rise to the ultimate embryo proper as well as some extraembryonic tissues.


== regulation of cellular specification ==
since segregation of pluripotent cells of the inner cell mass from the remainder of the blastocyst is integral to mammalian development, considerable research has been performed to elucidate the corresponding cellular and molecular mechanisms of this process. there is primary interest in which transcription factors and signaling molecules direct blastomere asymmetric divisions leading to what are known as inside and outside cells and thus cell lineage specification. however, due to the variability and regulative nature of mammalian embryos, experimental evidence for establishing these early fates remains incomplete.
at the transcription level, the transcription factors oct4, nanog, cdx2, and tead4 have all been implicated in establishing and reinforcing the specification of the icm and the te in early mouse embryos. 
oct4: oct4 is expressed in the icm and participate in maintaining its pluripotency, a role that has been recapitulated in icm derived mouse embryonic stem cells. oct4 genetic knockout cells both in vivo and in culture display te morphological characteristics. it has been shown that one transcriptional target of oct4 is the fgf4 gene. this gene normally encodes a ligand secreted by the icm, which induces proliferation in the adjacent polar te.
nanog:  nanog is also expressed in the icm and participates in maintaining its pluripotency. in contrast with oct4, studies of nanog-null mice do not show the reversion of the icm to a te-like morphology, but demonstrate that loss of nanog prevents the icm from generating primitive endoderm.
cdx2: cdx2 is strongly expressed in the te and is required for maintaining its specification. knockout mice for the cdx2 gene undergo compaction, but lose the te epithelial integrity during the late blastocyst stage. furthermore, oct4 expression is subsequently raised in these te cells, indicating cdx2 plays a role in suppressing oct4 in this cell lineage.  moreover, embryonic stem cells can be generated from cdx2-null mice, demonstrating that cdx2 is not essential for icm specification.
tead4: like cdx2, tead4 is required for te function, although the transcription factor is expressed ubiquitously.  tead4-null mice similarly undergo compaction, but fail to generate the blastocoel cavity. like cdx2-null embryos, the tead4-null embryos can yield embryonic stem cells, indicating that tead4 is dispensable for icm specification. recent work has shown that tead4 may help to upregulate cdx2 in the te and its transcriptional activity depends on the coactivator yap. yap’s nuclear localization in outside cells allows it to contribute to te specificity, whereas inside cells sequester yap in the cytoplasm through a phosphorylation event.together these transcription factors function in a positive feedback loop that strengthens the icm to te cellular allocation. initial polarization of blastomeres occurs at the 8-16 cell stage.  an apical-basolateral polarity is visible through the visualization of apical markers such as par3, par6, and apkc as well as the basal marker e-cadherin. the establishment of such a polarity during compaction is thought to generate an environmental identity for inside and outside cells of the embryo.  consequently, stochastic expression of the above transcription factors is amplified into a feedback loop that specifies outside cells to a te fate and inside cells to an icm fate. in the model, an apical environment turns on cdx2, which upregulates its own expression through a downstream transcription factor, elf5. in concert with a third transcription factor, eomes, these genes act to suppress pluripotency genes like oct4 and nanog in the outside cells. thus, te becomes specified and differentiates.  inside cells, however, do not turn on the cdx2 gene, and express high levels of oct4, nanog, and sox2. these genes suppress cdx2 and the inside cells maintain pluripotency generate the icm and eventually the rest of the embryo proper. 
although this dichotomy of genetic interactions is clearly required to divide the blastomeres of the mouse embryo into both the icm and te identities, the initiation of these feedback loops remains under debate. whether they are established stochastically or through an even earlier asymmetry is unclear, and current research seeks to identify earlier markers of asymmetry. for example, some research correlates the first two cleavages during embryogenesis with respect to the prospective animal and vegetal poles with ultimate specification. the asymmetric division of epigenetic information during these first two cleavages, and the orientation and order in which they occur, may contribute to a cell’s position either inside or outside the morula.


== stem cells ==
blastomeres isolated from the icm of mammalian embryos and grown in culture are known as embryonic stem (es) cells. these pluripotent cells, when grown in a carefully coordinated media, can give rise to all three germ layers (ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm) of the adult body. for example, the transcription factor lif4 is required for mouse es cells to be maintained in vitro. blastomeres are dissociated from an isolated icm in an early blastocyst, and their transcriptional code governed by oct4, sox2, and nanog helps maintain an undifferentiated state.
one benefit to the regulative nature in which mammalian embryos develop is the manipulation of blastomeres of the icm to generate knockout mice.  in mouse, mutations in a gene of interest can be introduced retrovirally into cultured es cells, and these can be reintroduced into the icm of an intact embryo.  the result is a chimeric mouse, which develops with a portion of its cells containing the es cell genome. the aim of such a procedure is to incorporate the mutated gene into the germ line of the mouse such that its progeny will be missing one or both alleles of the gene of interest. geneticists widely take advantage of this icm manipulation technique in studying the function of genes in the mammalian system.

telavancin,antibiotic,"telavancin (trade name vibativ) is a bactericidal lipoglycopeptide for use in mrsa or other gram-positive infections. telavancin is a semi-synthetic derivative of vancomycin.the fda approved the drug in september 2009 for complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssi), and in june 2013 for hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia caused by staphylococcus aureus.


== history ==
on 19 october 2007, the us food and drug administration (fda) issued an approvable letter for telavancin. its developer, theravance, submitted a complete response to the letter, and the fda has assigned a prescription drug user fee act (pdufa) target date of 21 july 2008.on 19 november 2008, an fda antiinfective drug advisory committee concluded that they would recommend telavancin be approved by the fda.
the fda approved the drug on 11 september 2009 for complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssi).theravance has also submitted telavancin to the fda in a second indication, nosocomial pneumonia, sometimes referred to as hospital-acquired pneumonia, or hap. on 30 november 2012, an fda advisory panel endorsed approval of a once-daily formulation of telavancin for nosocomial pneumonia when other alternatives are not suitable. however, telavancin did not win the advisory committee's recommendation as first-line therapy for this indication. the committee indicated that the trial data did not prove ""substantial evidence"" of telavancin's safety and efficacy in hospital-acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by gram-positive organisms staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. on 21 june 2013 fda gave approval for telavancin to treat patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia, but indicated it should be used only when alternative treatments are not suitable. fda staff had indicated telavancin has a ""substantially higher risk for death"" for patients with kidney problems or diabetes compared to vancomycin.on march 11 2013, clinigen group plc and theravance, inc. announced that they have entered into an exclusive commercialization agreement in the european union (eu) and certain other countries located in europe for vibativ® (telavancin) for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia (hospital-acquired), including ventilator-associated pneumonia, known or suspected to be caused by methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) when other alternatives are not suitable.


== mechanism of action ==
like vancomycin, telavancin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to the d-ala-d-ala terminus of the peptidoglycan in the growing cell wall (see pharmacology and chemistry of vancomycin). in addition, it disrupts bacterial membranes by depolarization.


== adverse effects ==
common but harmless adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, constipation, and headache.telavancin has a higher rate of kidney failure than vancomycin in two clinical trials. it showed teratogenic effects in animal studies.


== interactions ==
telavancin inhibits the liver enzymes cyp3a4 and cyp3a5. no data regarding the clinical relevance are available.

although the pre-synaptic functions of α2a receptors are often a major focus, the majority of α2 receptors in the brain are actually localized post-synaptically to noradrenergic terminals, and therefore aid in the function of norepinephrine. many post-synaptic α2a receptors have important effects on brain function; for example, α2a receptors are localized on prefrontal cortical neurons where they regulate higher cognitive function.

cephalopod eye,non_science,"cephalopods, as active marine predators, possess sensory organs specialized for use in aquatic conditions.  they have a camera-type eye which consists of an iris, a circular lens, vitreous cavity (eye gel), pigment cells, and photoreceptor cells that translate light from the light-sensitive retina into nerve signals which travel along the optic nerve to the brain. for the past 140 years, the camera-type cephalopod eye has been compared with the vertebrate eye as an example of convergent evolution, where both types of organisms have independently evolved the camera-eye trait and both share similar functionality. contention exists on whether this is truly convergent evolution or parallel evolution. unlike the vertebrate camera eye, the cephalopods' form as invaginations of the body surface (rather than outgrowths of the brain), and consequently the cornea lies over the top of the eye as opposed being a structural part of the eye.  unlike the vertebrate eye, a cephalopod eye is focused through movement, much like the lens of a camera or telescope, rather than changing shape as the lens in the human eye does. the eye is approximately spherical, as is the lens, which is fully internal.cephalopods' eyes develop in such a way that they have retinal axons that pass over the back of the retina, so the optic nerve does not have to pass through the photoreceptor layer to exit the eye and do not have the natural, central, physiological blind spot of vertebrates.the crystalins used in the lens appear to have developed independently from vertebrate crystalins, suggesting a homoplasious origin of the lens.most cephalopods possess complex extraocular muscle systems that allow for very fine control over the gross positioning of the eyes.  octopuses possess an autonomic response that maintains the orientation of their pupils such that they are always horizontal.


== polarized light ==
it has been documented that several types of cephalopods, most notably squid and octopuses, and potentially cuttlefish, have eyes that can distinguish the orientation of polarized light. this sensitivity is due to the orthogonal organization of neighboring photoreceptors. (cephalopods have receptor cells called rhabdoms similar to those of other molluscs.) to illustrate, the vertebrate eye is normally insensitive to polarization differences because visual pigment in rods and cones is arrayed semi-randomly, and is thereby equally sensitive to any orientation of the e-vector axis of the light.  because of their orthogonal organization, the visual pigment molecules in cephalopod eyes have the highest light absorption when aligned properly with the light e-vector axis, allowing sensitivity to differences in polarization.  the precise function of this ability has not been proven, but is hypothesized to be for prey detection, navigation, and possibly communication among the color-changing cephalopods.

		
		
		
		


== evolutionary debate ==
disagreement on whether the evolution of the camera eye within cephalopods and within vertebrates is a parallel evolution or a convergent evolution still exists, although is mostly resolved. the current standing is that of a convergent evolution for their analogous camera-type eye.


=== parallel evolution ===
those maintaining that it is a parallel evolution state that there is evidence that there was a common ancestor containing the genetic information for this eye development. this is evidenced by all bilaterian organisms containing the gene pax6 which expresses for eye development.


=== convergent evolution ===
those supporting a convergent evolution state that this common ancestor would have preceded both cephalopods and vertebrates by a significant margin. the common ancestor with the expression for camera-type eye would have existed approximately 270 million years before the evolution of camera-type eye in cephalopods and approximately 110 to 260 million years before the evolution of camera-type eye in vertebrates. another source of evidence for this is the differences of expression due to independent variants of pax6 arising in both cephalopods and vertebrates. cephalopods contain five variants of pax6 in their genomes which independently arose and are not shared by vertebrates, although they allow for a similar gene expression when compared to the pax6 of vertebrates.


== research and medical use ==
the main medical use emerging in this field is for research on eye development and ocular diseases. new research studies on ocular gene expression are being performed using cephalopod eyes due to the evidence of their convergent evolution with the analogous human eye. these studies replace the previous drosophila studies for gene expression during eye development as the most accurate, although drosophila studies remain the most common. the conclusion that they are analogous lends credibility to their comparison for medical use in the first place, since the trait in both would have been shaped through natural selection by similar pressures in similar environments; meaning there would be similar expression of ocular disease in both organisms’ eyes.an advantage of cephalopod eye experimentation is that cephalopods can regenerate their eyes due to their ability to re-enable their developmental processes, which allows studies of the same cephalopod to continue past one trial sample when studying the effects of disease. this also permits for a more complex study concerning how regeneration may be conserved in cephalopod genomes and if it may be somewhat conserved in the human genome alongside the genes expressing for the camera eye.

eosin b(2-),reagent,"eosin is the name of several fluorescent acidic compounds which bind to and form salts with basic, or eosinophilic, compounds like proteins containing amino acid residues such as arginine and lysine, and stains them dark red or pink as a result of the actions of bromine on fluorescein. in addition to staining proteins in the cytoplasm, it can be used to stain collagen and muscle fibers for examination under the microscope. structures that stain readily with eosin are termed eosinophilic. in the field of histology, eosin y is the form of eosin used most often as a histologic stain.


== etymology ==
eosin was named by its inventor heinrich caro after the nickname (eos) of a childhood friend, anna peters.


== variants ==
there are actually two very closely related compounds commonly referred to as eosin. most often used is in histology is eosin y (also known as eosin y ws, eosin yellowish, acid red 87, c.i. 45380, bromoeosine, bromofluoresceic acid, d&c red no. 22); it has a very slightly yellowish cast. the other eosin compound is eosin b (eosin bluish, acid red 91, c.i. 45400, saffrosine, eosin scarlet, or imperial red); it has a very faint bluish cast. the two dyes are interchangeable, and the use of one or the other is a matter of preference and tradition.
eosin y is a tetrabromo derivative of fluorescein. eosin b is a dibromo dinitro derivative of fluorescein.


== uses ==


=== use in histology ===

eosin is most often used as a counterstain to hematoxylin in h&e (haematoxylin and eosin) staining.  h&e staining is one of the most commonly used techniques in histology. tissue stained with haematoxylin and eosin shows cytoplasm stained pink-orange and nuclei stained darkly, either blue or purple. eosin also stains red blood cells intensely red.
for staining, eosin y is typically used in concentrations of 1 to 5 percent weight by volume, dissolved in water or ethanol. for prevention of mold growth in aqueous solutions, thymol is sometimes added. a small concentration (0.5 percent) of acetic acid usually gives a deeper red stain to the tissue.
it is listed as an iarc class 3 carcinogen.


=== other uses ===

eosin is also used as a red dye in inks; however, the molecule, especially that of eosin y, tends to degrade over time, leaving behind its bromine atoms, hence causing paint incorporating such a dye to obtain a darker brown tinge over time. a notable user of eosin dye was the post-impressionist painter, van gogh.

ministry (government department),non_science,"a ministry is a high  governmental organisation, headed by a minister, that is meant to manage a specific sector of public administration. governments may have differing numbers and types of ministries, but the brockhaus and efron encyclopedic dictionary notes that all states have (often under varying names) a ministry of interior, a ministry of foreign affairs, a ministry of defence (which may be divided into ministries for land, naval, and air forces), a ministry of justice, and a ministry of finance. a ministry of education or similar is also commonly present.ministries are usually immediate subdivisions of the cabinet (the executive branch of the government), and subordinate to its chief executive who is called prime minister, chief minister, president, minister-president, or (federal) chancellor.
during the 20th century, many countries increasingly tended to replace the term  ""ministry"" with titles such as ""department"", ""office"", or ""state secretariat"". in some countries, these terms may be used with specific meanings: for example, an office may be a subdivision of a department or ministry.


== examples ==


=== canada ===
in canada, five of the ten provincial governments use the term ""ministry"" to describe their departments (ontario, quebec, saskatchewan, british columbia, and alberta) but the other five, as well as the three territorial governments and the federal government, use the term ""department"". despite the difference in nomenclature, both the provincial and federal governments use the term ""minister"" to describe the head of a ministry or department.  the specific task assigned to a minister is referred to as his or her ""portfolio"".


=== united kingdom ===

in the united kingdom, all government organisations that consist of civil servants, and which may or may not be headed by a government minister or secretary of state, are considered to be departments. until 2018, the term ""ministry"" had been retained only for the ministry of defence and the ministry of justice. on 8 january 2018, prime minister theresa may announced that the department of communities and local government would be renamed at the ministry of housing, communities and local government to emphasise her government's prioritising of housing policy.


=== other countries ===
some countries, such as switzerland, the philippines and the united states, do not use or no longer use the term ""ministry""  and instead call their main government bodies ""departments"". however, in other countries such as luxembourg a department is a subdivision of a ministry, usually led by a government member called a secretary of state who is subordinate to the minister. 
in australia at the federal level, and also at the state level, the term ""ministry"" refers to the ministerial office held by a member of government, the executive, which is then responsible for one or more departments, the top division of the public service. the collection of departments responsible to a ministerial office and hence the minister, is referred to as the minister's ""portfolio"".
new zealand's state agencies include many ministries and a smaller number of departments. increasingly, state agencies are styled neither as ministries nor as departments. all new zealand agencies are under the direction of one or more ministers or associate ministers, whether they are styled ""ministries"" or not. each body also has an apolitical chief executive, and in ministries and departments these chief executives often have the title of secretary.
in hong kong, the term ""bureau"" is used, and departments are subordinate to the bureaus. in mexico, ministries are referred to as secretariats. in 1999, the ministries of the federal government of belgium became known as ""federal public services"", the exception being the ministry of defense which kept the original designation.
in republic of china, ministry is used.
in people's republic of china, ministry is used.
the organization of the portuguese government implemented in 2015, ceased to expressly foresee the existence of ministries, with the portfolios of the ministers being referred as ""governative areas"". while some governative areas continue to be structured as traditional  ministries (finance, defense, foreign affairs, etc.), other governative areas received a more flexible organization.
in nigeria each ministry is led by a minister who is not a member of the nigerian legislature (due to the separation of powers) and is responsible to the popularly elected president.
in lebanon, there are 21 ministries. each ministry is led by a minister, and the prime minister is the 22nd minister of the lebanese government.
in the european union, departments are termed directorate(s)-general with the civil servant in charge called a director-general (in the european commission, the political head of the department is one of the european commissioners). 
the government departments of the soviet union were named ""people's commissariats"" between 1917 and 1946.


== in popular culture ==
the term ""ministry"" has also been widely used in fiction, notably in satires and parodies.


=== books and films ===
the ministry of magic is the governing body of the wizarding world of the united kingdom and ireland in the harry potter series (not a department of the british government responsible for magical affairs). it is led by a minister for magic.
in the nineteen eighty-four novel there are four ministries in charge of airstrip one (formerly the united kingdom), : the ministry of truth (education, culture and propaganda), the ministry of love (the interior), the ministry of plenty (economic affairs) and the ministry of peace (war and foreign affairs) .
the ministry of information retrieval features in the film brazil.
the ministry of social coherence appears in an estonian comedy riigimehed (statesmen).

serine/threonine-protein kinase receptor r3 sequence variant a482v (human),protein,"glutamate-rich protein 4 is encoded by the gene erich4 and can be otherwise known as chromosome 19 open reading frame 69 (c19orf69). erich4 is highly conserved in mammals and exhibits overexpression in tissues of the kidneys, terminal ileum, and duodenum. the function of erich4 has yet to be well understood by the scientific community but is suggested to contribute to immune inflammatory responses.


== gene ==
erich4 is located on the sense strand of 19q13.2 in humans, consists of 2,340 base pairs, and contains 2 exons. erich4, on the sense strand, is located within dmac2 and next pcat19 and b3nt8 which are all on the antisense strand.


=== promoter & predicted transcription factors (tf) ===
the promoter is predicted to begin 1,806 bp upstream from the 5' utr and consists of 1,819 bp which overlaps with the coding sequence by 13 bp.


== mrna ==

the erich4 mrna sequence is 955 nucleotides in length with a fold energy predicted as -139.80 kcal/mol with -0.258 energy/base.


=== alternative splicing ===
erich4 has one different protein-encoding transcript variant, or isoform.


== protein ==


=== general properties ===
the primary encoded protein consists of 130 amino acids and has a predicted molecular mass of 14.5 kda and isoelectric point of 4 pi. as suggested by the protein's name, glutamate-rich protein 4, the protein is most highly composed of glutamic acid amino acids at 17.7% of the protein's composition followed by leucine at 14.6%, and then proline at 9.2%. erich4 has no positive or negative charge clusters. the human protein has one identifiable mixed cluster from amino acid 91 to 116 with 3 positively-charged, 15 negatively-charged, and 8 neutral amino acids. the same mixed cluster region in humans is frequently negative within erich4's orthologous proteins. this protein contains no significant hydrophobic or transmembrane segments which are supported with comparison to five of erich4's orthologs (graymouse lemur, sheep, house mouse, african elephant, and opossum).


=== domains ===
erich4 has one identified domain of unknown function, duf4530, which is found in eukaryotes. proteins in this family are typically 140 amino acids in length and erich4 is a known human member of this family.


=== secondary structure ===
a cross-program analysis determines erich4 protein to be composed of five separated alpha helixes and five interspersing coils. the alpha helix segments span from amino acids 2-9, 21-24, 47-58, 61-94, and 104-111 in the protein sequence. erich4 is not predicted to contain beta-sheets.


=== tertiary structure ===
program analysis in swiss-model proposes a tertiary structure for erich4 by matching the protein against the template of nlrp6 with a sequence identity of 25.79%, sequence similarity of 0.30, and coverage of 0.43 for amino acids 43-92 in erich4.


=== post-translational regulation ===
erich4 has proposed phosphorylation at serine amino acids 28 and 96 and amino acid 36, a threonine, by casein kinase ii and protein kinase c, respectively. erich4 is not predicted to be undergo a methionine cleavage or acetylation.


=== localization ===
this protein is predicted to be intracellular without any transmembrane regions. sub-cellular localization is predicted to be mostly localized to the cytoplasm with a reliability score of 70.6 via the reinhardt's method. no significant o-glcnac site and n-myristoylation predictions.


== tissue expression ==
erich4’s highest levels of expression are within human tissue of the duodenum and small intestine, followed by the kidneys. notably, expression within the small intestines is highest in the twentieth week of human fetal development. within a representative set of mouse (mus musculus) tissues, erich4 is most highly expressed within the kidneys, followed by and in decreasing expression, the large intestines, adult duodenum, and adult small intestine. the sigma-aldrich antibody product, hpa042632, derived from rabbit, has a strong granular cytoplasmic positivity in cytoplasmic structure in glandular cells (goblet cells) of the rectum.


=== abnormal tissue expression ===
erich4 has high expression within normal tissue and low-to-medium expression with renal cell carcinoma tissue.an analysis examining erich4 was reviewed in tissues of the ileum and colon that were either normal or afflicted with crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. erich4 had high (~90%) expression within the ileum for all states (normal/control, crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis). erich4 also has a higher expression in crohn's disease than in either normal tissue or ulcerative colitis.


== function ==
the function of erich4 has yet to be well understood by the scientific community and therefore, requires further research.


=== interactions ===
according to string analysis, erich4 has multiple predicted interactions with other proteins including proteins with associated immune function and expression within the gastrointestinal tract or testes from textmining. no experimentally confirmed protein interactions yet.


== homology ==


=== paralogs ===
no human paralogs were found for the gene.


=== orthologs ===
orthologs have been identified in most mammals for which complete genome data is available. notably, erich4 orthologs are only present in placental and marsupial mammals but absent in monotremes. the most distant ortholog was identified in the gray short-tailed opossum which is a marsupial mammal.no significant similarities were found in the vertebrates aves, reptilia, amphibia, chondrichthyes, osteichthyes or agnatha. searching to exclude vertebrates in blast and blat produced no significant ortholog findings for invertebrates, fungi, and bacteria.


=== molecular evolution ===
the m value, or number of corrected amino acid changes per 100 residues, for the gene erich4 was plotted against the divergence of species in millions of years. when compared to the data of hemoglobin, fibrinogen alpha chain, and cytochrome c, it was determined that the gene has the closest progression to fibrinogen alpha chain, suggesting a relatively rapid pace of evolution. m values for erich4 were derived from percentage of identity of species protein sequences compared to the human sequence using the formula derived from the molecular clock hypothesis.

tumor protein 63 isoform r3 (rat),protein,"glial fibrillary acidic protein (gfap) is a protein that is encoded by the gfap gene in humans. it is a type iii intermediate filament (if) protein that is expressed by numerous cell types of the central nervous system (cns), including astrocytes and ependymal cells during development. gfap has also been found to be expressed in glomeruli and peritubular fibroblasts taken from rat kidneys, leydig cells of the testis in both hamsters and humans, human keratinocytes, human osteocytes and chondrocytes and stellate cells of the pancreas and liver in rats.gfap is closely related to the other three non-epithelial type iii if family members, vimentin, desmin and peripherin, which are all involved in the structure and function of the cell’s cytoskeleton. gfap is thought to help to maintain astrocyte mechanical strength as well as the shape of cells, but its exact function remains poorly understood, despite the number of studies using it as a cell marker. the protein was named and first isolated and characterized by lawrence f. eng in 1969. in humans, it is located on the long arm of chromosome 17.


== structure ==
type iii intermediate filaments contain three domains, named the head, rod and tail domains. the specific dna sequence for the rod domain may differ between different type iii intermediate filaments, but the structure of the protein is highly conserved. this rod domain coils around that of another filament to form a dimer, with the n-terminal and c-terminal of each filament aligned. type iii filaments such as gfap are capable of forming both homodimers and heterodimers; gfap can polymerize with other type iii proteins. gfap and other type iii if proteins cannot assemble with keratins, the type i and ii intermediate filaments: in cells that express both proteins, two separate intermediate filament networks form, which can allow for specialization and increased variability.
to form networks, the initial gfap dimers combine to make staggered tetramers, which are the basic subunits of an intermediate filament. since rod domains alone in vitro do not form filaments, the non-helical head and tail domains are necessary for filament formation. the head and tail regions have greater variability of sequence and structure. in spite of this increased variability, the head of gfap contains two conserved arginines and an aromatic residue that have been shown to be required for proper assembly.


== function in the central nervous system ==
gfap is expressed in the central nervous system in astrocyte cells. it is involved in many important cns processes, including cell communication and the functioning of the blood brain barrier.
gfap has been shown to play a role in mitosis by adjusting the filament network present in the cell. during mitosis, there is an increase in the amount of phosphorylated gfap, and a movement of this modified protein to the cleavage furrow. there are different sets of kinases at work; cdc2 kinase acts only at the g2 phase transition, while other gfap kinases are active at the cleavage furrow alone. this specificity of location allows for precise regulation of gfap distribution to the daughter cells. studies have also shown that gfap knockout mice undergo multiple degenerative processes including abnormal myelination, white matter structure deterioration, and functional/structural impairment of the blood–brain barrier. these data suggest that gfap is necessary for many critical roles in the cns.
gfap is proposed to play a role in astrocyte-neuron interactions as well as cell-cell communication. in vitro, using antisense rna, astrocytes lacking gfap do not form the extensions usually present with neurons. studies have also shown that purkinje cells in gfap knockout mice do not exhibit normal structure, and these mice demonstrate deficits in conditioning experiments such as the eye-blink task. biochemical studies of gfap have shown mgcl2 and/or calcium/calmodulin dependent phosphorylation at various serine or threonine residues by pkc and pka which are two kinases that are important for the cytoplasmic transduction of signals. these data highlight the importance of gfap for cell-cell communication.
gfap has also been shown to be important in repair after cns injury. more specifically for its role in the formation of glial scars in a multitude of locations throughout the cns including the eye and brain.


=== autoimmune gfap astrocytopathy ===
in 2016 a cns inflammatory disorder associated with anti-gfap antibodies was described. patients with autoimmune gfap astrocytopathy developed meningoencephalomyelitis with inflammation of the meninges, the brain parenchyma, and the spinal cord. about one third of cases were associated with various cancers and many also expressed other cns autoantibodies.
meningoencephalitis is the predominant clinical presentation of autoimmune gfap astrocytopathy in published case series. it also can appear associated with encephalomyelitis and parkinsonism.


== disease states ==

there are multiple disorders associated with improper gfap regulation, and injury can cause glial cells to react in detrimental ways. glial scarring is a consequence of several neurodegenerative conditions, as well as injury that severs neural material. the scar is formed by astrocytes interacting with fibrous tissue to re-establish the glial margins around the central injury core and is partially caused by up-regulation of gfap.another condition directly related to gfap is alexander disease, a rare genetic disorder. its symptoms include mental and physical retardation, dementia, enlargement of the brain and head, spasticity (stiffness of arms and/or legs), and seizures. the cellular mechanism of the disease is the presence of cytoplasmic accumulations containing gfap and heat shock proteins, known as rosenthal fibers. mutations in the coding region of gfap have been shown to contribute to the accumulation of rosenthal fibers. some of these mutations have been proposed to be detrimental to cytoskeleton formation as well as an increase in caspase 3 activity, which would lead to increased apoptosis of cells with these mutations. gfap therefore plays an important role in the pathogenesis of alexander disease.
notably, the expression of some gfap isoforms have been reported to decrease in response to acute infection or neurodegeneration.
additionally, reduction in gfap expression has also been reported in wernicke's encephalopathy. the hiv-1 viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 can directly inhibit the phosphorylation of gfap and gfap levels can be decreased in response to chronic infection with hiv-1, varicella zoster, and pseudorabies. decreases in gfap expression have been reported in down's syndrome, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression.in a study of 22 child patients undergoing extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo), children with abnormally high levels of gfap were 13 times more likely to die and 11 times more likely to suffer brain injury than children with normal gfap levels. gfap levels are already used as a marker of neurologic damage in adults who suffer strokes and traumatic brain injuries.


== interactions ==
glial fibrillary acidic protein has been shown to interact with men1 and psen1.


== isoforms ==
although gfap alpha is the only isoform which is able to assemble homomerically, gfap has 8 different isoforms which label distinct subpopulations of astrocytes in the human and rodent brain. these isoforms include gfap kappa, gfap +1 and the currently best researched gfap delta. gfap delta appears to be linked with neural stem cells (nscs) and may be involved in migration. gfap+1 is an antibody which labels two isoforms. although gfap+1 positive astrocytes are supposedly not reactive astrocytes, they have a wide variety of morphologies including processes of up to 0.95mm (seen in the human brain). the expression of gfap+1 positive astrocytes is linked with old age and the onset of ad pathology.

jay schulberg,non_science,"jay william schulberg (july 17, 1939 – january 12, 2005) was an american advertising executive who had chief creative positions at both ogilvy & mather and bozell worldwide, with an approach to developing concise ads with memorable taglines. he was responsible for creating many notable advertising campaigns including the got milk? milk mustache campaign, the ""excedrin headache"" that could only be cured by the ""extra-strength pain reliever"", and the american express"" don't leave home without it"" campaign with karl malden as spokesman.


== biography ==
born in manhattan schulberg attended new york university from which he graduated in 1961. he had originally planned to pursue a career as a screenwriter, following in the path of his cousin budd schulberg who had written the academy award-winning screenplay for on the waterfront.


=== advertising ===
he was hired by ogilvy & mather in 1961 as a junior copywriter. in the 1970s, he used karl malden then starring in the police drama the streets of san francisco, to deliver the line ""don't leave home without it"" to emphasize the safety of american express traveler's checks. ""a dry baby is a happy baby"" was a line developed for huggies diapers, used in ads with happy infants. other campaigns pitched the ""extra-strength pain reliever"" as the cure for an ""excedrin headache"" and used an older actor to introduce consumers to the ""good old-fashioned lemonade"" flavor of country time lemonade. other clients at ogilvy & mather included at&t, duracell, hershey's, maxwell house, and sports illustrated.he was hired by bozell in november 1987 as executive vice president, creative director. he developed a campaign for the national milk processors board in 1994 featuring celebrities drinking milk, as part of an effort to increase milk consumption. the campaign, created by art director bernie hogya and copywriter jennifer gold, featured celebrity photographs by annie leibovitz of notables such as lauren bacall and naomi campbell with a milk mustache and the tagline ""milk. what a surprise!"" the program next included men as well as women with milk above their lip, and the slogan ""where's your mustache?"" and later, ""got milk?"". schulberg recounted his experiences in the 1998 new york times best-seller the milk mustache book, co-written with bernie hogya and sal taibi.after retiring in 1999, he worked as creative director of a $10 million public service campaign initiated in 2001 that promoted values such as determination, perseverance and selflessness, featuring everyday people as ""the heroes all around us, whose stories are rarely told"".

the president of the czech republic has the authority to act independently in a number of substantive areas. one of the office's strongest powers is that of veto, which returns a bill to parliament. although the veto may be overridden by parliament with an absolute majority vote (over 50%) of all deputies, the ability to refuse to sign legislation acts as a check on the power of the legislature. the only kind of bills a president can neither veto nor approve are acts that would change the constitution.the president also has the leading role in the appointment of persons to key high offices, including appointment of judges to the supreme and constitutional courts (with the permission of the senate), and members of the bank board of the czech national bank.


=== limited sole authority ===
there are some powers reserved to the president, but can be exercised only under limited circumstances. chief among these is the dissolution of the chamber of deputies. while the president can dissolve the chamber on his own authority, forcing a new election of that body within 60 days, this can be done only under conditions prescribed by the constitution.


=== duties shared ===
many of the president's powers can only be exercised with the assent of the government, as expressed by the signature of the prime minister. these include all matters having to do with foreign relations and the use of the military, the appointment of judges to lower courts, and the granting of amnesty. except when the chamber of deputies has been dissolved because of its failure to form or maintain a government, the president may call for elections to the chamber and the senate only with the prime minister's approval.the president also shares responsibility with the chamber of deputies for appointing the president and vice president of the supreme control office – the body in charge of implementing the national budget – although this appointment does not technically require the signature of the prime minister.


=== immunity from prosecution ===
under art. 54 (3) and 65 (3) of the constitution, the president may not be held liable for any alleged criminal acts while executing the duties of office. such prosecution may not occur either while the president is in office or at any time thereafter. furthermore, art 65 (1) prevents trial or detention for prosecution of a criminal offense or tort while in office. the only sort of prosecution allowed for a sitting president is that of high treason, which can only be carried out by the senate, and can only result in removal from office and a ban on regaining the office at a later date.


=== ceremonial powers ===
many of the duties of the czech president can be said to be ceremonial to one degree or another, especially since the president has relatively few powers independent of the will of the prime minister. a good example of this is the status as commander in chief of the military. no part of these duties can take place but through the assent of the prime minister. in matters of war, he is in every sense merely a figurehead, since the constitution gives all substantive constitutional authority over the use of the armed forces to the parliament. in fact, the only specific thing the constitution allows the president to do with respect to the military is to appoint its generals – but even this must be done with the signature of the prime minister.many of the president's ceremonial duties fall under provisions of the constitution that allow the exercise of powers ""not explicitly defined"" in the constitution, but allowed by a lesser law. in other words, parliament has the power to allow the president whatever responsibilities they deem proper, without necessarily having to amend the constitution. such a law was passed in 1994 with respect to the awarding of state decorations. while the constitution explicitly allows the conferring of honors and awarding of medals by the president only with the signature of the prime minister, parliament acted in 1994 to grant the president power to do so on his own authority. hence, this particular duty is effectively shared between the parliament and the president. the act even allows the president to choose someone to perform the actual presentation ceremony.


== election ==
until 1956, the office of president was filled following an indirect election by the parliament of the czech republic. in february 2012, a change to a direct election was passed by the senate, and after the related implementation law also was passed by both chambers of the parliament, it was enacted by presidential assent on 1 august 2012; meaning that it legally entered into force on 1 october 2012.


=== electoral procedure ===
the term of office of the president is 5 years. a newly elected president will begin the five-year term on the day of taking the official oath. candidates standing for office must be 40 years of age, and must not have already been elected twice consecutively. since the only term limit is that no person can be elected more than twice consecutively, a person may theoretically achieve the presidency more than twice. prospective candidates must either submit petitions with the signatures of 50,000 citizens, or be nominated by 20 deputies or 10 senators.
the constitution does not prescribe a specific date for presidential elections, but stipulates that elections shall occur in the window between 30 and 60 days before the end of the sitting president's term, provided that it was called at least 90 days prior to the selected election day. in the event of a president's death, resignation or removal, the election can be held at the earliest 10 days after being called and at the latest 80 days after vacancy of the presidential seat. if no candidate receives a majority, a runoff is held between the top two candidates.
the constitution makes specific allowances for the failure of a new president to be elected. if a new president has not been elected by the end of a president's term, or if 30 days elapse following a vacancy, some powers are conferred upon the prime minister, some are moved to the chairman of the chamber of deputies or to the chairman of the senate, if parliament is in a state of dissolution at the time of the vacancy.the first direct presidential election in the czech republic was held 11–12 january 2013, with a runoff on 25–26 january.


=== previous electoral procedure (until 1 october 2012) ===
under article 58 of the current czech constitution, nominees to the office must be put forward by no fewer than 10 deputies or 10 senators. once nominees are in place, a ballot can begin. each ballot can have at most three rounds. in the first round, a victorious candidate requires an absolute majority in both the chamber of deputies and the senate. given a 200-seat chamber and an 81-seat senate, a successful first-round candidate requires 101 deputies and 41 senators.if no single candidate gets a majority of both the chamber and the senate, a second round is then called for. at this stage, a candidate requires an absolute majority of merely those actually present at the time of voting in both the chamber of deputies and the senate. the actual number of votes required in the second round might be the same as in the first round, but as in 2008, it can be a little less, due to the absence of a few parliamentarians. nevertheless, in this second round, a single candidate would need to win a majority in both the chamber and the senate.
should no single candidate achieve a majority of both houses then present, a third round is necessitated. in this final round, which can happen within 14 days of the first round, an absolute majority of deputies and senators present suffices. at this stage, the individual houses of parliament are not considered separately. assuming that all members of parliament are present, all that is required to win is 141 votes, regardless of the house of origin. if no candidate wins in the third round, another ballot has to be considered in a subsequent joint session of parliament. the process continues under the same rules until a candidate prevails.
in 1993, the republic's first president, václav havel, had little difficulty achieving victory on the first round of the first ballot, but his re-election bid proved bumpier. in 1998, he was elected with a cumulative seven-vote margin on the second round of the first ballot. by contrast, his successor, václav klaus, has required the full measure of the process. he narrowly won election on the third ballot at the 2003 election and on the sixth (second attempt, third ballot) in 2008. both his elections were won in the third round. his biggest margin of victory was two votes.


=== dissatisfaction with previous procedure ===
following the 2003 and 2008 elections, which both required multiple ballots, some in the czech political community expressed dissatisfaction with this method of election. in 2008, martin bursík, leader of the czech green party, said of the 2008 vote, ""we are sitting here in front of the public somewhat muddied by backstage horse-trading, poorly concealed meetings with lobbyists and intrigue."" there were calls to adopt a system with a direct election, in which the public would be involved in the voting. however, opponents of this plan pointed out that the presidency had always been determined by indirect vote, going back through several predecessor states to the presidency of tomáš masaryk. charles university political scientist zdeněk zbořil suggested that direct voting could result in a president and prime minister who were hostile to each other's goals, leading to deadlock. a system of direct elections was supported by figures including jiří čunek (christian and democratic union – czechoslovak people's party) and jiří paroubek (czech social democratic party), whereas the ruling civic democratic party, under both president václav klaus and prime minister mirek topolánek, was more skeptical. topolánek commented that it was an advantage that ""our presidential elections are not preceded by some campaign, that is unavoidable in a direct election and causes rifts among citizens"". using poland as an unfavourable example, he said that ""when someone talks about how our method of selecting the head of state is undignified, he should first weigh the consequences of a direct vote"".


== removal from office ==
aside from death, there are only three things that can effect a president's removal from office:

a president can resign by notifying the president of the senate.
the president may be deemed unable to execute his duties for ""serious reasons"" by a joint resolution of the senate and the chamber – although the president may appeal to the constitutional court to have this resolution overturned.
the president may be impeached by the senate for high treason and convicted by the constitutional court.


== trappings of office ==


=== presidential fanfare ===
since the first czechoslovak president tomáš garrigue masaryk, the presidential fanfare has been the introduction to bedřich smetana's opera libuše, which is symbol of the patriotism of the czech people during the czech national revival under the austro-hungarian monarchy.


=== heraldry ===
the office of president carries with it an iconography, established through laws passed by the parliament. perhaps the most visible of these is the flag of the president, as seen at top right. his official motto is the same as that of the republic: ""pravda vítězí"" (""truth prevails"").
inasmuch as the president is the titular sole administrator of prague castle, the presidency may also be said to control the heraldry of that institution as well, including but not limited to the special designs worn by the castle guard, which is a special unit of the armed forces of the czech republic, organized under the military office of the president of the czech republic, directly subordinate to the president.
furthermore, the president, while in office, is entitled to wear the effects of the highest class of the republic's two ceremonial orders, the order of the white lion and the order of tomáš garrigue masaryk. by the power of being inaugurated, the president becomes the holder of the highest class of both orders for the duration of his term in office as well as their supreme administrator. by convention, the parliament allows a retiring president to remain a life-long member of both institutions, with the order decorations returning to the state upon the former president's death.


=== residences ===

the official residence of the president of the czech republic is prague castle. however, the living quarters are small and not particularly comfortable, so recent presidents (václav havel and václav klaus) have chosen to live elsewhere. the last president to reside more or less full-time in the residence in the prague castle was gustáv husák. the president also maintains a summer residence at the castle in the village of lány, 35 km west of prague.

intrahepatic bile duct epithelial cell,cell,"cholangiocarcinoma, also known as bile duct cancer, is a type of cancer that forms in the bile ducts. symptoms of cholangiocarcinoma may include abdominal pain, yellowish skin, weight loss, generalized itching, and fever. light colored stool or dark urine may also occur. other biliary tract cancers include gallbladder cancer and cancer of the ampulla of vater.risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma include primary sclerosing cholangitis (an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts), ulcerative colitis, cirrhosis, hepatitis c, hepatitis b, infection with certain liver flukes, and some congenital liver malformations. however, most people have no identifiable risk factors. the diagnosis is suspected based on a combination of blood tests, medical imaging, endoscopy, and sometimes surgical exploration. the disease is confirmed by examination of cells from the tumor under a microscope. it is typically an adenocarcinoma (a cancer that forms glands or secretes mucin).cholangiocarcinoma is typically incurable at diagnosis. in these cases palliative treatments may include surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and stenting procedures. in about a third of cases involving the common bile duct and less commonly with other locations the tumor can be completely removed by surgery offering a chance of a cure. even when surgical removal is successful chemotherapy and radiation therapy are generally recommended. in certain cases surgery may include a liver transplantation. even when surgery is successful 5-year survival is typically less than 50%.cholangiocarcinoma is rare in the western world, with estimates of it occurring in 0.5–2 people per 100,000 per year. rates are higher in south-east asia where liver flukes are common. rates in parts of thailand are 60 per 100,000 per year. it typically occurs in people in their 70s; however, in those with primary sclerosing cholangitis it often occurs in the 40s. rates of cholangiocarcinoma within the liver in the western world have increased.


== signs and symptoms ==

the most common physical indications of cholangiocarcinoma are abnormal liver function tests, jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin occurring when bile ducts are blocked by tumor), abdominal pain (30–50%), generalized itching (66%), weight loss (30–50%), fever (up to 20%), and changes in the color of stool or urine. to some extent, the symptoms depend upon the location of the tumor: people with cholangiocarcinoma in the extrahepatic bile ducts (outside the liver) are more likely to have jaundice, while those with tumors of the bile ducts within the liver more often have pain without jaundice.blood tests of liver function in people with cholangiocarcinoma often reveal a so-called ""obstructive picture"", with elevated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transferase levels, and relatively normal transaminase levels. such laboratory findings suggest obstruction of the bile ducts, rather than inflammation or infection of the liver parenchyma, as the primary cause of the jaundice.


== risk factors ==

although most people present without any known risk factors evident, a number of risk factors for the development of cholangiocarcinoma have been described. in the western world, the most common of these is primary sclerosing cholangitis (psc), an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts which is closely associated with ulcerative colitis (uc). epidemiologic studies have suggested that the lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma for a person with psc is on the order of 10–15%, although autopsy series have found rates as high as 30% in this population.certain parasitic liver diseases may be risk factors as well. colonization with the liver flukes opisthorchis viverrini (found in thailand, laos pdr, and vietnam) or clonorchis sinensis (found in china, taiwan, eastern russia, korea, and vietnam) has been associated with the development of cholangiocarcinoma. control programs aimed at discouraging the consumption of raw and undercooked food have been successful at reducing the incidence of cholangiocarcinoma in some countries. people with chronic liver disease, whether in the form of viral hepatitis (e.g. hepatitis b or hepatitis c), alcoholic liver disease, or cirrhosis of the liver due to other causes, are at significantly increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma. hiv infection was also identified in one study as a potential risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma, although it was unclear whether hiv itself or other correlated and confounding factors (e.g. hepatitis c infection) were responsible for the association.infection with the bacteria helicobacter bilis and helicobacter hepaticus species can cause biliary cancer.congenital liver abnormalities, such as caroli's syndrome (a specific type of five recognized choledochal cysts), have been associated with an approximately 15% lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma. the rare inherited disorders lynch syndrome ii and biliary papillomatosis have also been found to be associated with cholangiocarcinoma. the presence of gallstones (cholelithiasis) is not clearly associated with cholangiocarcinoma. however, intrahepatic stones (called hepatolithiasis), which are rare in the west but common in parts of asia, have been strongly associated with cholangiocarcinoma. exposure to thorotrast, a form of thorium dioxide which was used as a radiologic contrast medium, has been linked to the development of cholangiocarcinoma as late as 30–40 years after exposure; thorotrast was banned in the united states in the 1950s due to its carcinogenicity.


== pathophysiology ==

cholangiocarcinoma can affect any area of the bile ducts, either within or outside the liver. tumors occurring in the bile ducts within the liver are referred to as intrahepatic, those occurring in the ducts outside the liver are extrahepatic, and tumors occurring at the site where the bile ducts exit the liver may be referred to as perihilar. a cholangiocarcinoma occurring at the junction where the left and right hepatic ducts meet to form the common hepatic duct may be referred to eponymously as a klatskin tumor.although cholangiocarcinoma is known to have the histological and molecular features of an adenocarcinoma of epithelial cells lining the biliary tract, the actual cell of origin is unknown. recent evidence has suggested that the initial transformed cell that generates the primary tumor may arise from a pluripotent hepatic stem cell. cholangiocarcinoma is thought to develop through a series of stages – from early hyperplasia and metaplasia, through dysplasia, to the development of frank carcinoma – in a process similar to that seen in the development of colon cancer. chronic inflammation and obstruction of the bile ducts, and the resulting impaired bile flow, are thought to play a role in this progression.histologically, cholangiocarcinomas may vary from undifferentiated to well-differentiated. they are often surrounded by a brisk fibrotic or desmoplastic tissue response; in the presence of extensive fibrosis, it can be difficult to distinguish well-differentiated cholangiocarcinoma from normal reactive epithelium. there is no entirely specific immunohistochemical stain that can distinguish malignant from benign biliary ductal tissue, although staining for cytokeratins, carcinoembryonic antigen, and mucins may aid in diagnosis. most tumors (>90%) are adenocarcinomas.


== diagnosis ==


=== blood tests ===
there are no specific blood tests that can diagnose cholangiocarcinoma by themselves. serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) and ca19-9 are often elevated, but are not sensitive or specific enough to be used as a general screening tool. however, they may be useful in conjunction with imaging methods in supporting a suspected diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma.


=== abdominal imaging ===

ultrasound of the liver and biliary tree is often used as the initial imaging modality in people with suspected obstructive jaundice. ultrasound can identify obstruction and ductal dilatation and, in some cases, may be sufficient to diagnose cholangiocarcinoma. computed tomography (ct) scanning may also play an important role in the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma.


=== imaging of the biliary tree ===

while abdominal imaging can be useful in the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, direct imaging of the bile ducts is often necessary. endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp), an endoscopic procedure performed by a gastroenterologist or specially trained surgeon, has been widely used for this purpose. although ercp is an invasive procedure with attendant risks, its advantages include the ability to obtain biopsies and to place stents or perform other interventions to relieve biliary obstruction. endoscopic ultrasound can also be performed at the time of ercp and may increase the accuracy of the biopsy and yield information on lymph node invasion and operability. as an alternative to ercp, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (ptc) may be utilized. magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (mrcp) is a non-invasive alternative to ercp. some authors have suggested that mrcp should supplant ercp in the diagnosis of biliary cancers, as it may more accurately define the tumor and avoids the risks of ercp.


=== surgery ===

surgical exploration may be necessary to obtain a suitable biopsy and to accurately stage a person with cholangiocarcinoma. laparoscopy can be used for staging purposes and may avoid the need for a more invasive surgical procedure, such as laparotomy, in some people.


=== pathology ===
histologically, cholangiocarcinomas are classically well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas. immunohistochemistry is useful in the diagnosis and may be used to help differentiate a cholangiocarcinoma from hepatocellular carcinoma and metastasis of other gastrointestinal tumors. cytological scrapings are often nondiagnostic, as these tumors typically have a desmoplastic stroma and, therefore, do not release diagnostic tumor cells with scrapings.


=== staging ===
although there are at least three staging systems for cholangiocarcinoma (e.g. those of bismuth, blumgart, and the american joint committee on cancer), none have been shown to be useful in predicting survival. the most important staging issue is whether the tumor can be surgically removed, or whether it is too advanced for surgical treatment to be successful. often, this determination can only be made at the time of surgery.general guidelines for operability include:
absence of lymph node or liver metastases
absence of involvement of the portal vein
absence of direct invasion of adjacent organs
absence of widespread metastatic disease


== treatment ==
cholangiocarcinoma is considered to be an incurable and rapidly lethal disease unless all the tumors can be fully resected (cut out surgically). since the operability of the tumor can only be assessed during surgery in most cases, a majority of people undergo exploratory surgery unless there is already a clear indication that the tumor is inoperable. however, the mayo clinic has reported significant success treating early bile duct cancer with liver transplantation using a protocolized approach and strict selection criteria.adjuvant therapy followed by liver transplantation may have a role in treatment of certain unresectable cases. locoregional therapies including transarterial chemoembolization (tace), transarterial radioembolization (tare) and ablation therapies have a role in intrahepatic variants of cholangiocarcinoma to provide palliation or potential cure in people who are not surgical candidates.


=== adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy ===
if the tumor can be removed surgically, people may receive adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy after the operation to improve the chances of cure. if the tissue margins are negative (i.e. the tumor has been totally excised), adjuvant therapy is of uncertain benefit. both positive and negative results have been reported with adjuvant radiation therapy in this setting, and no prospective randomized controlled trials have been conducted as of march 2007. adjuvant chemotherapy appears to be ineffective in people with completely resected tumors. the role of combined chemoradiotherapy in this setting is unclear. however, if the tumor tissue margins are positive, indicating that the tumor was not completely removed via surgery, then adjuvant therapy with radiation and possibly chemotherapy is generally recommended based on the available data.


=== treatment of advanced disease ===
the majority of cases of cholangiocarcinoma present as inoperable (unresectable) disease in which case people are generally treated with palliative chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy. chemotherapy has been shown in a randomized controlled trial to improve quality of life and extend survival in people with inoperable cholangiocarcinoma. there is no single chemotherapy regimen which is universally used, and enrollment in clinical trials is often recommended when possible. chemotherapy agents used to treat cholangiocarcinoma include 5-fluorouracil with leucovorin, gemcitabine as a single agent, or gemcitabine plus cisplatin, irinotecan, or capecitabine. a small pilot study suggested possible benefit from the tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib in people with advanced cholangiocarcinoma.
radiation therapy appears to prolong survival in people with resected extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and the few reports of its use in unresectable cholangiocarcinoma appear to show improved survival, but numbers are small.


== prognosis ==
surgical resection offers the only potential chance of cure in cholangiocarcinoma. for non-resectable cases, the 5-year survival rate is 0% where the disease is inoperable because distal lymph nodes show metastases, and less than 5% in general. overall mean duration of survival is less than 6 months in people with metastatic disease.for surgical cases, the odds of cure vary depending on the tumor location and whether the tumor can be completely, or only partially, removed. distal cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the common bile duct) are generally treated surgically with a whipple procedure; long-term survival rates range from 15–25%, although one series reported a five-year survival of 54% for people with no involvement of the lymph nodes. intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the bile ducts within the liver) are usually treated with partial hepatectomy. various series have reported survival estimates after surgery ranging from 22–66%; the outcome may depend on involvement of lymph nodes and completeness of the surgery. perihilar cholangiocarcinomas (those occurring near where the bile ducts exit the liver) are least likely to be operable. when surgery is possible, they are generally treated with an aggressive approach often including removal of the gallbladder and potentially part of the liver. in patients with operable perihilar tumors, reported 5-year survival rates range from 20–50%.the prognosis may be worse for people with primary sclerosing cholangitis who develop cholangiocarcinoma, likely because the cancer is not detected until it is advanced. some evidence suggests that outcomes may be improving with more aggressive surgical approaches and adjuvant therapy.


== epidemiology ==

cholangiocarcinoma is a relatively rare form of cancer; each year, approximately 2,000 to 3,000 new cases are diagnosed in the united states, translating into an annual incidence of 1–2 cases per 100,000 people. autopsy series have reported a prevalence of 0.01% to 0.46%. there is a higher prevalence of cholangiocarcinoma in asia, which has been attributed to endemic chronic parasitic infestation. the incidence of cholangiocarcinoma increases with age, and the disease is slightly more common in men than in women (possibly due to the higher rate of primary sclerosing cholangitis, a major risk factor, in men). the prevalence of cholangiocarcinoma in people with primary sclerosing cholangitis may be as high as 30%, based on autopsy studies.multiple studies have documented a steady increase in the incidence of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma over the past several decades; increases have been seen in north america, europe, asia, and australia. the reasons for the increasing occurrence of cholangiocarcinoma are unclear; improved diagnostic methods may be partially responsible, but the prevalence of potential risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma, such as hiv infection, has also been increasing during this time frame.

dermis lymphatic vessel endothelial cell,cell,"stromal cells, or mesenchymal stromal cells, are differentiating cells found in abundance within bone marrow but can also be seen all around the body. stromal cells can become connective tissue cells of any organ, for example in the uterine mucosa (endometrium), prostate, bone marrow, lymph node and the ovary. they are cells that support the function of the parenchymal cells of that organ. the most common stromal cells include fibroblasts and pericytes. the term stromal comes from latin stromat-, ""bed covering"", and ancient greek στρῶμα, strôma, ""bed"".
stromal cells are an important part of the bodies immune response and modulate inflammation through multiple pathways. they also aid in differentiation of hematopoietic cells and forming necessary blood elements. the interaction between stromal cells and tumor cells is known to play a major role in cancer growth and progression. in addition, by regulating local cytokine networks (e.g. m-csf, lif), bone marrow stromal cells have been described to be involved in human hematopoiesis and inflammatory processes.
stromal cells (in the dermis layer) adjacent to the epidermis (the top layer of the skin) release growth factors that promote cell division. this keeps the epidermis regenerating from the bottom while the top layer of cells on the epidermis are constantly being ""sloughed"" off the body. additionally, stromal cells play a role in inflammation responses, and controlling the amount of cells accumulating at an inflamed region of tissue.


== defining a stromal cell ==
defining a stromal cell is of importance because it was a source of difficulty in the past. without a strong definition studies could not cross over or gain knowledge from each other because a stromal cell was not well defined and went by a plethora of names. a stromal cell is currently more specifically referred to as a mesenchymal stem cell (msc). it is non-hematopoietic, multipotent, and self-replicating. these factors make it an effective tool in potential cell therapies and tissue repair. being a mesenchymal cell indicates an ability to develop into various other cell types and tissues such as connective tissue, blood vessels, and lymphatic tissue. some stromal cells can be considered stem cells but not all therefore it can not be broadly termed a stem cell. all msc have the ability adhere to plastic and replicate by themselves. msc's have cell surface markers, but there are no universal list of the markers they are required to possess. there are typically a differentiation of cd73, cd90, cd105, cd44 as well as others that cover the cells surface. they also lack the expression of markers cd14, cd34, cd45, which can be important in the ability of stromal cells to remain fairly undetected by the immune system. low levels of human leukocyte antigen (hla-dr) make msc's hypoimmunogenic. msc's have trilineage differentiation where they are able to adapt into osteoblast, chondrocytes, and adipocytes. they can also display anti-inflammatory as well as proinflammatory responses allowing for the potential to help with a broad range of immune disorders and inflammatory diseases.


== sources of stromal cells ==
it is well known that stromal cells arise and are stored in the bone marrow until maturation and differentiation. they are located in the stroma and aid hematopoietic cells in forming the elements of the blood. while a majority is found in the bone marrow scientists now know that stromal cells can be found in a variety of different tissues as well. these can include adipose tissue, endometrium, synovial fluid, dental tissue, amniotic membrane and fluid, as well as the placenta. some of the most reliable stromal cells are located in the placenta because stromal cells age as we age. the older we get the weaker our msc's are, and the less applicable they are to be used as treatment.


== immunomodulatory effects ==


=== anti-inflammation ===
an important ability of msc's are their ability to suppress an excessive immune response. t-cells, b-cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, and natural killer cells can be overstimulated by the immune systems response, but stromal cells help to keep the balance and make sure the body can properly heal without an excessive amount of inflammation.
msc's release immunosuppressive mediators when an inflammatory response is stimulated. the mechanisms can include nitric oxide (no), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (ido), prostaglandin e2 (pge2), programmed death of ligand 1 (pd-l1) and many more. without msc's these factors are extremely limited and cause the immune response to happen quickly and without obstacles. however, without regulation there can be an overstimulation of the immune response and that is when msc's and their released factors are necessary. ifn-gamma stimulates the presence of msc's expressing ido. the ido catalyzes the conversion of tryptophan into kynurenine inhibiting the t-cells from further generation. the mechanism that utilizes no also decreases t-cell proliferation by not allowing monocytes to mature. immature monocytes remain as dendritic cells which leads to fewer t-cells being activated, and a positive feedback loop increases il-10 levels so the dendritic cells adopt a more anti-inflammatory phenotype.msc's specifically target the effector arm of t-cells and therefore can suppress the immune systems response to some degree. dendritic cells in the presence of msc's are immature and undifferentiated which causes impaired function to call upon t-cells and bridge the gap between the innate and adaptive immune responses. these dendritic cells instead release cytokines in order to regulate the growth and activity of other immune system cells as well as blood cells.when there is a high level of msc's during an immune response the generation of more b-cells is stunted. the b-cells that can still be produced are impacted by diminished antibody count production and chemotactic behavior. this reduction in b-cell proliferation is caused by the presence of ifn-gamma, stimulating ido on the surface of msc's and suppressing effector cells through the tryptophan pathway.


=== proinflammation ===
stromal cells are most often looked at for their hypoimmunogenic response but they are actually non specific immunomodulating. msc's can flip the switch between anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory based on their levels of ifn-gamma, tnf-alpha, and either +il-6 or -il-6. pathogens are initially recognized by toll-like receptors (tlr's). this triggers inflammatory mediators and activates either pro or anti inflammatory msc's. if ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha are present in high levels the msc will stimulate an anti-inflammatory response by activating cd4, cd25, foxp3, and treg cell instead of t-cells. however, if the levels of ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha are low the msc's produce low levels of ido and therefore can activate t-cells normally and the inflammation process takes place.  msc's with +il-6 in the presence of monocytes forms m2 and ccl-18 which inhibits t-cells from being activated. however, msc's with -il-6 in the presence of monocytes form m1 and can activate t-cells and produce high levels of ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha which regulates the inflammation through the previously mentioned mechanism.


== role in hematopoiesis ==
before differentiation a majority of msc's are housed within the bone marrow which is also where lymphocytes and other blood elements are formed. stromal cells play a large role in the distinction of hematopoietic cells (cells that can differentiate into other blood cells). msc's act as a physical support for differentiating hematopoietic cells in conjunction with the extracellular matrix. stromal cells also provide nutrients and growth factors for the hematopoietic cell to continue to develop. lastly, msc's express adhesion molecules that influence the hematopoietic cells differentiation. the body tells the msc's what blood elements are needed and it conveys those adhesion molecules to the differentiating cell.  


== in cancer ==
during normal wound healing processes, the local stromal cells change into reactive stroma after altering their phenotype. however, under certain conditions, tumor cells can convert these reactive stromal cells further and transition them into tumor-associated stromal cells (tascs). in comparison to non-reactive stromal cells, tacs secrete increased levels of proteins and matrix metalloproteinases (mmps). these proteins include fibroblast activating protein and alpha-smooth muscle actin. furthermore, tacs secrete many pro-tumorigenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf), stromal-derived factor-1 alpha, il-6, il-8, tenascin-c, and others. these factors are known to recruit additional tumor and pro-tumorigenic cells.
the cross-talk between the host stroma and tumor cells is essential for tumor growth and progression. tumor stromal production exhibits similar qualities as normal wound repair such as new blood vessel formation, immune cell and fibroblast infiltration, and considerable remodeling of the extracellular matrix. additionally, the recruitment of local normal host stromal cells, such as bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells, endothelial cells, and adipocytes, help create a conspicuously heterogeneous composition. furthermore, these cells secrete an abundance of factors that help regulate tumor development. potential targets for tumor-associated stromal cell recruitment have been identified in the following host tissue: bone marrow, connective tissue, adipose tissue, and blood vessels. moreover, evidence suggests that tumor-associated stroma are a prerequisite for metastasis and tumor cell invasion. these are known to arise from at least six different origins: immune cells, macrophages, adipocytes, fibroblasts, pericytes, and bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells.furthermore, the tumor stroma is primarily composed of the basement membrane, fibroblasts, extracellular matrix, immune cells, and blood vessels. typically, most host cells in the stroma are characterized by tumor-suppressive abilities. however, during malignancy, the stroma will undergo alterations to consequently incite growth, invasion, and metastasis. these changes include the formation of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (cafs) which comprises a major portion of the reactive tissue stroma and plays a critical role in regulating tumor progression.certain types of skin cancers (basal cell carcinomas) cannot spread throughout the body because the cancer cells require nearby stromal cells to continue their division. the loss of these stromal growth factors when the cancer moves throughout the body prevents the cancer from invading other organs.
stroma is made up of the non-malignant cells, but can provide an extracellular matrix on which tumor cells can grow. stromal cells may also limit t-cell proliferation via nitric oxide production, hindering immune capability.

== use in future therapies ==
msc's have the potential to be used in multiple disease interventions. one important feature of msc's is that they can go virtually undetected by the immune system. the stromal cells possess serine proteases which are an inhibitor of the immune response. they also do not carry receptors that relate to the immune system or are not in high enough concentrations to admit a response. this is helpful for the future of msc cell therapies because there will be little to no negative effects from a possible immune response. there is promising research in the fields of autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis as well as wound healing, copd, and even acute respiratory distress syndrome (an effect of covid-19). stromal cells have the unique ability to create an immune modulated environment in order to best respond to foreign and known particles. the reason for halted use of msc's is the lack of knowledge of the cells in vivo. most research of these cells have been done in controlled laboratory environments which can sometimes alter the effects seen. the potentials, however, for cell therapy in tissue repair, immune modulation, and anti-tumor agent distribution are promising.

ole glycosyltransferase,antibiotic,"oleandomycin is a macrolide antibiotic. it is synthesized from strains of streptomyces antibioticus. it is weaker than erythromycin.
it used to be sold under the brand name sigmamycine, combined with tetracycline, and  made by the company rosa-phytopharma in france.


== medical use and availability ==
oleandomycin can be employed to inhibit the activities of bacteria responsible for causing infections in the upper respiratory tract much like erythromycin can. both can affect staphylococcus and enterococcus genera.
the mic for oleandomycin is 0.3-3 µg/ml for staphylococcus aureus.oleandomycin is approved as a veterinary antibiotic in some countries. 
it has been approved as a swine and poultry antibiotic in the united states. however, it is currently only approved in the united states for production uses.


=== brand names ===
mastalone – oleandomycin, oxatetracycline, neomycin – zoetis australia and pfizer animal health
mastiguard – oleandomycin, oxatetracycline – stockguard animal healthformerly sold as sigmamycine by pfizer (oleandomycin + tetracycline + vitamin c)


== history ==


=== origins ===
oleandomycin was first discovered as a product of the bacterium streptomyces antibioticus in 1954 by dr. sobin, english, and celmer. in 1960, hochstein successfully managed to determine the structure of oleandomycin. this macrolide was discovered at around the same time as its relatives erythromycin and spiramycin.


=== combination drug sigmamycine ===
public interest in oleandomycin peaked when pfizer introduced the combination drug sigmamycine into the market in 1956. sigmamycine was a combination drug of oleandomycin and tetracycline that was supported by a major marketing campaign. it was in fact claimed that a 2:1 mixture of tetracycline and oleandomycin had a synergistic effect on staphylococci. it was also claimed that the mixture would be effective on organisms that are mostly resistant to tetracycline or oleandomycin alone. both of these claims were refuted by findings such as those by lawrence p. garrod that could find no evidence that such claims were properly substantiated. by the early 1970s, pfizer’s combination drugs were withdrawn from the market.


== pharmacology ==


=== mechanism of action ===
oleandomycin is a bacteriostatic agent. like erythromycin, oleandomycin binds to the 50s subunit of bacterial ribosomes, inhibiting the completion of proteins vital to survival and replication.  
it interferes with translational activity but also with 50s subunit formation.
however, unlike erythromycin and its effective synthetic derivatives, it lacks a 12-hydroxyl group and a 3-methoxy group. this change in structure may adversely affect its interactions with 50s structures and explain why it is a less powerful antibiotic.


=== relative strength ===
oleandomycin is far less effective than erythromycin in bacterial minimum inhibitory concentration tests involving staphylococci or enterococci.
however, macrolide antibiotics can accumulate in organs or cells and this effect can prolong the bioactivity of this category of antibiotics even if its concentration in plasma is below what is considered capable of a therapeutic effect.


== chemistry ==


=== polyketide synthesis ===

the oleandomycin synthase (oles) follows the module structure of a type i synthase. the polyketide chain is bound through thioester linkages to the s-h groups of the acp and ks domains (not shown).

the gene cluster oles1 codes for modules 0-2, module 0 containing an acetyl-coa starter unit and all remaining moduless carrying a methyl malonyl-coa elongation unit attached to its keto synthase unit.
oles2 codes for modules 3 and 4. module 3 is notable for potentially carrying a redox-inactive ketoreductase that is responsible for retaining the unreduced carbonyl adjacent to carbon 8.
oles3 codes for modules 5 and 6.the amino acid sequence similarities between oles and 6-deoxyerythronolide b synthase (erythromycin precursor synthase) show only a 45% common identity. note that unlike in the erythromycin precursor synthase, there is a ks in the loading domain of oles.


=== post-pks tailoring ===

the genes oleg1 and g2 are responsible for the glycosyltransferases that attach oleandomycin’s characteristic sugars to the macrolide. these sugars are derived from tdp-glucose. oleg1 transfers dtdp-d-desoamine and oleg2 transfers d-tdp-l-oleandrose to the macrolide ring. the epoxidation that occurs afterwards is from the enzyme encoded by olep, which could be homologous with a p450 enzyme. the method by which olep epoxidates is suspected to be a dihydroxylation followed by the conversion of a hydroxyl group into a phosphate group that then leaves via a nucleophilic ring closure by the other hydroxyl group.

wrky transcription factor 1 isoform 1 (arabidopsis thaliana),protein,"the family of heterochromatin protein 1 (hp1)  (""chromobox homolog"", cbx) consists of highly conserved proteins, which have important functions in the cell nucleus. these functions include gene repression by heterochromatin formation, transcriptional activation, regulation of binding of cohesion complexes to centromeres, sequestration of genes to nuclear periphery, transcriptional arrest,  maintenance of heterochromatin integrity, gene repression at the single nucleosome level, gene repression by heterochromatization of euchromatin and dna repair. hp1 proteins are fundamental units of heterochromatin packaging that are enriched at the centromeres and telomeres of nearly all eukaryotic chromosomes with the notable exception of budding yeast, in which a yeast-specific silencing complex of sir (silent information regulatory) proteins serve a similar function. members of the hp1 family are characterized by an n-terminal chromodomain and a c-terminal chromoshadow domain, separated by a hinge region. hp1 is also found at euchromatic sites, where its binding correlates with gene repression. hp1 was originally discovered by tharappel c james and sarah elgin in 1986 as a factor in the phenomenon known as position effect variegation in drosophila melanogaster.


== paralogs and orthologs ==
three different paralogs of hp1 are found in drosophila melanogaster, hp1a, hp1b and hp1c. subsequently orthologs of hp1 were also discovered in s. pombe (swi6), xenopus (xhp1α and xhp1γ) and chicken (chcb1, chcb2 and chcb3) and tetrahymena (pdd1p). in mammals, there are three paralogs: hp1α, hp1β and hp1γ. in arabidopsis thaliana (a plant), there is one homolog: like heterochromatin protein 1 (lhp1), also known as terminal flower 2 (tfl2).


=== hp1β in mammals ===

hp1β interacts with the histone methyltransferase (hmtase) suv(3-9)h1 and is a component of both pericentric and telomeric heterochromatin. hp1β is a dosage-dependent modifier of pericentric heterochromatin-induced silencing and silencing is thought to involve a dynamic association of the hp1β chromodomain with the tri-methylated histone h3 me(3)k9h3.


== interacting proteins ==
hp1 seems to interact with numerous other proteins/molecules with different cellular functions in different organisms. some of these hp1 interacting partners are: histone h1, histone h3, methylated k9 histone h3, histone h4, histone methyltransferase, dna methyltransferase, methyl cpg binding protein mecp2, and the origin recognition complex protein orc2.


== binding affinity and cooperativity ==
hp1 has a versatile structure with three main components; a chromodomain, a chromoshadow domain, and a hinge domain. the chromodomain is responsible for the specific binding affinity of hp1 to histone h3 when tri-methylated at the 9th lysine residue. hp1 binding affinity to nucleosomes containing histone h3 methylated at lysine k9 is higher than to those with unmethylated lysine k9. hp1 binds nucleosomes as a dimer and in principle can form multimeric complexes. some studies have interpreted hp1 binding in terms of nearest-neighbor cooperative binding. however, the analysis of available data on hp1 binding to nucleosomal arrays in vitro shows that experimental hp1 binding isotherms can be explained by a simple model without cooperative interactions between neighboring hp1 dimers. nevertheless, favorable interactions between nearest neighbors of hp1 lead to limited spreading of hp1 and its marks along the nucleosome chain in vivo.the binding affinity of the hp1 chromodomain has also been implicated in regulation of alternative splicing. hp1 can act as both an enhancer and silencer of splicing alternative exons. the exact role it plays in regulation varies by gene and is dependent on the methylation patterns within the gene body. in humans, the role of hp1 on splicing has been characterized for alternative splicing of the eda exon from the fibronectin gene. in this pathway hp1 acts as a mediator protein for repression of alternative splicing of the eda exon. when the chromatin within the gene body is not methylated, hp1 does not bind and the eda exon is transcribed. when the chromatin is methylated, hp1 binds the chromatin and recruits the splicing factor srsf3 which binds hp1 and splices the eda exon from the mature transcript. in this mechanism hp1 recognizes the h3k9me3 methylated chromatin and recruits a splicing factor to alternatively splice the mrna, thereby excluding the eda exon from the mature transcript.


== role in dna repair ==
all hp1 isoforms (hp1-alpha, hp1-beta, and hp1-gamma) are recruited to dna at sites of uv-induced damages, at oxidative damages and at dna breaks.  the hp1 protein isoforms are required for dna repair of these damages.  the presence of the hp1 protein isoforms at dna damages assists with the recruitment of other proteins involved in subsequent dna repair pathways.  the recruitment of the hp1 isoforms to dna damage is rapid, with half maximum recruitment (t1/2) by 180 seconds in response to uv damage, and a t1/2 of 85 seconds in response to double-strand breaks.  this is a bit slower than the recruitment  of the very earliest proteins recruited to sites of dna damage, though hp1 recruitment is still one of the very early steps in dna repair.  other earlier proteins may be recruited with a t1/2 of 40 seconds for uv damage and a t1/2 of about 1 second in response to double-strand breaks (see dna damage response).

tolerantia,non_science,"a letter concerning toleration by john locke was originally published in 1689. its initial publication was in latin, and it was immediately translated into other languages. locke's work appeared amidst a fear that catholicism might be taking over england, and responds to the problem of religion and government by proposing religious toleration as the answer. this ""letter"" is addressed to an anonymous ""honored sir"": this was actually locke's close friend philipp van limborch, who published it without locke's knowledge.


== background ==
in the wake of discovery of the rye house plot and charles ii's persecution of the whigs, locke fled england to amsterdam, holland in september 1683. throughout his life, locke had taken an interest in the debate about religious toleration. the question was much debated in holland during locke's stay and in october 1685 louis xiv of france revoked the edict of nantes that had guaranteed religious toleration for french protestants.in holland, locke met philipp van limborch, a professor of divinity, and it was to be a discussion with limborch that persuaded locke to temporarily put aside his work on an essay concerning human understanding and put forth his ideas on toleration. locke wrote the letter during the winter of 1685-86.


== argument of the letter ==
one of the founders of empiricism, locke develops a philosophy that is contrary to the one expressed by thomas hobbes in leviathan, in supporting toleration for various christian denominations. hobbes did allow for individuals to maintain their own religious beliefs as long as they outwardly expressed those of the state, however, and it has been argued that locke's rejection of catholic imperialism was the ultimate basis for his rejection of government's interest in spiritual salvation.unlike hobbes, who saw uniformity of religion as the key to a well-functioning civil society, locke argues that more religious groups actually prevent civil unrest. locke argues that civil unrest results from confrontations caused by any magistrate's attempt to prevent different religions from being practiced, rather than tolerating their proliferation. locke's primary goal is to ""distinguish exactly the business of civil government from that of religion."" he seeks to persuade the reader that government is instituted to promote external interests, relating to life, liberty, and the general welfare, while the church exists to promote internal interests, i.e., salvation. the two serve separate functions, and so, must be considered to be separate institutions.
for locke, the only way a church can gain genuine converts is through persuasion and not through violence. this relates to his central conclusion, namely, that the government should not involve itself in care of souls. in support of this argument he presents three main reasons: (1) individuals, according to locke, cannot divest control over their souls to secular forces, as god does not appoint the magistrate; (2) force cannot create the change necessary for salvation, because while it can coerce obedience, it cannot change one's beliefs; and (3) even if coercion could persuade someone of a notion, it would not help with ensuring salvation, because there is no reason to believe that magistrates are reliable judges of religious truth.
locke argued that those who believed that ""faith need not be kept with heretics"" and that ""kings excommunicated forfeit their kingdoms""
had ""no right to be tolerated by the magistrate"". neither did ""those who refuse to teach that dissenters from their own religion should be tolerated"". this was because those who believed such doctrines would, given the opportunity,
attack the laws and the liberty and property of the citizens. these people, locke argued, sought religious toleration ""only until they have supplies and forces enough to make the attempt"" on liberty. the doctrines that ""faith need not be kept with heretics"" and that ""kings excommunicated forfeit their kingdoms"" were commonly held to be catholic beliefs by protestants. during his visit to france in 1676, locke recorded that the belief that ""faith does not have to be kept with heretics"" was an important factor in the intolerance shown to the protestant huguenots.""that church can have no right to be tolerated by the magistrate,"" locke argued, ""which is so constituted that all who enter it ipso facto pass into the allegiance and service of another prince"". if this were to be tolerated, ""the magistrate would make room for a foreign jurisdiction in his own territory and...allow for his own people to be enlisted as soldiers against his own government"". this has been interpreted by historians as a reference to the catholic church, with the pope being the prince to whom catholics owed allegiance.however, more recently scholars have challenged the idea that locke opposed the toleration of catholics in all circumstances. mark goldie argues that the traditional interpretation of locke's position on catholics ""needs finessing, since he did not, in fact, exclude the theoretical possibility of tolerating catholics...if catholics could discard their uncivil beliefs, they could then be tolerated"". goldie asserts that locke was opposed not to catholicism as such but antinomianism, the belief that ordinary moral laws are superseded by religious truth. scott sowerby also claims that locke left open the possibility that catholics could be tolerated if they adopted tolerant principles and rejected political allegiance to the pope.john marshall has argued that a number of passages in the letter demonstrate that locke believed that catholics ""in their terms of worship and religious speculative beliefs...deserved their worship to be free"". marshall also notes that ""the combination of locke’s comments in the letter suggest that during [its] composition ... locke was once again struggling over how to discriminate between the series of associated political principles which for him made catholics intolerable, and the religious worship and other religious beliefs of catholics which deserved toleration."" a confirmation of these positions seems to come from a 2019 discovery of a previously unknown manuscript, dated to 1667-8, titled reason for tolerateing papists equally with others, in which locke makes his earliest arguments for religious toleration.locke argued that atheists should not be tolerated because ""promises, covenants, and oaths, which are the bonds of human society, can have no hold upon or sanctity for an atheist"".  there is, however,  a passage added in a later edition of the essay concerning human understanding, where locke perhaps questioned ""whether 'atheism' was necessarily inimical to political obedience.""toleration is central to locke's political philosophy. consequently, only churches that teach toleration are to be allowed in his society. locke’s view on the difficulty of knowing the one true religion may suggest that religion is not personally important to locke, but it also may point to the deep uncertainties surrounding religious belief in a time of political and intellectual conflict. in contrast, locke’s view on atheism suggests that he was far from considering religion as unimportant. as an empiricist, he took practical considerations into account, such as how the peace of civil society will be affected by religious toleration. a close reading of the text also reveals that locke relies on biblical analysis at several key points in his argument.


== reception ==
there were immediate responses from the high church anglican clergy, published by thomas long and jonas proast. long believed the letter was written by an atheistically disguised jesuit plot for the roman catholic church to gain dominance by bringing chaos and ruin to church and state. proast attacked the letter and defended the view that the government has the right to use force to cause dissenters to reflect on the merits of anglicanism, the true religion.  locke's reply to proast developed into an extended, controversial exchange.

phenylbutyrate oral powder,drug,"sodium phenylbutyrate is a salt of an aromatic fatty acid, 4-phenylbutyrate (4-pba) or 4-phenylbutyric acid. the compound is used to treat urea cycle disorders, because its metabolites offer an alternative pathway to the urea cycle to allow excretion of excess nitrogen. it is an orphan drug, marketed by ucyclyd pharma under the trade name buphenyl, by swedish orphan international (sweden) as ammonaps, and by fyrlklövern scandinavia as tributyrate.
sodium phenylbutyrate is also a histone deacetylase inhibitor and chemical chaperone, leading respectively to research into its use as an anti-cancer agent and in protein misfolding diseases such as cystic fibrosis.


== structure and properties ==
sodium phenylbutyrate is a sodium salt of an aromatic fatty acid, made up of an aromatic ring and butyric acid. the chemical name for sodium phenylbutyrate is 4-phenylbutyric acid, sodium salt. it forms water-soluble off-white crystals.


== uses ==


=== medical uses ===
sodium phenylbutyrate is taken orally or by nasogastric intubation as a tablet or powder, and tastes very salty and bitter. it treats urea cycle disorders, genetic diseases in which nitrogen waste builds up in the blood plasma as ammonia glutamine (a state called hyperammonemia) due to deficiences in the enzymes carbamoyl phosphate synthetase i, ornithine transcarbamylase, or argininosuccinic acid synthetase. uncontrolled, this causes mental retardation and early death. sodium phenylbutyrate metabolites allows the kidneys to excrete excess nitrogen in place of urea, and coupled with dialysis, amino acid supplements and a protein-restricted diet, children born with urea cycle disorders can usually survive beyond 12 months. patients may need treatment for all their life. the treatment was introduced by researchers in the 1990s, and approved by the u.s. food and drugs administration (fda) in april 1996.


==== adverse effects ====
nearly ​1⁄4 of women may experience an adverse effect of amenorrhea or menstrual dysfunction. appetite loss is seen is 4% of patients. body odor due to metabolization of pheylbutyrate affects 3% of patients, and 3% experience unpleasant tastes. gastrointestinal symptoms and mostly mild indications of neurotoxicity are also seen in less than 2% of patients, among several other reported adverse effects. administration during pregnancy is not recommended because sodium phenylbutyrate treatment could mimic maternal phenylketonuria due to the production of phenylalanine, potentially causing fetal brain damage.


=== research ===


==== urea cycle disorders ====
sodium phenylbutyrate administration was discovered to lead to an alternative nitrogen disposal pathway by dr. saul brusilow, mark batshaw and colleagues at the johns hopkins school of medicine in the early 1980s, due to some serendipitous discoveries. they had studied ketoacid therapy for another inborn error of metabolism, citrullinemia, in the late 1970s and they noticed that arginine treatment led to an increase of nitrogen in the urine and a drop in ammonia in the blood. the researchers spoke to norman radin about this finding, and he remembered a 1914 article on using sodium benzoate to reduce urea excretion. another 1919 article had used sodium phenylacetate, and so the researchers treated 5 patients with hyperammonemia with benzoate and phenylacetate and published a report in science. in 1982 and 1984, the researchers published on using benzoate and arginine for urea cycle disorders in the nejm. use of sodium phenylbutyrate was introduced in the early 1990s, as it lacks the odor of phenylacetate.


==== chemical chaperone ====
in cystic fibrosis, a point mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein, δf508-cftr, causes it to be unstable and misfold, hence trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum and unable to reach the cell membrane. this lack of cftr in the cell membrane leads to disrupted chloride transport and the symptoms of cystic fibrosis. sodium phenylbutyrate can act as a chemical chaperone, stabilising the mutant cftr in the endoplasmic reticulum and allowing it to reach the cell surface.


==== histone deacetylase inhibitor ====
deriving from its activity as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, sodium phenylbutyrate is under investigation for use as a potential differentiation-inducing agent in malignant glioma and acute myeloid leukaemia, and also for the treatment of some sickle-cell disorders as an alternative to hydroxycarbamide due it inducing expression of fetal hemoglobin to replace missing adult hemoglobin. while small-scale investigation is proceeding, there is to date no published data to support the use of the compound in the clinical treatment of cancer, and it remains under limited investigation. sodium phenylbutyrate is also being studied as a therapeutic option for the treatment of huntington's disease.


==== other ====
phenylbutyrate has been associated with longer lifespans in drosophila.university of colorado researchers dr. curt freed and wenbo zhou demonstrated that phenylbutyrate stops the progression of parkinson's disease in mice by turning on a gene called dj-1 that can protect dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain from dying. as of july 2011 they plan on testing phenylbutyrate for the treatment of parkinson's disease in humans.


== pharmacology ==

phenylbutyrate is a prodrug. in the human body it is first converted to phenylbutyryl-coa and then metabolized by mitochondrial beta-oxidation, mainly in the liver and kidneys, to the active form, phenylacetate. phenylacetate conjugates with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is eliminated with the urine. it contains the same amount of nitrogen as urea, which makes it an alternative to urea for excreting nitrogen.a 5g tablet or powder of sodium phenylbutyrate taken by mouth can be detected in the blood within 15 minutes, and reaches peak concentration in the bloodstream within an hour. it is metabolized into phenylacetate within half an hour.

renewable heat incentive scandal,non_science,"the renewable heat incentive scandal (rhi scandal), also referred to as rhigate and the cash for ash scandal, is a political scandal in northern ireland that centres on a failed renewable energy (wood pellet burning) incentive scheme that has been reported to potentially cost the public purse almost £500 million. the plan, initiated in 2012, was overseen by arlene foster of the democratic unionist party (dup), the then-minister for enterprise, trade and investment. foster failed to introduce proper cost controls, allowing the plan to spiral out of control. the scheme worked by paying applicants to use renewable energy. however,  the rate paid was more than the cost of the fuel, and thus many applicants were making profits simply by heating their properties.the political scandal first came to light in november 2016, by which point foster had become northern ireland's first minister. foster refused to resign or stand aside during any inquiry, saying that to do so would be seen as admitting to some culpability in the matter.the affair ultimately caused sinn féin's martin mcguinness to resign in protest as deputy first minister of northern ireland in january 2017 after ten years in office, citing foster's refusal to stand aside from her role while an investigation took place, among other matters. in the power-sharing government, mcguinness' resignation also meant that foster was removed from her role as first minister, which in turn caused the executive office of northern ireland to collapse for the subsequent three years.
on 16 january 2017, sinn féin refused to re-nominate a deputy first minister in protest at what they called the ""arrogance and disrespect of the dup"", thereby triggering a snap election. the northern ireland executive collapsed and the northern ireland assembly was dissolved on 26 january 2017. the 2017 northern ireland assembly election was held on 2 march, but did not lead to formation of a new executive. on 11 january 2020, after having been suspended for almost three years, the parties reconvened on the basis of an agreement proposed by the irish and uk governments. an inquiry into the affair commenced on 1 february 2017 and issued its report on 13 march 2020.


== background ==


=== politics of northern ireland ===

since 1998, northern ireland has had a devolved government within the united kingdom. the northern ireland assembly and the northern ireland executive together make up the legislative and executive branches of the northern ireland government. members of the legislative assembly (mlas) must self-identify as a particular designation: ""unionist"", ""nationalist"", or ""other"". under the terms of the northern ireland act 1998, 30 members may submit a ""petition of concern"" to the speaker of the assembly on any motion or proposed legislation, making it subject to approval by cross-community vote. motions subject to a cross-community vote, either by standing orders or by a petition of concern, require support from both a majority of unionists and a majority of nationalists.
the northern ireland executive is jointly led by a first minister and deputy first minister who are nominated by the largest parties of each of the two designations. in 2016, these parties were the democratic unionist party and sinn féin. because the office of first minister and deputy first minister is a joint one under northern irish law, the resignation of either vacates the whole office. if the office cannot be filled after a seven-day period, the entire assembly is dissolved and a new assembly election must be called.


=== history ===

the rhi scheme in northern ireland was managed and set up by the then department of enterprise, trade and investment (deti) in 2012 and was overseen by arlene foster, the deti minister at the time. the intention of the scheme was for businesses and non-domestic properties to begin using renewable heating sources such as wood pellets by offering them generous subsidies.in the northern ireland programme for government (pfg), the executive set out targets for renewable energy. it hoped that 4% of heat would come from renewable resources in 2015 with a further target of 10% in 2020. the rhi scheme offered incentives so that businesses and non-domestic users would change to renewable energy, which includes biomass boilers, solar pumps and heat pumps.the scheme was approved by executive ministers to meet the programme for government target. the scheme was budgeted at £25 million for 2011–2015. the scheme offered to cover the cost of the fuel and the boilers and to leave a margin of approximately 12%. the scheme effectively paid people to heat properties, so long as they used renewable energy to do so. the lack of cost controls encouraged applicants to profit from using excess energy.in the period 2014–2015, there was an underspend of £15 million as there was a lack of uptake. from april 2015 applications increased ""significantly"". after officials announced changes to the scheme, 984 applications were received from september 2015 to november 2015, which was before the changes announced were due to take place. the scheme was closed in february 2016 by jonathan bell, successor to foster as minister of deti. he said that it was closed ""in view of the significant financial risk to the northern ireland block grant for the next 20 years"".


==== fraud ====
concerns of fraud were raised initially in 2013 and again in 2014, when a whistleblower contacted foster to raise concerns about the scheme. the whistleblower stated that the scheme was ""flawed"" and the concerns of civil servants ""were ignored"" after she reported abuse of the scheme, as property owners were taking advantage of the scheme by heating properties that were previously unheated. it is claimed that the team, which comprised ten officials, investigated the whistleblower's claims and ""did not believe the informant"" and did not report back to foster.another whistleblower wrote a letter in january 2016 to tell foster, who had by then become first minister, about an ""empty"" farm shed that was ""being heated for the subsidy"". the scheme did not take into account that properties that were not previously heated could now be heated for a profit.
the lack of cost control led to the northern ireland executive committing a figure of £490m, based on the niao report 2015/16, to the scheme over 20 years. hm treasury contacted the executive in light of the huge bill and said that the executive would have to find the funds for it. the projected £490m spend would be spread over 20 years, as the participants of the scheme signed contracts with deti and their payments were to last for 20 years. when news first broke of the botched scheme, it was originally thought that the total cost to the budget would be £400m, but this was later revised up to £490m. northern ireland receives a block payment each year from hm treasury, and the block payment will need to be adjusted as a result of the money committed to the scheme.
arlene foster left deti and became minister for finance, leaving jonathan bell to succeed her as deti minister. after news of the affair broke, bell said on the bbc radio ulster programme the nolan show that dup special advisers and foster ""intervened"" to prevent the closure of the scheme. he also claimed that foster tried to ""cleanse the records"" by hiding her involvement in delaying the scheme's closure. in the period that he says he tried to close the scheme and the scheme's actual closure, there was a spike in applications which caused more money to be allocated to the scheme. after the interview, bell was suspended from the dup.


=== investigation ===
a total of 1,946 applications had been received by deti for the scheme. 98% of applicants received by deti were approved. after civil servants started to discuss closing the scheme, an additional 948 applications were made between september and november 2015. this enabled the applications to be determined before any changes to the scheme took place.stormont's public accounts committee (pac) opened an investigation into the scheme because the scheme ran over its budget and because of the spike in applications. an independent audit inspected 300 sites which benefited from the scheme, and the audit revealed that there were issues at half of those, although poultry and mushroom producers were found to be operating within the remit of the scheme. the audit also indicated that there were serious fraud issues at 14 of the sites and payments to 2 of those sites were subsequently suspended.the northern ireland assembly was recalled on 19 december 2016 to discuss the issue at the request of foster and martin mcguinness, the deputy first minister.


== public dispute between foster and bell ==

jonathan bell became deti minister after foster was promoted.  as details of the scheme were released to the public, foster came under increasing pressure because she was the minister who had initially conceived it.  she apologised for the lack of cost control, but accused bell of prolonging the scheme's closure.  in response bell gave an interview to the nolan show, broadcast on bbc one northern ireland.  in it he accused the dup's special advisers of trying to compel him to keep the scheme open. he claimed that they were not allowing time to close the scheme at its peak.  he named timothy johnston, special adviser to then first minister peter robinson, and andrew crawford, one of foster's aides.  bell accused foster publicly of trying to ""cleanse records"" to remove evidence of her interference.  he also called for a public inquiry into the matter.during the last three months of the scheme it attracted almost 1,000 applications, even though the minister claimed he had tried to close it. these three months are significant as bell was not in ministerial post, due to the dup's rolling resignations in 2015. on the same episode of the nolan show, foster responded to bell's allegations and gave her side of the story.  she professed to be unaware of bell's allegations.  nolan shared some of the allegations with her in the interview. she accused bell of using ""his physical bulk"" to confront her referring to him as being ""very aggressive"". dup party officers formally suspended bell from the party for talking to the media without prior permission.


== political reaction ==
there were calls on foster to quit and mounting pressure on her to do so from stormont's opposition parties after it was claimed that dr andrew crawford, her special advisor, had not received correspondence relating to concerns over the rhi scheme. there were public protests in belfast and in derry calling for foster to resign as first minister.


=== recall of northern ireland assembly ===
on 19 december 2016, the northern ireland assembly was recalled from recess in order for foster to give a statement to the chamber regarding the scandal. the opposition parties submitted a motion to exclude foster from office for six months.
there was disagreement in the chamber as it turned out that foster did not have martin mcguinness' approval for the statement to be read. in northern ireland, the first minister and deputy first minister are joint roles. mlas tried to raise points of order with the speaker, robin newton (dup), who did not allow them to speak. mlas walked out of the chamber in protest and newton suspended the sitting for 30 minutes.as the speaker allowed foster to address the chamber in her capacity as first minister without the consent of the deputy first minister, all other parties walked out of the chamber in protest at the beginning of her statement. she gave the statement with only her own party present and, as a result, she only received questions from her party colleagues.


=== vote of no confidence ===
the social democratic and labour party (sdlp), ulster unionist party (uup), alliance party, people before profit (pbp), traditional unionist voice (tuv), and the green party signed a ministerial exclusion motion under section 30 of the northern ireland act 1998, which would formally remove foster from office. although the opposition had a majority in the subsequent motion of no confidence, the motion did not pass because of stormont's cross-community procedures. this section was intended for removing politicians from office if they became involved in paramilitary activities.
colum eastwood, sdlp leader, said that foster ""should follow the precedent set by her predecessor and resign to restore confidence in the office of first minister while these questions hang over her"". uup leader mike nesbitt called for the mlas to ""come together and protect the reputation of the institutions"".after three hours of debate, a division was called and mlas voted on the motion. of the 75 members voting, 39 voted to exclude her from office, while 36 mlas voted against. although a 52% majority had thus supported the vote of no confidence, under stormont rules, the vote was a cross-community vote that required the majority of nationalist mlas and unionist mlas to support it. 100% of nationalist mlas, but only 29% of unionist mlas, voted to exclude foster, meaning that foster survived the vote of no confidence. sinn féin's mlas did not vote. as the dup is the largest unionist party in stormont, it effectively has a veto on cross-community issues, meaning that some of foster's own mlas would have to vote against her for the vote to succeed.
sinn féin announced their intention to table another motion in january 2017, which would call on foster to ""step aside"" whilst an independent inquiry takes place, but foster rejected any suggestion of her stepping aside. after the vote, sinn féin announced that they would put a motion to the assembly in january 2017 that would call for foster to step aside from her role. northern irish legislation allows for a first minister to step aside for six weeks. former first minister peter robinson and former deputy first minister martin mcguinness have done this in the past.


=== impartiality of the speaker ===
the constitutional impartiality of the speaker was called into question by opposition parties because he allowed foster to make a ministerial statement without agreement with sinn féin.  as foster and mcguinness hold equal roles, they both must agree on issues before acting in their capacities as first and deputy first ministers.  newton, who is also a dup mla, said he took speaker's independence ""extremely seriously"". mlas complained that he had ""undermined the principles of power-sharing by permitting the first minister to speak without the agreement of the deputy first minister"".  sinn féin were equally incensed by the speaker's blatant politicking making his position ""untenable"" as a result of the ""shambolic proceedings"". newton also faced calls to resign from the uup and sdlp. sinn féin announced that they would lodge a motion of no confidence in the speaker. declan kearney, the party's national chairperson, called for newton to resign with immediate effect.on 16 january 2017, the dup launched a petition of concern in the assembly to protect the speaker from sinn féin's motion of no confidence. 30 mlas are required to sign a petition of concern and, when a petition of concern is deployed, any votes taken are subject to a cross-community vote. as the dup hold the majority of unionist seats, they effectively blocked the motion from passing. in protest sinn féin retracted their motion of no confidence calling the abuse of the petition of concern ""insulting"".  sinn féin mla conor murphy alleged that the dup ""invoked the petition of concern to protect the speaker"" and said that ""the dup are corrupting the institutions in their own interests and against the wishes of the general public"".


=== resignation of martin mcguinness ===

on 8 january 2017, gerry adams, sinn féin president, called on foster to step aside and said that her refusal to do so was ""unacceptable"". he hinted that martin mcguinness could resign over the scandal. under stormont rules, a resignation of either the first minister or deputy first minister automatically means that both offices are declared vacant simultaneously.the following day, mcguinness travelled to stormont to announce his resignation as deputy first minister of northern ireland. mcguinness was seriously ill and travelled from altnagelvin area hospital in derry to sign his resignation letter. his resignation meant that arlene foster could not continue in her position as first minister. standing orders allowed sinn féin seven days to nominate another deputy first minister to restore the executive office. if sinn féin failed to nominate, the northern ireland assembly would be dissolved and the northern ireland executive would collapse and a snap election would be called by the secretary of state for northern ireland. mcguinness said that foster had a ""clear conflict of interest"" and it ""was the right time to call a halt to the dup's arrogance"". he further accused the dup of refusing to accept demands ""for robust action and responsibility"".as sinn féin did not nominate a replacement for mcguinness, james brokenshire automatically assumed control of northern ireland in his role as secretary of state for northern ireland on 16 january 2017. brokenshire was obliged to call an election within a ""reasonable time period"", which he announced for 2 march 2017. per the stormont house agreement, the 2017 assembly election elected only 90 mlas.
under power sharing rules in northern ireland, foster was unable to continue in her role as first minister while there was a vacancy for the deputy first minister. this meant that foster lost her role when mcguinness' resignation came into effect. the executive office therefore became vacant on 9 january 2017.
there were allegations from the dup that mcguinness' resignation was due to his ill health, and purely for ""party political reasons"" according to foster.mcguinness died on 21 march 2017, two months after his resignation.


=== british and irish governments' intervention ===
on 10 january 2017, it was revealed that british prime minister theresa may and irish taoiseach enda kenny had a telephone conversation to discuss the ""ongoing crisis"" at stormont. the british and irish governments ""urged"" sinn féin and the dup to enter talks to resolve the dispute.
irish foreign minister charles flanagan spoke to brokenshire regarding the situation and flanagan urged all sides ""to act responsibly to protect the institutions of the 1998 good friday agreement"".brokenshire gave a statement to the house of commons and described the situation as ""grave"". he said that the british government is treating it ""with the utmost seriousness"". brokenshire said that there was a widely held view that an election ""will change nothing"" and it will ""threaten the continuity of the devolved institutions"".brokenshire convened crisis talks at stormont with the political parties. mcguinness led talks on behalf of sinn féin but, in a statement after the meeting, flanagan said that he believed the secretary of state (brokenshire) would have ""no choice but to call an election"".


=== political reaction to mcguinness' resignation ===


==== democratic unionist party (dup) ====
shortly after mcguinness resigned, foster called his actions ""non-principled"" and ""purely political"". in his resignation, mcguinness said that there would ""be no return to the status quo"". foster said that she was ""disappointed that martin mcguinness has chosen to take the position he has today"". she said that, due to his actions, ""we will have no government and no way to resolve the rhi problems"". she said that what annoys sinn féin ""the most"" was that the dup will ""always stand up for unionism and stand up for what is best in northern ireland"".
foster said that calls for her resignation are purely ""misogynistic"". after the resignation, she also called for a public inquiry to be held under the inquiries act 2005. she said that, if the election did happen, it would be a ""brutal election"" and said that northern ireland would be ""in for a period of direct rule"". she said that an inquiry could happen without the approval of sinn féin, who pressured foster to step aside due to her ""conflict of interest"". she said an inquiry, for her, would be ""vitally important from a political perspective but also fundamental for me on a personal basis"".sinn féin's finance minister máirtín ó muilleoir said foster's plan for an inquiry was not credible and ""it would be a laughing stock if we now had an inquiry that was set up at her behest"".


==== opposition parties ====
the sdlp's leader colum eastwood welcomed the resignation of mcguinness and said that the dup governed ""disgracefully and it has extended well beyond the leadership of arlene foster"". the sdlp said that sinn féin were ""jointly responsible"" and that the public ""also understand that there is one reason for this potential election – arlene foster's arrogance"".in response to foster's threat of direct rule returning to the province, the sdlp leader called for ""joint london and dublin rule"" if attempts to establish devolution fail. he said there could be ""no return to direct rule with london-based ministers in charge of the region"".the uup's leader mike nesbitt said that mcguinness' resignation ""let the dup off the hook"". he said that resigning ""was not the way to resolve the rhi scandal"". nesbitt said that there was an onus on claire sugden, the independent justice minister, to call a public inquiry and it is ""farcical"" to move ""straight to an election"" without having the ""facts of the rhi debacle exposed"".alliance's naomi long said that dup arrogance ""recklessly endangered"" the political institutions. she also said that foster's ""inability to swallow pride"" and her ""belligerent attitude"" placed the dup on a collision course with sinn féin. she called on foster to step aside so that sinn féin can re-nominate a deputy first minister before the 7-day period runs out. she said that ""the public have a right to expect better"".


=== possible impact on brexit ===
during the weekly prime minister's questions in the house of commons, angus robertson of the scottish national party (snp) questioned whether the brexit process would be delayed by the political crisis in northern ireland. according to the timetable for brexit, article 50 would be triggered by the end of march. robertson asked may whether she would delay brexit so that the northern irish government could be consulted as she ""pledged to consult with devolved administrations"".may responded to the snp's question by stating ""we can find a resolution to the political situation in northern ireland"" and that ""it is still the case that ministers are in place, and that obviously there are executives in place, and we are able to take the views of the northern ireland"".


=== líofa bursary controversy ===
on 23 december 2016, the dup minister for communities paul givan removed £50,000 of funding from the líofa gaeltacht bursary scheme. the money funded annual trips for 100 young people in northern ireland to the donegal gaeltacht where they could attend irish language classes. mcguinness said the dup's decision to remove funding from the líofa budget was another factor for his resignation.gerry adams called givan an ""ignoramus"" and called the decision ""ignorant"". givan came under pressure to reinstate the funding and he said that the original decision to cut the funding was ""not political"". his decision spurred protests outside the headquarters of the department for communities in belfast. as the protests were happening, givan tweeted that he reinstated the funding after he ""found the necessary funding"". furthermore, he said he ""was not prepared to allow sinn féin to use that £50,000 as a political weapon against us [the dup] in the upcoming election as tool to rally their troops, and so i've taken that away from them"". givan's decision was welcomed by irish language groups, but they insisted on an irish language act to be a feature of any crisis talks.


== collapse of stormont ==

on 16 january 2017, a plenary session of the northern ireland assembly was held to re-nominate a deputy first minister. sinn féin's health minister michelle o'neill said before the assembly session that ""we are not interested in trying to get into negotiations now – what we need is fundamental change. we believe the public need to have their say.""the speaker called on the dup and sinn féin to nominate a first minister and deputy first minister. lord morrow nominated foster again for first minister, a nomination which she accepted. sinn féin's nominating officer for the order of business was o'neill, who refused to nominate a deputy first minister. as the vacancies for the office were not filled after 7 days, the northern ireland executive collapsed at 5pm on 16 january 2017.
responsibility and power for northern ireland transferred to james brokenshire in his capacity as secretary of state for northern ireland on 16 january 2017. brokenshire made an announcement after the 7 day deadline passed and officially called a snap election for 2 march 2017. the northern ireland assembly was dissolved on 26 january 2017.


=== reaction ===
after brokenshire's announcement, british prime minister theresa may and irish taoiseach enda kenny discussed the situation by telephone.  the prime minister and the taoiseach ""repeated their desire to see the institutions established under the good friday agreement operating effectively"" and also ""expressed hope that the election campaign would be respectful"".
the us government called on all political parties to ""find a way forward"" to the resumption of ""stable devolved governance"".after the election was called, foster said the electorate did not ""want, or need an election"". she also said that ""they have forced an election that risks northern ireland's future and stability and which suits nobody but themselves"".sinn féin's michelle o'neill said that if sinn féin is to return to the chamber, ""there must be real, meaningful change"". she said that sinn féin ""strived"" to make the institutions work.


=== public inquiry ===
a motion was brought before the assembly on 17 january 2017 which called for a public inquiry to be set up under the inquiries act 2005 to investigate the rhi scheme in its entirety. the call for an inquiry was unanimous, but sinn féin mlas were not present for the debate. mlas do not have the power to set up an inquiry, but the motion calls on brokenshire as secretary of state to set up a public inquiry.
the police service of northern ireland (psni) confirmed that it is considering a request for the chief constable to investigate allegations of fraud in the rhi scheme.


=== allegations of dup family links to the scheme ===
jonathan bell, the previous deti minister, revealed in the assembly on 16 january 2017 under assembly privilege that timothy johnston and john robinson, two dup special advisers, had extensive interests in the poultry industry which is why he could not reduce the rhi tariff.following bell's allegations, the dup released a statement and denied his claims. robinson said he had ""no personal interest"" in the poultry industry, although two of his brothers are poultry farmers but were not involved in rhi. johnston said he had ""no family connection to the poultry industry"", although he had two brothers in law in the poultry industry, with neither having a connection to the rhi scheme.on 17 january 2017, robinson told the press association that his father-in-law applied to the scheme in august 2015, one day after he denied having any family connections. his father-in-law runs two boilers under the scheme. he denies having been involved with the rhi scheme prior to his appointment as special adviser to minister for the economy simon hamilton. he also said that ""at no point"" had he ""ever advised anyone to join the scheme or sought to benefit in any way from it"".bell also claimed one dup adviser may have ""up to eight boilers"", which the party called ""an outrageous claim"". bell said he was prepared to repeat his allegation before a judge-led inquiry.


=== public accounts committee hearing ===
on 18 january 2017, andrew mccormick was called before stormont's public accounts committee (pac). mccormick is a senior civil servant and serves as the permanent secretary to the department for the economy (dfe). during the committee hearing, he was questioned by mlas on the rhi scheme.
mccormick said he believes that a dup special adviser ""exerted influence"" on the scheme. he named the dup special adviser in question as andrew crawford, who was also accused by former minister bell as pressuring him to keep the scheme open.at the inception of the rhi scheme, crawford served as a special adviser to foster when she was deti minister. after foster left deti and joined the department of finance, he continued to serve as her adviser. it was also revealed that crawford's brother, who is a poultry farmer, benefits from the rhi scheme. in a statement, andrew crawford denied exerting pressure to keep the scheme open.mccormick also revealed that dfe contacted the rhi applicants to ask them to consent to their identities being released to the public. 90% of 1,400 people objected to this request. the list of applicants for the rhi scheme was later released by dfe, albeit individuals and not companies were withheld from the public domain.


=== 2017 assembly snap election ===

the northern ireland assembly election was held on 2 march 2017 across northern ireland. the election was the first election to feature a reduction in seats from 108 to 90 mlas. the dup and the uup both suffered electoral losses as the dup returned with 28 mlas and the uup with 10 mlas, down from 38 and 16 respectively. sinn féin returned 27 mlas and the sdlp returned 12 mlas. alliance maintained their 8 mlas. the election was the first election in the history of northern ireland that unionism lost its majority. the 2017 election witnessed a 9.8% increase in turnout throughout northern ireland as it stood at 64.78%.
by law, a government should have been set up by 27 march 2017 following the election or else the secretary of state for northern ireland is obliged to call another election within a ""reasonable period of time"". the then-secretary of state for northern ireland james brokenshire extended the talks deadline by early may, threatening direct rule if the parties did not form a government. day-to-day running of northern ireland has been left in the hands of the northern ireland civil service and the top civil servant, david sterling, is responsible for managing northern ireland's money.
the talks deadline was extended again until 29 june 2017 owing to prime minister theresa may's decision to call a snap general election. the 29 june deadline passed and brokenshire extended the deadline once again. the uk parliament was forced to pass a budget for the ongoing financial year 2017-18 which would then release the final 5% of northern ireland's block grant. talks again started in february 2018 but collapsed days before the mid-february deadline. pm theresa may and taoiseach leo varadkar attended the talks, but they collapsed again although sinn féin claimed that they had reached a deal with the dup. the uk parliament passed another budget for the financial year 2018–19 in response.


== public inquiry ==
on 19 january 2017, finance minister máirtín ó muilleoir established a public inquiry into the rhi scheme. the public inquiry is being chaired by sir patrick coghlin, a retired member of the court of appeal of northern ireland.
in march 2018, david sterling, who served as permanent secretary of deti at the time of the scheme's implementation, claimed that civil servants ""broke their own rules to acquiesce in the dup and sinn féin's desire for secrecy"". sterling, who is currently running northern ireland as its top civil servant, claimed that the dup and sinn féin wanted to thwart freedom of information requests and meetings were not minuted so information could not be made available to the public through these requests. sterling also said that ""there was a belief among senior civil servants and politicians that northern ireland should get as much money from the treasury as possible"".arlene foster's special adviser andrew crawford was called to give evidence to the public inquiry. he said he believed that all meetings were minuted and if meetings weren't minuted, it ""had not been at the request of the minister"". sir patrick, the inquiry head, said the only person who seemed to be ""unaware"" that notes had not been produced was crawford. crawford said it was an ""innuendo"" that no notes were taken of meetings.foster was called to give evidence to the inquiry in april 2018. she denied personal responsibility for the scheme and said it was ""a matter of deep regret"". foster said that she had ""allowed herself to be led by officials and by evidence as to what was the best way forward"". the inquiry also heard that she effectively wrote a ""blank cheque"" for the scheme without knowing its full cost.

quinestrol,reagent,"quinestrol, also known as ethinylestradiol cyclopentyl ether (eecpe), sold under the brand name estrovis among others, is an estrogen medication which has been used in menopausal hormone therapy, hormonal birth control, and to treat breast cancer and prostate cancer. it is taken once per week to once per month by mouth.


== medical uses ==
quinestrol has been used as the estrogen component in menopausal hormone therapy and in combined hormonal birth control. it has also occasionally been used in the treatment of breast cancer and prostate cancer, as well as to suppress lactation. on its own as an estrogen, quinestrol was taken once per week by mouth. as a combined birth control pill, it was used together with quingestanol acetate and was taken once per month by mouth.


== pharmacology ==

quinestrol is a prodrug of ethinylestradiol (ee), with no estrogenic activity of its own. it is taken orally and has prolonged activity following a single dose, with a very long biological half-life of more than 120 hours (5 days) due to enhanced lipophilicity and storage in fat. because of its much longer half-life, quinestrol is two to three times as potent as ee. also because of its long half-life, quinestrol can be taken once a week or once a month.following administration, quinestrol is absorbed via the lymphatic system, is stored in adipose tissue, and is gradually released from adipose tissue.


== chemistry ==

quinestrol, also known as ethinylestradiol 3-cyclopentyl ether (ee2cpe), is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of estradiol. it is an estrogen ether, specifically the c3 cyclopentyl ether of ethinylestradiol (17α-ethynylestradiol). closely related estrogens include mestranol (ethinylestradiol 3-methyl ether) and ethinylestradiol sulfonate (ees; turisteron; ethinylestradiol 3-isopropylsulfonate).


== history ==
quinestrol was developed and introduced for medical use in the 1960s.


== society and culture ==


=== generic names ===
quinestrol is the generic name of the drug and its inn, usan, and ban. it is also known by its former developmental code name w-3566.


=== brand names ===
quinestrol has been marketed under brand names including agalacto-quilea, basaquines, eston, estrovis, estrovister, plestrovis, qui-lea, soluna, and yueketing, among others.


=== availability ===
quinestrol was marketed as estrovis in the united states by parke-davis and as qui-lea in argentina, but is reportedly not currently marketed. however, it does appear to still be available as an oral contraceptive in combination with progestins in argentina and china.one tablet form available in china consists of 6 mg levonorgestrel and 3 mg quinestrol; it is used as a prescription ""long-term"" oral contraceptive, with one dose taken each month. it is sold under various brand names including yuèkětíng (chinese: 悦可婷) and àiyuè (chinese: 艾悦). a version with the racemic norgestrel in place of levonorgestrel also appears to be available.


== veterinary use ==


=== rodents ===
the chinese levonorgestrel/quinestrol 2:1 formula is known as ep-1 in veterinary practice. it is known to have some organ-specific effects on the mongolian gerbil as measured by receptor mrna expression. incorporated into baits at a concentration of 50 ppm, ep-1 has been used to control wild mongolian gerbil populations with some success.

sperm-specific class p protein 9/11 (worm),protein,"caenorhabditis elegans () is a free-living transparent nematode about 1 mm in length that lives in temperate soil environments. it is the type species of its genus. the name is a blend of the greek caeno- (recent), rhabditis (rod-like) and latin elegans (elegant). in 1900, maupas initially named it rhabditides elegans. osche placed it in the subgenus caenorhabditis in 1952, and in 1955, dougherty raised caenorhabditis to the status of genus.c. elegans is an unsegmented pseudocoelomate and lacks respiratory or circulatory systems. most of these nematodes are hermaphrodites and a few are males. males have specialised tails for mating that include spicules.
in 1963, sydney brenner proposed research into c. elegans, primarily in the area of neuronal development. in 1974, he began research into the molecular and developmental biology of c. elegans, which has since been extensively used as a model organism.  it was the first multicellular organism to have its whole genome sequenced, and as of 2019, is the only organism to have its connectome (neuronal ""wiring diagram"") completed.


== anatomy ==

c. elegans is unsegmented, vermiform, and bilaterally symmetrical. it has a cuticle (a tough outer covering, as an exoskeleton), four main epidermal cords, and a fluid-filled pseudocoelom (body cavity). it also has some of the same organ systems as larger animals. about one in a thousand individuals is male and the rest are hermaphrodites. the basic anatomy of c. elegans includes a mouth, pharynx, intestine, gonad, and collagenous cuticle.  like all nematodes, they have neither a circulatory nor a respiratory system. the four bands of muscles that run the length of the body are connected to a neural system that allows the muscles to move the animal's body only as dorsal bending or ventral bending, but not left or right, except for the head, where the four muscle quadrants are wired independently from one another.  when a wave of dorsal/ventral muscle contractions proceeds from the back to the front of the animal, the animal is propelled backwards. when a wave of contractions is initiated at the front and proceeds posteriorly along the body, the animal is propelled forwards. because of this dorsal/ventral bias in body bends, any normal living, moving individual tends to lie on either its left side or its right side when observed crossing a horizontal surface. a set of ridges on the lateral sides of the body cuticle, the alae, is believed to give the animal added traction during these bending motions.
in relation to lipid metabolism, c. elegans does not have any specialized adipose tissues, a pancreas, a liver, or even blood to deliver nutrients compared to mammals. neutral lipids are instead stored in the intestine, epidermis, and embryos. the epidermis corresponds to the mammalian adipocytes by being the main triglyceride depot.the pharynx is a muscular food pump in the head of c. elegans, which is triangular in cross-section. this grinds food and transports it directly to the intestine. a set of ""valve cells"" connects the pharynx to the intestine, but how this valve operates is not understood. after digestion, the contents of the intestine are released via the rectum, as is the case with all other nematodes. no direct connection exists between the pharynx and the excretory canal, which functions in the release of liquid urine.
males have a single-lobed gonad, a vas deferens, and a tail specialized for mating, which incorporates spicules. hermaphrodites have two ovaries, oviducts, and spermatheca, and a single uterus. 

c. elegans neurons contain dendrites which extend from the cell to receive neurotransmitters, and a process that extends to the nerve ring (the ""brain"") for a synaptic connection between neurons. the biggest difference is that c. elegans has motor excitatory and inhibitory neurons, known as cholinergic and gabaergic neurons, which simply act as further regulation for the tiny creature. they have no influence on the nervous system besides regulating neuron impulses.


=== gut granules ===
numerous gut granules are present in the intestine of c. elegans, the functions of which are still not fully known, as are many other aspects of this nematode, despite the many years that it has been studied. these gut granules are found in all of the rhabditida orders. they are very similar to lysosomes in that they feature an acidic interior and the capacity for endocytosis, but they are considerably larger, reinforcing the view of their being storage organelles.
a remarkable feature of the granules is that when they are observed under ultraviolet light, they react by emitting an intense blue fluorescence. another phenomenon seen is termed 'death fluorescence'. as the worms die, a dramatic burst of blue fluorescence is emitted. this death fluorescence typically takes place in an anterior to posterior wave that moves along the intestine, and is seen in both young and old worms, whether subjected to lethal injury or peacefully dying of old age.
many theories have been posited on the functions of the gut granules, with earlier ones being eliminated by later findings. they are thought to store zinc as one of their functions. recent chemical analysis has identified the blue fluorescent material they contain as a glycosylated form of anthranilic acid (aa). the need for the large amounts of aa the many gut granules contain is questioned. one possibility is that the aa is antibacterial and used in defense against invading pathogens. another possibility is that the granules provide photoprotection; the bursts of aa fluorescence entail the conversion of damaging uv light to relatively harmless visible light. this is seen a possible link to the melanin–containing melanosomes.


== reproduction ==
the hermaphroditic worm is considered to be a specialized form of self-fertile female, as its soma is female. the hermaphroditic germline produces male gametes first, and lays eggs through its uterus after internal fertilization. hermaphrodites produce all their sperm in the l4 stage (150 sperm cells per gonadal arm) and then produce only oocytes. the hermaphroditic gonad acts as an ovotestis with sperm cells being stored in the same area of the gonad as the oocytes until the first oocyte pushes the sperm into the spermatheca (a chamber wherein the oocytes become fertilized by the sperm).the male can inseminate the hermaphrodite, which will preferentially use male sperm (both types of sperm are stored in the spermatheca). 

 the sperm of c. elegans is amoeboid, lacking flagella and acrosomes. when self-inseminated, the wild-type worm lays about 300 eggs. when inseminated by a male, the number of progeny can exceed 1,000. hermaphrodites do not typically mate with other hermaphrodites. at 20 °c, the laboratory strain of c. elegans (n2) has an average lifespan around 2–3 weeks and a generation time of 3 to 4 days.
c. elegans has five pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. sex in c. elegans is based on an x0 sex-determination system. hermaphrodites of c. elegans have a matched pair of sex chromosomes (xx); the rare males have only one sex chromosome (x0).


== development ==


=== embryonic development ===
the fertilized zygote undergoes rotational holoblastic cleavage.
sperm entry into the oocyte commences formation of an anterior-posterior axis. the sperm microtubule organizing center directs the movement of the sperm pronucleus to the future posterior pole of the embryo, while also inciting the movement of par proteins, a group of cytoplasmic determination factors, to their proper respective locations. as a result of the difference in par protein distribution, the first cell division is highly asymmetric. c. elegans embryogenesis is among the best understood examples of asymmetric cell division.all cells of the germline arise from a single primordial germ cell, called the p4 cell, established early in embryogenesis. this primordial cell divides to generate two germline precursors that do not divide further until after hatching.


==== axis formation ====
the resulting daughter cells of the first cell division are called the ab cell (containing par-6 and par-3) and the p1 cell (containing par-1 and par-2). a second cell division produces the abp and aba cells from the ab cell, and the ems and p2 cells from the p1 cell. this division establishes the dorsal-ventral axis, with the abp cell forming the dorsal side and the ems cell marking the ventral side.  through wnt signaling, the p2 cell instructs the ems cell to divide along the anterior-posterior axis. through notch signaling, the p2 cell differentially specifies the abp and aba cells, which further defines the dorsal-ventral axis. the left-right axis also becomes apparent early in embryogenesis, although it is unclear exactly when specifically the axis is determined. however, most theories of the l-r axis development involve some kind of differences in cells derived from the ab cell.


==== gastrulation ====
gastrulation occurs after the embryo reaches the 24-cell stage. c. elegans are a species of protostomes, so the blastopore eventually forms the mouth. involution into the blastopore begins with movement of the endoderm cells and subsequent formation of the gut, followed by the p4 germline precursor, and finally the mesoderm cells, including the cells that eventually form the pharynx. gastrulation ends when epiboly of the hypoblasts closes the blastopore.


=== post-embryonic development ===
under environmental conditions favourable for reproduction, hatched larvae develop through four larval stages - l1, l2, l3, and l4 - in just 3 days at 20 °c. when conditions are stressed, as in food insufficiency, excessive population density or high temperature, c. elegans can enter an alternative third larval stage, l2d, called the dauer stage (dauer is german for permanent). a specific dauer pheromone regulates entry into the dauer state. this pheromone is composed of similar derivatives of the 3,6-dideoxy sugar, ascarylose. ascarosides, named after the ascarylose base, are involved in many sex-specific and social behaviors. in this way, they constitute a chemical language that c. elegans uses to modulate various phenotypes. dauer larvae are stress-resistant; they are thin and their mouths are sealed with a characteristic dauer cuticle and cannot take in food. they can remain in this stage for a few months. the stage ends when conditions improve favour further growth of the larva, now moulting into the l4 stage, even though the gonad development is arrested at the l2 stage.each stage transition is punctuated by a molt of the worm's transparent cuticle. transitions through these stages are controlled by genes of the heterochronic pathway, an evolutionarily conserved set of regulatory factors. many heterochronic genes code for micrornas, which repress the expression of heterochronic transcription factors and other heterochronic mirnas. mirnas were originally discovered in c. elegans. important developmental events controlled by heterochronic genes include the division and eventual syncitial fusion of the hypodermic seam cells, and their subsequent secretion of the alae in young adults. it is believed that the heterochronic pathway represents an evolutionarily conserved predecessor to circadian clocks.nematodes have a fixed, genetically determined number of cells, a phenomenon known as eutely. the adult c. elegans hermaphrodite has 959 somatic cells and the male has 1033 cells, although it has been suggested that the number of their intestinal cells can increase by one to three in response to gut microbes experienced by mothers. much of the literature describes the cell number in males as 1031, but the discovery of a pair of left and right mcm neurons increased the number by two in 2015. the number of cells does not change after cell division ceases at the end of the larval period, and subsequent growth is due solely to an increase in the size of individual cells.


== ecology ==

the different caenorhabditis species occupy various nutrient- and bacteria-rich environments. they feed on the bacteria that develop in decaying organic matter (microbivory). soil lacks enough organic matter to support self-sustaining populations. c. elegans can survive on a diet of a variety of bacteria, but its wild ecology is largely unknown. most laboratory strains were taken from artificial environments such as gardens and compost piles. more recently, c. elegans has been found to thrive in other kinds of organic matter, particularly rotting fruit.c. elegans can also use different species of yeast, including cryptococcus laurentii and cryptococcus kuetzingii, as sole source of food. although a bacterivore, c. elegans can be killed by a number of pathogenic bacteria, including human pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica or enterococcus faecalis.invertebrates such as millipedes, insects, isopods, and gastropods can transport dauer larvae to various suitable locations. the larvae have also been seen to feed on their hosts when they die.nematodes can survive desiccation, and in c. elegans, the mechanism for this capability has been demonstrated to be late embryogenesis abundant proteins.c. elegans, as other nematodes, can be eaten by predator nematodes and other omnivores, including some insects.the orsay virus is a virus that affects c. elegans, as well as the caenorhabditis elegans cer1 virus and the caenorhabditis elegans cer13 virus.

interactions with fungiwild isolates of caenorhabditis elegans are regularly found with infections by microsporidia fungi. one such species, nematocida parisii, replicates in the intestines of c. elegans.arthrobotrys oligospora is the model organism for interactions between fungi and nematodes. it is the most common nematode capturing fungus, and most widespread nematode trapping fungus in nature.


== research use ==

in 1963, sydney brenner proposed using c. elegans as a model organism for the investigation primarily of neural development in animals. it is one of the simplest organisms with a nervous system. the neurons do not fire action potentials, and do not express any voltage-gated sodium channels. in the hermaphrodite, this system comprises 302 neurons the pattern of which has been comprehensively mapped, in what is known as a connectome, and shown to be a small-world network.research has explored the neural and molecular mechanisms that control several behaviors of c. elegans, including chemotaxis, thermotaxis, mechanotransduction, learning, memory, and mating behaviour. in 2019 the connectome of the male was published using a technique distinct from that used for the hermaphrodite. the same paper used the new technique to redo the hermaphrodite connectome, finding 1,500 new synapses.it has been used as a model organism to study molecular mechanisms in metabolic diseases. 
brenner also chose it as it is easy to grow in bulk populations, and convenient for genetic analysis. it is a multicellular eukaryotic organism, yet simple enough to be studied in great detail. the transparency of c. elegans facilitates the study of cellular differentiation and other developmental processes in the intact organism. the spicules in the male clearly distinguish males from females. strains are cheap to breed and can be frozen. when subsequently thawed, they remain viable, allowing long-term storage. maintenance is easy when compared to other multicellular model organisms. a few hundred nematodes can be kept on a single agar plate and suitable growth medium. brenner described the use of a mutant of e. coli – op50. op50 is a uracil-requiring organism and its deficiency in the plate prevents the overgrowth of bacteria which would obscure the worms. the use of op50 does not demand any major laboratory safety measures, since it is non-pathogenic and easily grown in luria-bertani (lb) media overnight.


=== notable findings ===
the developmental fate of every single somatic cell (959 in the adult hermaphrodite; 1031 in the adult male) has been mapped. these patterns of cell lineage are largely invariant between individuals, whereas in mammals, cell development is more dependent on cellular cues from the embryo.
as mentioned previously, the first cell divisions of early embryogenesis in c. elegans are among the best understood examples of asymmetric cell divisions, and the worm is a very popular model system for studying developmental biology.programmed cell death (apoptosis) eliminates many additional cells (131 in the hermaphrodite, most of which would otherwise become neurons); this ""apoptotic predictability"" has contributed to the elucidation of some apoptotic genes. cell death-promoting genes and a single cell-death inhibitor have been identified.

rna interference (rnai) is a relatively straightforward method of disrupting the function of specific genes. silencing the function of a gene can sometimes allow a researcher to infer its possible function. the nematode can be soaked in, injected with, or fed with genetically transformed bacteria that express the double-stranded rna of interest, the sequence of which complements the sequence of the gene that the researcher wishes to disable.
rnai has emerged as a powerful tool in the study of functional genomics. c. elegans has been used to analyse gene functions and claim the promise of future findings in the systematic genetic interactions.environmental rnai uptake is much worse in other species of worms in the genus caenorhabditis. although injecting rna into the body cavity of the animal induces gene silencing in most species, only c. elegans and a few other distantly related nematodes can take up rna from the bacteria they eat for rnai. this ability has been mapped down to a single gene, sid-2, which, when inserted as a transgene in other species, allows them to take up rna for rnai as c. elegans does.research into meiosis has been considerably simplified since every germ cell nucleus is at the same given position as it moves down the gonad, so is at the same stage in meiosis. in an early phase of meiosis, the oocytes become extremely resistant to radiation and this resistance depends on expression of genes rad51 and atm that have key roles in recombinational repair. gene mre-11 also plays a crucial role in recombinational repair of dna damage during meiosis. a study of the frequency of outcrossing in natural populations showed that selfing is the predominant mode of reproduction in c. elegans, but that infrequent outcrossing events occur at a rate around 1%.   meioses that result in selfing are unlikely to contribute significantly to beneficial genetic variability, but these meioses may provide the adaptive benefit of recombinational repair of dna damages that arise, especially under stressful conditions.nicotine dependence can also be studied using c. elegans because it exhibits behavioral responses to nicotine that parallel those of mammals. these responses include acute response, tolerance, withdrawal, and sensitization.as for most model organisms, scientists that work in the field curate a dedicated online database and the wormbase is that for c. elegans. the wormbase attempts to collate all published information on c. elegans and other related nematodes. their website has advertised a reward of $4000 for the finder of a new species of closely related nematode. such a discovery would broaden research opportunities with the worm.c. elegans has been a model organism for research into ageing; for example, the inhibition of an insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway has been shown to increase adult lifespan threefold; while glucose feeding promotes oxidative stress and reduce adult lifespan by a half. in addition c. elegans exposed to 5mm lithium chloride (licl) showed lengthened life spans. when exposed to 10μm licl, reduced mortality was observed, but not with 1μm.c. elegans has been instrumental in the identification of the functions of genes implicated in alzheimer's disease, such as presenilin. moreover, extensive research on c. elegans has identified rna-binding proteins as essential factors during germline and early embryonic development.c. elegans is notable in animal sleep studies as the most primitive organism to display sleep-like states. in c. elegans, a lethargus phase occurs shortly before each moult. c. elegans has also been demonstrated to sleep after exposure to physical stress, including heat shock, uv radiation, and bacterial toxins.while the worm has no eyes, it has been found to be sensitive to light due to a third type of light-sensitive animal photoreceptor protein, lite-1, which is 10 to 100 times more efficient at absorbing light than the other two types of photopigments (opsins and cryptochromes) found in the animal kingdom.c. elegans is remarkably adept at tolerating acceleration. it can withstand 400,000 g's, according to geneticists at the university of são paulo in brazil. in an experiment, 96% of them were still alive without adverse effects after an hour in an ultracentrifuge.


=== spaceflight research ===
c. elegans made news when specimens were discovered to have survived the space shuttle columbia disaster in february 2003. later, in january 2009, live samples of c. elegans from the university of nottingham were announced to be spending two weeks on the international space station that october, in a space research project to explore the effects of zero gravity on muscle development and physiology. the research was primarily about genetic basis of muscle atrophy, which relates to spaceflight or being bed-ridden, geriatric, or diabetic. descendants of the worms aboard columbia in 2003 were launched into space on endeavour for the sts-134 mission. additional experiments on muscle dystrophy during spaceflight will be carried on board of the iss starting in december 2018.


== genetics ==


=== genome ===

c. elegans was the first multicellular organism to have its whole genome sequenced. the sequence was published in 1998, although some small gaps were present; the last gap was finished by october 2002.


==== size and gene content ====
the c. elegans genome is about 100 million base pairs long and consists of six pairs of chromosomes in hermaphrodites or five pairs of autosomes with xo chromosome in male c.elegans and a mitochondrial genome. its gene density is about one gene per five kilo-base pairs. introns make up 26% and intergenic regions 47% of the genome. many genes are arranged in clusters and how many of these are operons is unclear. c. elegans and other nematodes are among the few eukaryotes currently known to have operons; these include trypanosomes, flatworms (notably the trematode schistosoma mansoni), and a primitive chordate tunicate oikopleura dioica. many more organisms are likely to be shown to have these operons.the genome contains an estimated 20,470 protein-coding genes. about 35% of c. elegans genes have human homologs. remarkably, human genes have been shown repeatedly to replace their c. elegans homologs when introduced into c. elegans. conversely, many c. elegans genes can function similarly to mammalian genes.the number of known rna genes in the genome has increased greatly due to the 2006 discovery of a new class called 21u-rna genes, and the genome is now believed to contain more than 16,000 rna genes, up from as few as 1,300 in 2005.scientific curators continue to appraise the set of known genes; new gene models continue to be added and incorrect ones modified or removed.
the reference c. elegans genome sequence continues to change as new evidence reveals errors in the original sequencing. most changes are minor, adding or removing only a few base pairs of dna. for example, the ws202 release of wormbase (april 2009) added two base pairs to the genome sequence. sometimes, more extensive changes are made as noted in the ws197 release of december 2008, which added a region of over 4,300 bp to the sequence.


==== related genomes ====
in 2003, the genome sequence of the related nematode c. briggsae was also determined, allowing researchers to study the comparative genomics of these two organisms. the genome sequences of more nematodes from the same genus e.g., c. remanei, c. japonica and c. brenneri (named after brenner), have also been studied using the shotgun sequencing technique. these sequences have now been completed.


=== other genetic studies ===

as of 2014, c. elegans is the most basal species in the 'elegans' group (10 species) of the 'elegans' supergroup (17 species)  in phylogenetic studies. it forms a branch of its own distinct to any other species of the group.tc1 transposon is a dna transposon active in c. elegans.


== scientific community ==
in 2002, the nobel prize in physiology or medicine was awarded to sydney brenner, h. robert horvitz, and john sulston for their work on the genetics of organ development and programmed cell death in c. elegans. the 2006 nobel prize in physiology or medicine was awarded to andrew fire and craig c. mello for their discovery of rna interference in c. elegans. in 2008, martin chalfie shared a nobel prize in chemistry for his work on green fluorescent protein; some of the research involved the use of c. elegans.
many scientists who research c. elegans closely connect to sydney brenner, with whom almost all research in this field began in the 1970s; they have worked as either a postdoctoral or a postgraduate researcher in brenner's lab or in the lab of someone who previously worked with brenner. most who worked in his lab later established their own worm research labs, thereby creating a fairly well-documented ""lineage"" of c. elegans scientists, which was recorded into the wormbase database in some detail at the 2003 international worm meeting.

ksnapshot,non_science,"ksnapshot is a screenshot application for the kde desktop environment developed by richard j. moore, matthias ettrich and aaron j. seigo. the screenshots taken by ksnapshot are also called snapshots, which explains its name. it is written in qt and c++. ksnapshot allows users to use hotkeys to take a screenshot.
in december 2015, ksnapshot has been replaced by spectacle.


== features ==
ksnapshot has the following features:
save snapshot in multiple formats
take new snapshot
open with... possibility to open snapshot in external editor.
copy to clipboard
several capture modes, including selected region or single window.
snapshot delayksnapshot also had a direct-to-print button but it was removed in version kde 3.5.


== spectacle ==

spectacle replaced ksnapshot with the release of kde applications 15.12 in december 2015.
in addition to what one could do with ksnapshot, spectacle can take composite screenshots of pop-up menus along with their parent windows. other feature is the ability to take screenshots without explicitly starting spectacle by using the keyboard shortcuts ⇧ shift+printscreen and meta+printscreen respectively. spectacle was optimized to start fast to minimize the time lag between starting the application and capturing the image.

linoleic acid,antibiotic,"linoleic acid is an organic compound with the formula cooh(ch2)7ch=chch2ch=ch(ch2)4ch3. both alkene groups are cis.  it is a fatty acid sometimes denoted 18:2 (n-6) or 18:2 cis-9,12.  a linoleate is a salt or ester of this acid.linoleic acid is a polyunsaturated omega-6 fatty acid. it is a colorless or white oil that is virtually insoluble in water but soluble in many organic solvents. it typically occurs in nature as a triglyceride (ester of glycerin) rather than as a free fatty acid. it is one of two essential fatty acids for humans, who must obtain it through their diet.the word ""linoleic"" derives from the latin linum ""flax"" + oleum ""oil"", reflecting the fact that it was first isolated from linseed oil.


== in physiology ==
the consumption of linoleic acid is vital to proper health, as it is an essential fatty acid. in rats, a diet deficient in linoleate (the salt form of the acid) has been shown to cause mild skin scaling, hair loss,
and poor wound healing.


=== metabolism and eicosanoids ===

linoleic acid is a precursor to arachidonic acid (aa) with elongation and saturation,.  aa is the precursor to some prostaglandins, leukotrienes (lta, ltb, ltc), and thromboxane (txa).the metabolism of la to aa begins with the conversion of la into gamma-linolenic acid (gla), effected by δ6desaturase. gla is converted to dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (dgla), the immediate precursor to aa. 
la is also converted by various lipoxygenases, cyclooxygenases, cytochrome p450 enzymes (the cyp monooxygenases), and non-enzymatic autoxidation mechanisms to mono-hydroxyl products viz., 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, and 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid; these two hydroxy metabolites are enzymatically oxidized to their keto metabolites, 13-oxo-octadecadienoic acid and 9-oxo-octadecdienoic acid.  certain cytochrome p450 enzymes, the cyp epoxygenases, catalyze oxidation of la to epoxide products viz., its 12,13-epoxide, vernolic acid, and its 9,10-epoxide, coronaric acid.  these linoleic acid products are implicated in human physiology and pathology.


== uses and reactions ==
linoleic acid is a component of quick-drying oils, which are useful in oil paints and varnishes. these applications exploit the lability of the doubly allylic c-h groups (-ch=ch-ch2-ch=ch-) toward oxygen in air (autoxidation).  addition of oxygen leads to crosslinking and formation of a stable film.reduction of the carboxylic acid group of linoleic acid yields linoleyl alcohol.linoleic acid is a surfactant with a critical micelle concentration of 1.5 x 10−4 m @ ph 7.5.linoleic acid has become increasingly popular in the beauty products industry because of its beneficial properties on the skin.  research points to linoleic acid's anti-inflammatory, acne reductive, skin-lightening and moisture retentive properties when applied topically on the skin.


== dietary sources ==
it is abundant in safflower, sunflower, corn, and comprises over half their composition by weight. it is present in medium quantities in soybean oils, sesame, and almonds.


=== other occurrences ===
cockroaches release oleic and linoleic acid upon death, which discourages other roaches from entering the area.  this is similar to the mechanism found in ants and bees, which release oleic acid upon death.


== history ==
in 1844, f. sacc, working at the laboratory of justus von liebig, isolated linoleic acid from linseed oil. in 1886, k. peters determined the existence of two double bonds. its essential role in human diet was discovered by g. o. burr and others in 1930. its chemical structure was determined by t.p. hilditch and others in 1939, and it was synthesized by r. a. raphael and f. sondheimer in 1950.

oscr#19(1-),reagent,"the scottish charity regulator (oscr) is a non-ministerial department of the scottish government with responsibility for the regulation of charities in scotland.
oscr is the independent regulator and registrar for more than 24,000 scottish charities. oscr is charged with developing a regulatory framework for scottish charities, where each charity is clear about is rights and responsibilities. this framework should also foster public confidence in charities. oscr is directly answerable to the scottish parliament. oscr is based in dundee.


== background ==
in 1981 the law society of scotland announced support for a register through which all charities in scotland could record their purposes, financial details and accounts. under section 6 of the law reform (miscellaneous provisions) (scotland) act 1990, the lord advocate was given the power to make enquiries either for general or specific purposes and to obtain various types of information from charities. following the scotland act and the establishment of both the scottish parliament and the scottish government this power was exercised by the scottish ministers.
initially charity regulation was carried out by the scottish charities office, a department in the crown office, but they were only able to investigate a charity on receipt of a complaint or when they had reasonable grounds to suspect problems. the regulatory function was transferred to oscr in december 2003.


== history ==
it was formerly an executive agency but following the passing of the charities and trustee investment (scotland) act 2005 it was made independent of ministerial control, and answers directly to the scottish parliament. it is the equivalent of the charity commission for england and wales and the charity commission for northern ireland.
in 2005, oscr published the first definitive list of 18,000 charities operating in scotland – this information was searchable.oscr's full regulatory powers came into force on 24 april 2006.in july 2008, oscr published results of a survey showing some positive attitudes towards the organisation from the charity sector and the public.


== functions ==
the oscr perform a range of functions which includes:
determining whether bodies are charities.
keeping a public register of charities.
facilitating compliance by charities with the legislation.
investigating any apparent misconduct in the administration of charities.
giving information or advice to scottish ministers.oscr also has a role to protect whistleblowers from detrimental treatment. under the public interest disclosure act 1998, oscr is a ""prescribed person"" and therefore allowed to accept disclosures from people who carry out paid work for a charity.

vomeronasal sensory neuron,cell,"the vomeronasal organ (vno), or jacobson's organ, is the paired auxiliary olfactory (smell) sense organ located in the soft tissue of the nasal septum, in the nasal cavity just above the roof of the mouth (the hard palate). the name is derived from the fact that it lies adjacent to the unpaired vomer bone (from latin vomer 'plowshare', for its shape) in the nasal septum. it is present and functional in all snakes and lizards, and in many mammals, including cats, dogs, cattle, pigs, and some primates; in humans and horses it is present, but is vestigial and non-functional. 
the vno contains the cell bodies of sensory neurons which have receptors that detect specific non-volatile (liquid) organic compounds which are conveyed to them from the environment. these compounds emanate from prey, predators, and the compounds called sex pheromones from potential mates. activation of the vno triggers an appropriate behavioral response to the presence of one of these three.
vno neurons are activated by the binding of certain chemicals to their g protein-coupled receptors: they express receptors from three families, called v1r, v2r, and fpr. the axons from these neurons, called cranial nerve zero (cn 0), project to the accessory olfactory bulb, which targets the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, which in turn project to the anterior hypothalamus. these structures constitute the accessory olfactory system.
the vno triggers the flehmen response in some mammals, which helps direct liquid organic chemicals to the organ. the vno was discovered by frederik ruysch prior to 1732, and later by ludwig jacobson in 1813.


== structure ==


=== the organ ===

the vno is found at the base of the nasal cavity. it is split into two, being divided by the nasal septum, with both sides possessing an elongated c-shaped, or crescent, lumen. it is encompassed inside a bony or cartilaginous capsule which opens into the base of the nasal cavity.


=== the system ===
the vomeronasal receptor neurons possess axons which travel from the vno to the accessory olfactory bulb (aob) or, as it's also known, the vomeronasal bulb. these sensory receptors are located on the medial concave surface of the crescent lumen. the lateral, convex surface of the lumen is covered with non-sensory ciliated cells, where the basal cells are also found. at the dorsal and ventral aspect of the lumen are vomeronasal glands, which fill the vomeronasal lumen with fluid. sitting next to the lumen are blood vessels that dilate or constrict, forming a vascular pump that deliver stimuli to the lumen. a thin duct, which opens onto the floor of the nasal cavity inside the nostril, is the only way of access for stimulus chemicals.
during embryological development, the vomeronasal sensory neurons form from the nasal (olfactory) placode, at the anterior edge of the neural plate (cranial nerve zero).


=== sensory epithelium and receptors ===
the vno is a tubular crescent shape and split into two pairs, separated by the nasal septum. the medial, concave area of the lumen is lined with a pseudo stratified epithelium that has three main cell types: receptor cells, supporting cells, and basal cells. the supporting cells are located superficially on the membrane while the basal cells are found on the basement membrane near the non-sensory epithelium. the receptor neurons possess apical microvilli, to which the sensory receptors are localized. these are g-protein-coupled receptors, which are often referred to as pheromone receptors since vomeronasal receptors have been tied to detecting pheromones.
three g-protein-coupled receptors have been identified in the vno, each found in distinct regions: the v1rs, v2rs, and fprs. v1rs, v2rs and fprs are seven transmembrane receptors which are not closely related to odorant receptors expressed in the main olfactory neuroepithelium.
v1 receptors, v1rs, are linked to the g protein, gαi2. the benefit of the gpcr is that they signal in more than one direction. v1rs are located on the apical compartment of the vno and a relatively short nh2 terminal and have a great sequence diversity in their transmembrane domains. v1r is specifically expressed in the rodent vomeronasal organ (vno) and is thought to be responsible for pheromone reception, eliciting a signal transduction.
v2 receptors, v2rs, are linked to the g-protein, gαo. these have long extracellular nh2 terminals which are thought to be the binding domain for pheromonal molecules and are located on the basal compartment of the vno. v2r genes can be grouped into four separate families, labelled a – d. family c v2rs are quite distinct from the other families, and they are expressed in most basal neurons of the vno.the vomeronasal organ's sensory neurons act on a different signaling pathway than that of the main olfactory system's sensory neurons. activation of the receptors stimulates phospholipase c, which in turn opens the ion channel trpc2. upon stimulation activated by pheromones, ip3 production has been shown to increase in vno membranes in many animals, while adenylyl cyclase and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp), the major signaling transduction molecules of the main olfactory system, remain unaltered. this trend has been shown in many animals, such as the hamster, the pig, the rat, and the garter snake upon introduction of vaginal or seminal secretions into the environment.
v1rs and v2rs are activated by distinct ligands or pheromones.  

gi proteins are activated upon stimulation with lipophilic odorants.
go proteins are activated by nonvolatile proteins, such as the major urinary proteins in mice and exocrine gland-secreting peptide 1 (esp1).many vomeronasal neurons are activated by chemicals in urine. some of the active compounds are sulfated steroids. detecting the types and amounts of different sulfated steroids conveys information about the urine donor's physiological state, and may therefore serve as an honest signal.
recent studies proved a new family of formyl peptide receptor like proteins in vno membranes of mice, which points to a close phylogenetic relation of signaling mechanisms used in olfaction and chemosensors.


=== sensory neurons ===
vomeronasal sensory neurons are extremely sensitive and fire action potentials at currents as low as 1 pa. many patch-clamp recordings have confirmed the sensitivity of the vomeronasal neurons. this sensitivity is tied to the fact that the resting potential of the vomeronasal neurons is relatively close to that of the firing threshold of these neurons. vomeronasal sensory neurons also show remarkably slow adaptation and the firing rate increases with increasing current up to 10 pa. the main olfactory sensory neurons fire single burst action potentials and show a much quicker adaptation rate. activating neurons that have v1 receptors, v1rs, cause field potentials that have weak, fluctuating responses that are seen the anterior of the accessory olfactory bulb, aob. activation of neurons that contain v2 receptors, v2rs, however, promote distinct oscillations in the posterior of the aob.


== function ==
in mammals, the sensory neurons of the vomeronasal organ detect non-volatile chemical cues, which requires direct physical contact with the source of odor. notably, some scents act as chemical-communication signals (pheromones) from other individuals of the same species. unlike the main olfactory bulb that sends neuronal signals to the olfactory cortex, the vno sends neuronal signals to the accessory olfactory bulb and then to the amygdala, bnst, and ultimately hypothalamus. since the hypothalamus is a major neuroendocrine center (affecting aspects of reproductive physiology and behavior as well as other functions such as body temperature), this may explain how scents influence aggressive and mating behavior. for example, in many vertebrates, nerve signals from the brain pass sensory information to the hypothalamus about seasonal changes and the availability of a mate. in turn, the hypothalamus regulates the release of reproductive hormones required for breeding. some pheromones are detected by the main olfactory system.


== animals which possess ==
the functional vomeronasal system is found in all snakes and lizards, and many mammals.

salamanders perform a nose-tapping behavior to presumably activate their vno.
snakes use this organ to sense prey, sticking their tongue out to gather scents and touching it to the opening of the organ when the tongue is retracted.
the organ is well developed in strepsirrhine primates such as lemurs and lorises, developed to varying degrees in new world monkeys, and underdeveloped in old world monkeys and apes.
elephants transfer chemosensory stimuli to the vomeronasal opening in the roof of their mouths using the prehensile structure, sometimes called a finger, at the tips of their trunks.
painted turtles use this organ to use their sense of smell underwater.
garter snakes – in addition to the main olfactory system, garter snakes also have the vomeronasal system which consists of the vomeronasal organ. the vomeronasal organ plays an important role in some vertebrates with its sensitivity toward chemicals that are related to mating or sensing prey. for example, the snakes use the organ to detect the presence of prey or predator by gathering the chemical cues in the environment through the flicking behavior of the forked tongue. moreover, garter snakes also uses the vomeronasal organ in their pheromone communication as well. particularly, there should be a distinction made between the odors and vomodors. odors are chemicals detected by the sensory cells in the nasal epithelium through the process of olfaction. vomodors are chemicals detected by the sensory cells from the vomeronasal organ through the process of vomerolfaction. upon entering the lumen of the organ, the chemical molecules will come into contact with the sensory cells which are attached to the neurosensory epithelium of the vomeronasal organ. more importantly, a new research has demonstrated that the vomeronasal organ is necessary in order for garter snake to respond to airborne prey odors, but fail to respond to airborne nonprey odors.in some other mammals the entire organ contracts or pumps in order to draw in the scents.


== flehmen response ==
some mammals, particularly felids (cats) and ungulates (which includes horses, cattle, and pigs among other species), use a distinctive facial movement called the flehmen response to direct inhaled compounds to the vno. the animal lifts its head after finding the odorant, wrinkles its nose while lifting its lips, and ceases to breathe momentarily.
flehmen behavior is associated with “anatomical specialization”, and animals that present flehmen behavior have incisive papilla and ducts, which connect the oral cavity to the vno, that are found behind their teeth. however, horses are the exception: they exhibit flehmen response but do not have an incisive duct communication between the nasal and the oral cavity because they do not breathe through their mouths; instead, the vnos connect to the nasal passages by the nasopalatine duct.cats use their vomeronasal organ when scent rubbing; they are able to discriminate between similar smelling substances using this organ, and then perform the rubbing behaviour.


== evidence for existence in humans ==
many studies have been performed to determine whether there is an actual presence of a vno in adult human beings. trotier et al. estimated that around 92% of their subjects that had no septal surgery had at least one intact vno. kjaer and fisher hansen, on the other hand, stated that vno structure disappeared during fetal development as it does for some primates. however, smith and bhatnagar (2000) asserted that kjaer and fisher hansen simply missed the structure in older fetuses. won (2000) found evidence of a vno in 13 of his 22 cadavers (59.1%) and in 22 of his 78 living patients (28.2%). in a study published in 2016, stoyanov et al. found the organ to be present in 26.83% of the bulgarian population, using retrospective analysis of nearly a thousand outpatient nasal endoscopies.given these findings, some scientists have argued that there is a vno in adult human beings. however, most investigators have sought to identify the opening of the vomeronasal organ in humans, rather than identify the tubular epithelial structure itself. thus it has been argued that such studies, employing macroscopic observational methods, have sometimes missed or even misidentified the vomeronasal organ.among studies that use microanatomical methods, there is no reported evidence that human beings have active sensory neurons like those in working vomeronasal systems of other animals. furthermore, there is no evidence to date that suggests there are nerve and axon connections between any existing sensory receptor cells that may be in the adult human vno and the brain. likewise, there is no evidence for any accessory olfactory bulb in adult human beings, and the key genes involved in vno function in other mammals have pseudogeneized in human beings. therefore, while the presence of a structure in adult human beings is debated, a review of the scientific literature by tristram wyatt concluded, ""most in the field... are skeptical about the likelihood of a functional vno in adult human beings on current evidence.""

biotin medicated shampoo,drug,"skin disorders are among the most common health problems in dogs, and have many causes. the condition of a dog's skin and coat are also an important indicator of its general health. skin disorders of dogs vary from acute, self-limiting problems to chronic or long-lasting problems requiring life-time treatment. skin disorders may be primary or secondary (due to scratching, itch) in nature, making diagnosis complicated.


== immune-mediated skin disorders ==
skin disease may result from deficiency or overactivity of immune responses. in cases where there are insufficient immune responses, the disease is usually described by the secondary disease that results. examples include increased susceptibility to demodectic mange and recurrent skin infections, such as malassezia infection or bacterial infections. increased but harmful immune responses can be divided into hypersensitivity disorders such as atopic dermatitis and autoimmune disorders (autoimmunity), such as pemphigus and discoid lupus erythematosus.


=== atopic dermatitis ===

atopy is a hereditary and chronic (lifelong) allergic skin disease. signs usually begin between 6 months and 3 years of age, with some breeds of dog, such as the golden retriever, showing signs at an earlier age. dogs with atopic dermatitis are itchy, especially around the eyes, muzzle, ears and feet. in severe cases, the irritation is generalised. if the allergens are seasonal, the signs of irritation are similarly seasonal. many dogs with house dust mite allergy have perennial disease. some of the allergens associated with atopy in dogs include pollens of trees, grasses and weeds, as well as molds and house dust mites. ear and skin infections by the bacteria staphylococcus pseudintermedius and the yeast malassezia pachydermatis are commonly secondary to atopic dermatitis.
food allergy can be associated with identical signs and some authorities consider food allergy to be a type of atopic dermatitis. food allergy can be identified through the use of elimination diet trials in which a novel or hydrolysed protein diet is used for a minimum of 6 weeks.
diagnosis of atopic dermatitis is by elimination of other causes of irritation, including fleas, mites, and other parasites, such as cheyletiella and lice. allergies to aeroallergens can be identified using intradermal allergy testing and/or blood testing (allergen-specific ige elisa).
treatment includes avoidance of the offending allergens if possible, but for most dogs this is not practical or effective. other treatments modulate the adverse immune response to allergens and include antihistamines, steroids, ciclosporin, and immunotherapy (a process in which allergens are injected to try to induce tolerance). in many cases, shampoos, medicated wipes and ear cleaners are needed to try to prevent the return of infections.


=== autoimmune skin diseases ===
pemphigus foliaceus is the most common autoimmune disease of the dog. blisters in the epidermis rapidly break to form crusts and erosions, most often affecting the face and ears initially, but in some cases spreading to include the whole body. the paw pads can be affected, causing marked hyperkeratosis (thickening of the pads with scale). other autoimmune diseases include bullous pemphigoid and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita.
treatment of autoimmune skin requires methods to reduce the abnormal immune response; steroids, azathioprine and other drugs are used as immunosuppressive agents.


== physical and environmental skin diseases ==


=== hot spots ===

a hot spot, or acute moist dermatitis, is an acutely inflamed and infected area of skin irritation created and made worse by a dog licking and biting at itself. a hot spot can manifest and spread rapidly in a matter of hours, as secondary staphylococcus infection causes the top layers of the skin to break down and pus becomes trapped in the hair. hot spots can be treated with corticosteroid medications and oral or topical antibiotic applications, as well as clipping hair from around the lesion. underlying causes include flea allergy dermatitis or other allergic skin diseases. dogs with thick undercoats are most susceptible to developing hot spots.


=== acral lick granulomas ===

lick granulomas are raised, usually ulcerated areas on a dog's extremity caused by the dog's own incessant, compulsive licking. compulsive licking is defined as licking in excess of that required for standard grooming or exploration, and represents a change in the animal's typical behavior and interferes with other activities or functions (e.g., eating, drinking, playing, interacting with people) and cannot easily be interrupted.


== infectious skin diseases ==

infectious skin diseases of dogs include contagious and non-contagious infections or infestations. contagious infections include parasitic, bacterial, fungal and viral skin diseases.
one of the most common contagious parasitic skin diseases is sarcoptic mange (scabies). another is mange caused by demodex mites (demodicosis), though this form of mange is not contagious. another contagious infestation is caused by a mite, cheyletiella. dogs can be infested with contagious lice.
other ectoparasites, including flea and tick infestations are not considered directly contagious but are acquired from an environment where other infested hosts have established the parasite's life cycle.
ringworm is a fungal skin infection and is more common in puppies than in adult dogs.

non-contagious skin infections can result when normal bacterial or fungal skin flora is allowed to proliferate and cause skin disease. common examples in dogs include staphylococcus intermedius pyoderma, and malassezia dermatitis caused by overgrowth of malassezia pachydermatis.
alabama rot, which is believed to be caused by e. coli toxins, also causes skin lesions and eventual kidney failure in 25% of cases.


=== flea allergy dermatitis ===


== hereditary and developmental skin diseases ==
some diseases are inherent abnormalities of skin structure or function. these include seborrheic dermatitis, ichthyosis, skin fragility syndrome (ehlers-danlos), hereditary canine follicular dysplasia and hypotrichosis, such as color dilution alopecia.
juvenile cellulitis, also known as puppy strangles, is a skin disease of puppies of unknown etiology, which most likely has a hereditary component related to the immune system.


== cutaneous manifestations of internal diseases ==
some systemic diseases can become symptomatic as a skin disorder. these include many endocrine (hormonal) abnormalities, such as hypothyroidism, cushing's syndrome (hyperadrenocorticism), and tumors of the ovaries or testicles.

many canine skin disorders can have a basis in poor nutrition. the supplementation of both omega fatty acids 3 and 6 have been shown to mediate the inflammatory skin response seen in chronic diseases. omega 3 fatty acids are increasingly being used to treat pruritic, irritated skin. a group of dogs supplemented with omega 3 fatty acids (660 mg/kg [300 mg/lb] of body weight/d) not only improved the condition of their pruritus, but showed an overall improvement in skin condition. furthermore, diets lacking in essential fatty acids usually present as matted and unkept fur as the first sign of a deficiency.  eicosapentaenoic acid (epa), a well known omega 3, works by preventing the synthesis of another omega metabolite known as arachidonic acid. arachidonic acid is an omega 6, making it pro-inflammatory. though not always the case, omega 6 fatty acids promote inflammation of the skin, which in turn reduces overall appearance and health. there are skin benefits of both these lipids, as a deficiency in omega 6 leads to a reduced ability to heal and a higher risk of infection, which also diminishes skin health. lipids in general benefit skin health of dogs, as they nourish the epidermis and retain moisture to prevent dry, flaky skin.


=== vitamins ===
vitamins are one of many of the nutritional factors that change the outward appearance of a dog. the fat soluble vitamins a and e play a critical role in maintaining skin health. vitamin a, which can also be supplemented as beta-carotene, prevents the deterioration of epithelial tissues associated with chronic skin diseases and aging.  a deficiency in vitamin a can lead to scaly of skin and other dermatitis-related issues like alopecia. vitamin e  is an antioxidant. vitamin e neutralizes free radicals that accumulate in highly proliferative cells like skin and prevent the deterioration of fibrous tissue caused by these ionized molecules. there are also a couple of water-soluble vitamins that contribute to skin health. riboflavin (b2) is a cofactor to the metabolism of carbohydrates and when deficient in the diet leads to cracked, brittle skin. biotin (b7) is another b vitamin that, when deficient, leads to alopecia.


=== minerals ===
minerals have many roles in the body, which include acting as beneficial antioxidants. selenium is an essential nutrient, that should be present in trace amounts in the diet. like other antioxidants, selenium acts as a cofactor to neutralize free radicals. other minerals act as essential cofactors to biological processes relating to skin health. zinc plays a crucial role in protein synthesis, which aids in maintaining elasticity of skin. by including zinc in the diet it will not only aid in the development of collagen and wound healing, but it will also prevent the skin from becoming dry and flaky. copper is involved in multiple enzymatic pathways. in dogs, a deficiency in copper results in incomplete keratinization leading to dry skin and hypopigmentation. the complicated combination of trace minerals in the diet are a key component of skin health and a part of a complete and balanced diet.

heme oxygenase 2 (human),protein,"heme oxygenase or haem oxygenase (ho) is an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of heme to produce biliverdin, ferrous iron, and carbon monoxide. ho is the major catalyst for carbon monoxide production in the human body.


== heme oxygenase ==
heme oxygenase is a heme-containing member of the heat shock protein (hsp) family identified as hsp32. ho-1 is a 32kda enzyme which contains 288 amino acid residues. ho is located in the endoplasmic reticulum, though it has also been reported in the mitochondria, cell nucleus, and plasma membrane.ho catalyzes the degradation of heme to biliverdin/bilirubin, ferrous iron, and carbon monoxide. though present throughout the body, ho has significant activity in the spleen in the degradation of hemoglobin during erythrocyte recycling (0.8% of the erythrocyte pool per day), which accounts for ~80% of heme derived endogenous co production. the remaining 20% of heme derived co production is largely attributed to hepatic catabolism of hemoproteins (myoglobin, cytochromes, catalase, peroxidases, soluble guanylate cyclase, nitric oxide synthase) and ineffective erythropoiesis in bone marrow. ho enzymes are degraded via ubiquitination. in humans three isoforms of heme oxygenase are known.


=== heme oxygenase 1 ===
heme oxygenase 1 (ho-1) is a stress-induced isoform present throughout the body with highest concentrations in the spleen, liver, and kidneys. ho-1 is a 32kda enzyme containing 288 amino acid residues which is encoded by the hmox1 gene.  a study has found levels of ho-1 in lung tissue were directly related to infection with tuberculosis or infection-free areas, and knockout mice were found susceptible, showing the essential role of this enzyme. ho-1 protects cells by reducing superoxide and other reactive oxygen species.


=== heme oxygenase 2 ===
heme oxygenase 2 (ho-2) is a constitutive isoform that is expressed under homeostatic conditions in the testes, endothelial cells and the brain. ho-2 is encoded by the hmox2 gene. ho-2 is 36 kda and shares 47% similarity with the ho-1 amino acid sequence.


=== heme oxygenase 3 ===
a third heme oxygenase (ho-3) is considered to be catalytically inactive and is thought to work in heme sensing or heme binding. ho-3 is 33 kda with greatest presence in the liver, prostate, and kidneys.


=== microbial heme oxygenase ===
heme oxygenase is conserved across phylogenetic kingdoms. the european bioinformatics institute's interpro taxonomy database indicates there are 4,347 bacteria species, 552 fungi species, and 6 archaea species expressing a ho-1-like enzymes. microbial ho homologues use different abbreviation such as hmx1 in saccharomyces cerevisiae, hmu o in corynebacterium diphtheriae, and chu s in escherichia coli. a critical role of the prokaryotic ho systems is to facilitate acquisition of nutritional iron from a eukaryotic host. some ho-like prokaryotic enzymes are inactive or do not liberate co. certain strains of escherichia coli express the non-co producing chu w isoform, whilst ho-like enzymes in other microbes have been reported to produce formaldehyde.the human microbiome contributes to endogenous carbon monoxide production in humans.


== reaction ==
heme oxygenase cleaves the heme ring at the alpha-methene bridge to form either biliverdin or, if the heme is still attached to a globin, verdoglobin. biliverdin is subsequently converted to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase. the reaction comprises three steps, which may be:
heme b3+ + o2 + nadph + h+→  α-meso-hydroxyheme3+ + nadp++ h2o
α-meso-hydroxyheme3+ + h++ o2 → verdoheme4+ + co + h2o
verdoheme4+ + 7/2 nadph + o2+ 3/2 h+ → biliverdin + fe2+ + 7/2 nadp++ h2othe sum of these reactions is:

heme b3+ + 3o2 + 9/2 nadph + 7/2 h+ → biliverdin + fe2+ + co + 9/2 nadp++ 3h2oif the iron is initially in the +2 state, the reaction could be:

heme b2+ + 3o2 + 4 nadph + 4 h+ →  biliverdin + fe2+ + co + 4 nadp+ + 3h2o
this reaction can occur in virtually every cell; the classic example is the formation of a contusion, which forms different chromogens as it gradually heals: (red) heme to (green) biliverdin to (yellow) bilirubin.  in terms of molecular mechanisms, the enzyme facilitates the intramolecular hydroxylation of one meso carbon centre in the heme.


== inducers ==
ho-1 is induced by countless molecules including heavy metals, statins, paclitaxel, rapamycin, probucol, nitric oxide, sildenafil, carbon monoxide, carbon monoxide-releasing molecules, and porphyrins.phytochemical inducers of ho include: curcumin, resveratrol, piceatannol, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, dimethyl fumarate, fumaric acid esters, flavonoids, chalcones, ginkgo biloba, anthrocyanins, phlorotannins, carnosol, rosolic acid, and numerous other natural products.endogenous inducers include i) lipids such as lipoxin and epoxyeicosatrienoic acid; and ii) peptides such as adrenomedullin and apolipoprotein; and iii) hemin.nrf2 inducers with downstream ho-1 induction include: genistein, 3-hydroxycoumarin, oleanolic acid, isoliquiritigenin, peitc, diallyl trisulfide, oltipraz, benfotiamine, auranofin, acetaminophen, nimesulide, paraquat, ethoxyquin, diesel exhaust particles, silica, nanotubes, 15-deoxy-δ12,14 prostaglandin j2, nitro-oleic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and succinylacetone.


== roles in physiology ==
preliminary studies suggest both potential therapeutic and toxic effects of heme oxygenase across different disease processes. these effects have not been tested in human randomized trials.


=== endogenous carbon monoxide ===

the first detection of co in humans was in 1949. sjöstrand determined that co originated from the alpha-methene carbon of heme, setting the stage for the molar ratio between hemin degradation and co production to be established. ho is the main source of endogenous co production, though other minor contributors have been identified in recent years. co is formed at a rate of 16.4 μmol/hour in the human body, ~86% originating from heme via heme oxygenase and ~14% from non-heme sources including: photooxidation, lipid peroxidation, and xenobiotics. the average carboxyhemoglobin (co-hb) level in a non-smoker is between 0.2% and 0.85% co-hb (whereas a smoker may have between 4% and 10% co-hb), though geographic location, occupation, health and behavior are contributing variables. among these, the microbial ho system within the digestive tract is believed to contribute to systemic co-hb concentrations.


== history ==
ho was first described in the late 1960s when raimo tenhunen demonstrated an enzymatic reaction for heme catabolism.

ec 1.14.99.3"
piano sonata no. 3 (beethoven),non_science,"ludwig van beethoven's piano sonata no. 3 in c major, op. 2, no. 3, is a sonata written for solo piano, composed in 1795. it is dedicated to joseph haydn and is often referred to as beethoven's first virtuosic piano sonata. the three op. 2 sonatas all contain four movements each, an unusual length which seems to show that beethoven was aspiring towards composing a symphony. it is both the weightiest and longest of the three op. 2 sonatas, lasting over 25 minutes, presenting many difficulties, including difficult trills, awkward hand movements, and forearm rotation. it is beethoven's second longest piano sonata in his early period, only to beethoven's grand sonata in e♭ major, op. 7, published a year later.


== structure ==
the sonata, in c major, consists of four movements:


=== i. allegro con brio ===

the first movement follows the sonata allegro format of the classical period, and borrows thematically from beethoven's piano quartet no. 3 in c major, woo 36, from a decade earlier. the movement opens with the main theme in the tonic key, beginning with a double-thirds trill-like pattern. this opening passage is infamous for pianists to play, and arthur rubinstein even used this passage to test pianos before performing on them. this pattern leads into an energetic outburst of a broken-chord and broken-octave section. the second theme of the exposition begins in the key of g minor, and is repeated in d minor at measure 33. it is not until measure 47 that the traditional dominant key is finally reached, where a subsidiary theme in the second thematic group appears, marked ""dolce."" a forte shows later, leading to a very rich melody with left and right hand. then a similar outburst of a broken-chord and broken-octave sections appears in fortissimo. then it ends with some difficult trills and an octave scale. beethoven opens the development by improvising on trill patterns introduced in the end of the exposition, which are much more difficult to play. following a broken-chords section filled with harmony changes, the main theme is restated in d major (pianissimo), the supertonic key of c major. then a fortissimo and beethoven's very common syncopations appears in the music giving a rhythm, this continues on to the resolution. the recapitulation is a key change from g major to c major, which is finished by a cadenza, which begins with a sudden a-flat major chord. the cadenza is very light and vibrant and it ends with a long trill and descending chromatic scale in the right hand. the first movement is about 10 minutes long and is one of beethoven's longest movements from his early period.


=== ii. adagio ===

the second movement is marked adagio and written in the key of e major. it is in rondo form, a–b–a–c–a–coda, written in the style of a string quartet, as there are four clear voices. the middle section, in e minor, contains numerous examples of romanticism, and is considered a prelude to the master's later sonatas. later in the movement, the e minor passage is repeated in e major.


=== iii. scherzo: allegro ===

the third movement, a scherzo, is written in minuet and trio form. it opens with a joke-like statement, and the composer uses some polyphony. the trio is in the relative minor key of c major (a minor) and contains running arpeggios in the right hand with the left hand playing a melodic line in octave form. the coda of this short movement ends the scherzo softly with a tritone substitute authentic cadence. 


=== iv. allegro assai ===

the final movement, listed as a rondo, is in the sonata rondo form. the movement opens with an ascending run of first inversion chords in the right hand, which is the movement's main theme. like the first movement, the second theme in the exposition is also written in g major. the great speed of this movement, combined with numerous examples of beethoven's virtuoso skill such as the triple trill at the very end, makes it challenging for pianists.

23s rrna with mutation conferring resistance to lincosamide antibiotics,antibiotic,"lincosamides are a class of antibiotics, which include lincomycin, clindamycin, and pirlimycin.


== structure ==
lincosamides consist of a pyrrolidine ring linked to a pyranose moiety (methylthio-lincosamide) via an amide bond. hydrolysis of lincosamides, specifically lincomycin, splits the molecule into its building blocks of the sugar and proline moieties.  both of these derivatives can conversely be recombined into the drug itself or a derivative.


== synthesis ==
biosynthesis of lincosamides occurs through a biphasic pathway, in which propylproline and methylthiolincosamide are independently synthesized immediately before condensation of the two precursor molecules. condensation of the propylproline carboxyl group with the methylthiolincosamide amine group via an amide bond forms n-demethyllincomycin. n-demethyllincomycin is subsequently methylated via s-adenosyl methionine to produce lincomycin a.lincomycin is naturally produced by bacteria species, namely streptomyces lincolnensis, s. roseolus, and s. caelestis. clindamycin is derived via (7s)-chloro-substitution of the (7r)-hydroxyl group of lincomycin. lincomycin is primarily isolated from fermentations of streptomyces lincolnensis, while clindamycin is prepared semi-synthetically. while several hundred synthetic and semi-synthetic derivatives of lincosamides have been prepared, only lincomycin a and clindamycin are used in clinical practice due to issues with toxicity and low biological activity in other lincosamide antibiotics.


== mechanism of action ==
lincosamides prevent bacterial replication in a bacteriostatic mechanism by interfering with the synthesis of proteins.
in a mechanism similar to macrolides and streptogramin b, lincosamides bind close to the peptidyl transferase center on the 23s portion of the 50s subunit of bacterial ribosomes. high resolution x-ray structures of clindamycin and ribosomal subunits from bacterium have previously revealed exclusive binding to the 23s segment of the peptidyl transferase cavity. binding is mediated by the mycarose sugar moiety which has partially overlapping substrates with peptidyl transferase. by extending to the peptidyl transferase center, lincosamides cause the premature dissociation of peptidyl-trna's containing two, three or four amino acid residues. in this case, peptides will grow to a certain point until steric hindrance inhibits peptidyl transferase activity. lincosamides do not interfere with protein synthesis in human cells (or those of other eukaryotes) due to structural differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes. lincosamides are used against gram positive bacteria since they are unable to pass through the porins of gram-negative bacteria.


== resistance ==


=== ribosomal methylation ===
soon after the emergence of clinical lincosamide use in 1953, strains of resistant staphylococci were isolated in several countries including france, japan and the united states.  resistant strains were characterized by expression of methyltransferases which dimethylate residues within the 23s subunit of ribosomal rna, preventing binding of macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins b. the gene family responsible for encoding of these methyltransferases is referred to as the ""erm"" family, or erythromycin ribosome methylase family of genes. nearly 40 erm genes have been reported to date, which are transferred primarily through plasmids and transposons. 


=== target mutation ===
several strains of bacteria which are highly resistant to macrolide treatment have been isolated and found to possess mutations at the transferase binding pocket in the 23s ribosomal subunit.  macrolide-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from hospital patients in eastern europe and north america were found to contain mutations in either 23s or other ribosomal protein genes.


=== antibiotic efflux ===
gram-negative bacteria harbor genes encoding for molecular pumps which can contribute to resistance of hydrophobic compounds like macrolides and lincosamides. out of the many families of multidrug resistance pumps,  lincosamides are most commonly shunted through pumps belonging to the resistance-nodulation-cell division superfamily. staphylococci express efflux pumps with specificity for 14 and 15 member ring macrolides and streptogramin b, but not lincosamide molecules.


=== drug modification ===
clinical isolates of s. aureus harboring genes which encode for lincosamide nucleotransferases have been reported. genes lnua and lnub confer resistance to lincomycin, but not clindamycin. these genes, however, limit the bactericidal activity of clindamycin. this type of resistance is rare in s. aureus, but has been reported to be more prevalent in other bacteria strains.


== pharmacokinetics ==
approximately 90% of orally administered lincosamides are absorbed, with slight variance depending on which drug is given. plasma concentrations via this route peak within 2–4 hours. intramuscular administration of lincosamides results in strong absorption, with peak plasma levels being reached in 1–2 hours.  around 90% of clindamycin is bound to plasma proteins, and is generally more stable and rapidly absorbed than lincomycin.lincosamides have a broad distribution in several tissues, excluding cerebrospinal fluid. when administered intramuscularly to rats, lincomycin was found to accumulate in highest concentrations in the kidneys when compared to other tissues, while clindamycin was found in highest concentrations within the lungs. clindamycin accumulates in macrophages and other white blood cells, which can result in concentrations 50 times higher than plasma levels.


== clinical use ==
lincosamides are often used clinically as an alternative antibiotic for patients who are allergic to penicillin. of the lincosamides, clindamycin is most commonly used within the clinic due to its higher bioavailability, higher oral absorption and efficacy within the target organism spectrum. lincosamides are generally the first-choice use antibiotic class in veterinary microbiology, most commonly used to combat skin infections.potential clinical uses for lincosamide antibiotics in humans are numerous. they are efficacious in the treatment of dental infections, abdominal infections, abscesses, pelvic inflammatory disease and anaerobic infections.  clindamycin alone has been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of acne, toxic shock syndrome and malaria, and to decrease the risk of premature births in women with bacterial vaginosis. lincosamide antibiotics may also be useful in the treatment of methicillin-resistant s. aureus. [1]


== toxicity and interactions ==
while there have been no reports of severe organ toxicity from lincosamide treatment, gastrointestinal disturbances have been associated with their administration. pseudomembranous enterocolitis resulting from clindamycin-induced disruption of gastrointestinal flora can be a lethal adverse event observed in several species when used in the veterinary clinic, particularly in horses. at extremely high doses of clindamycin, skeletal muscle paralysis has been demonstrated in several species. lincosamides can interact with anesthetic agents to produce neuromuscular effects.other adverse reactions include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and rash. topical administration of clindamycin may induce contact dermatitis, dryness, burning, itching, scaliness and peeling of the skin.


== lincosamide brand name formulations ==
clindamycin - cleocin,  cleocin pediatric, clindamax vaginal, dalacin

== history ==
the first lincosamide compound discovered was lincomycin, isolated from streptomyces lincolnensis in a soil sample from lincoln, nebraska (hence the bacterial name).

daptomycin resistant gdpd,antibiotic,"cyclic di-amp (also called c-di-amp and c-di-adenosine monophosphate) is a second messenger used in signal transduction in bacteria and archaea. it is present in many gram-positive bacteria, some gram-negative species, and archaea of the phylum euryarchaeota.

it is one of many ubiquitous nucleotide second messengers including cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cgmp), guanosine pentaphosphate ((p)ppgpp), and cyclic di-gmp (c-di-gmp). c-di-amp is a signaling nucleotide used in signaling pathways that trigger outputs by using receptor or target proteins to sense c-di-amp concentrations in the cell.
in bacteria, cyclic di-amp has been implicated in the control of growth, cell wall homeostasis, bacterial biofilm formation and virulence gene expression, heat and osmotic stress regulation and responses, sporulation, potassium transport, lysis, and antibiotic resistance.in humans, cyclic di-amp has been implicated in the control of innate immune response and antiviral response against pathogens. the dinucleotide is also produced by numerous human pathogens, prompting the exploration of numerous c-di-amp-regulating pathways both in humans and in bacteria.


== synthesis ==
cyclic di-amp is synthesized by a membrane-bound diadenylate cyclase (also called diadenylyl cyclase, cda, and dac) enzyme called cdaa (daca). daca condenses two atp molecules to make c-di-amp, releasing 2 pyrophosphates in the process. daca requires a manganese or cobalt metal ion cofactor. most bacteria possess only one dac enzyme, but some bacteria like b. subtilis possess two additional dac enzymes (disa and cdas).cyclic di-amp synthesis is inhibited by the gimm i154f mutation in the lactococcus lactis bacterium. gimm is the phosphoglucosamine mutase enzyme that interconverts glucosamine-6-phosphate to glucosamine-1-phosphate to later form cell wall peptidoglycan and other polymers. the i154f mutation inhibits cda activity by binding to it more strongly than wild-type gimm binds. thus, gimm modulates c-di-amp levels.
synthesis is regulated a number of ways, including negative feedback inhibition and upregulation through a decrease in phosphodiesterase.


== degradation ==
phosphodiesterase (pde) enzymes degrade cyclic di-amp to the linear molecule 5’-papa (phosphadenylyl adenosine). papa is also involved in a feedback inhibition loop that limits gdpp gene-dependent c-di-amp hydrolysis, leading to elevated c-di-amp levels.


== regulation ==
since cyclic di-amp is a signaling nucleotide, it is presumed to adhere to the same regulation pathways, where environmental changes are sensed by synthesis or degradation enzymes, which modulate enzyme concentration. regulation of c-di-amp is critical because high c-di-amp levels lead to abnormal physiology, growth defects, and reduced virulence in infection. in some bacteria, loss of the phosphodiesterases that degrade c-di-amp leads to cell death.it is possible that in addition to enzymatic regulation, intracellular c-di-amp levels can be regulated by active transport via multidrug resistance transporters that secrete c-di-amp from the cytoplasm. listeria monocytogenes has demonstrated such an effect.at high concentrations, cyclic di-amp binds to receptor and target proteins to control specific pathways. elevated c-di-amp levels have also been linked to increased resistance toward cell wall-damaging antibiotics (e.g. β-lactams) and reduced cellular turgor.


=== fatty acid synthesis ===
cyclic di-amp has been linked to fatty acid synthesis regulation in myobacterium smegmatis, the growth of s. aureus in conditions of low potassium, the sensing of dna integrity in b. subtilis, and cell wall homeostasis in multiple species.cell wall precursor, and thus peptidoglycan precursor, biosynthesis activity can also affect c-di-amp levels in the cell. similarly, c-di-amp levels affect peptidoglycan precursor synthesis, suggesting a strong link between the c-di-amp and peptidoglycan synthetic pathways.


=== cell lysis and rna synthesis ===
it is suggested that cyclic di-amp is involved in the regulation of cell lysis. studies have shown that bacterial mutant strains with low c-di-amp levels lysed significantly faster than their parent strains.cyclic di-amp has also been linked to bacterial rna synthesis inhibition. c-di-amp stimulates the production of (p)ppgpp, an alarmone involved in bacterial stringent response.


=== sting pathway ===
in eukaryotic cells, c-di-amp is sensed and subsequently elicits a type i interferon (ifn) response, leading to the activation of defense mechanisms against viral infection. this detection and activation pathway involves sting, tbk1, and irf3. c-di-amp may also stimulate dendritic cells, leading to t cell activation.c-di-amp activates the innate immune pathway sting (stimulator of interferon genes) to detect damaged dna. the nucleotide either binds to the helicase ddx41, which in turn activates the sting pathway, or directly binds to the sting protein. cyclic di-amp has been identified (along with 2’3’-cgamp) as a ligand that induces closing of the sting dimer, leading to sting polymerization and pathway activation. when a type i ifn response is not induced in response to c-di-amp, sting is unable to relocate from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytoplasm for pathway activation, suggesting that c-di-amp is a predominant ligand in sting polymerization, and thus activation, via intracellular translocation.

so2f2  +  roh  +  base  →   roso2f  +  hbase+f−


== use as a fumigant ==
originally developed by the dow chemical company, sulfuryl fluoride is in widespread use as a structural fumigant insecticide to control drywood termites, particularly in warm-weather portions of the southwestern and southeastern united states and in hawaii. less commonly, it can also be used to control rodents, powderpost beetles, deathwatch beetles, bark beetles, and bedbugs. its use has increased as a replacement for methyl bromide, which was phased out because of harm to the ozone layer.  it is an alternative to the use of phosphine, which is acutely toxic.


=== fumigation methodology ===
during application, the building is enclosed and filled with the gas for a period of time, usually at least 16–18 hours, sometimes as long as 72 hours.  the building must then be ventilated, generally for at least 6 hours, before occupants can return. california regulations are such that the tent will be on for three to five days, which includes ventilation.  in the us, sulfuryl fluoride must be transported in a vehicle marked with ""inhalation hazard 2"" placards. most states require a license or certification for the individual applying the fumigant.
the concentration is continuously monitored and maintained at the specified level using electronic equipment. possible leakages are also checked by low range electronic detectors.  reentry to the home is allowed when the concentration level is at or below 5 ppm. sulfuryl fluoride is colorless and odorless, however, during the fumigation process, a warning agent called chloropicrin is first released into the building to ensure that no occupants remain.  tent fumigation is the most effective treatment for the extermination of known and unknown infestations of wood-destroying insects. heat is the only other approved method for whole structure treatment for termites in california.  sulfuryl fluoride provides no protection from future infestations, although heavy re-infestation can take several years since drywood termites have slower growing colonies than ground termites.


=== u.s. perspective ===
sulfuryl fluoride is marketed in the u.s. by three manufacturers, under four different brand names. vikane (dow) (epa reg. no. 62719- 4-za) has been commercially available since the early 1960s, with zythor (marketed by competitor ensystex of north carolina) (epa reg. no. 81824- 1-aa) being more recently introduced gradually as its use is approved by individual states (in florida circa 2004, but not in california until october 2006, for example). sulfuryl fluoride has been marketed as a post-harvest fumigant for dry fruits, nuts, and grains under the trade name profume (u.s. epa reg. no. 62719- 376-aa). most recently drexel chemical company has registered master fume (epa reg. no. 19713-596-aa) for the structural market, competing against vikane and zythor.


== health hazards ==
inhalation of sulfuryl fluoride is hazardous and may result in respiratory irritation, pulmonary edema, nausea, abdominal pain, central nervous system depression, numbness in the extremities, muscle twitching, seizures, and death. these high exposures occurred when people entered into structures illegally during fumigation or after insufficient aeration.  epidemiological studies showed that fumigation workers who used sulfuryl fluoride showed neurological effects, which included reduced performance on cognitive tests and pattern memory tests, and reduced olfactory function.


=== case studies ===
in 2016, a 24-year-old man who allegedly entered an apartment that was being fumigated in fremont, california to commit a burglary was exposed to sulfuryl fluoride and chloropicrin and died shortly thereafter. according to a police officer, he experienced labored breathing and was sweating before he collapsed just a few steps from the first floor window of the apartment he allegedly robbed.in 2015 a 10-year-old boy suffered severe brain damage and lost function of his left arm and leg after his home was treated with sulfuryl fluoride and insufficiently aerated, prompting a criminal investigation by the department of justice and the florida department of agricultural and consumer services. two pest control workers later pled guilty to charges of misuse of the pesticide resulting in the boy's poisoning, and were each sentenced to one year in prison.in 1987 an elderly couple was exposed to sulfuryl fluoride in their house already cleared for reentry. while the fumigation company opened windows and doors, and aerated the house with fans, sulfuryl fluoride level was not measured. it was not detected when the air was sampled 12 days after aeration. the couple experienced weakness, nausea and shortness of breath that evening. the man suffered a seizure and died the following day. his wife’s condition got worse with pulmonary edema, and she died after a cardiovascular arrest 6 days later.


== greenhouse gas ==

based on the first high frequency, high precision, in situ atmospheric and archived air measurements, sulfuryl fluoride has an atmospheric lifetime of 30–40 years, much longer than the 5 years earlier estimated.sulfuryl fluoride has been reported to be a greenhouse gas which is about 4000–5000 times more efficient in trapping infrared radiation (per kg) than carbon dioxide (per kg). the amounts of sulfuryl fluoride released into the atmosphere is about 2000 metric tons per yr. the most important loss process of sulfuryl fluoride is dissolution of atmospheric sulfuryl fluoride in the ocean followed by hydrolysis.

cefazolin injection,drug,"cefazolin, also known as cefazoline and cephazolin, is an antibiotic used for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections. specifically it is used to treat cellulitis, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, endocarditis, joint infection, and biliary tract infections. it is also used to prevent group b streptococcal disease around the time of delivery and before surgery. it is typically given by injection into a muscle or vein.common side effects include diarrhea, vomiting, yeast infections, and allergic reactions. it is not recommended in people who have a history of anaphylaxis to penicillin. it is relatively safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. cefazolin is in the first-generation cephalosporin class of medication and works by interfering with the bacteria's cell wall.cefazolin was patented in 1967 and came into commercial use in 1971. it is on the world health organization's list of essential medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. it is available as a generic medication.


== medical uses ==
cefazolin is used in a variety of infections provided that susceptible organisms are involved. it is indicated for use in the following infections:
respiratory tract infections
urinary tract infections
skin infections
biliary tract infections
bone and joint infections
genital infections
blood infections (sepsis)
endocarditisit can also be used peri-operatively to prevent infections post-surgery, and is often the preferred drug for surgical prophylaxis.there is no penetration into the central nervous system and therefore cefazolin is not effective in treating meningitis.cefazolin has been shown to be effective in treating methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) but does not work in cases of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). in many instances of staphylococcal infections, such as bacteremia, cefazolin is an alternative to penicillin in patients who are allergic to penicillin. however, there is still potential for a reaction to occur with cefazolin and other cephalosporins in patients allergic to penicillin. resistance to cefazolin is seen in several species of bacteria, such as mycoplasma and chlamydia, in which case different generations of cephalosporins may be more effective. cefazolin does not fight against enterococcus, anaerobic bacteria or atypical bacteria among others.


=== bacterial susceptibility ===
as a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, cefazolin and other first-generation antibiotics are very active against gram-positive bacteria and some gram-negative bacteria. their broad spectrum of activity can be attributed to their improved stability to many bacterial beta-lactamases compared to penicillins.


=== spectrum of activity ===
gram-positive aerobes:
staphylococcus aureus (including beta-lactamase producing strains)
staphylococcus epidermidis
streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae and  other strains of streptococcigram-negative aerobes:

escherichia coli
proteus mirabilis


=== non susceptible ===
the following are not susceptible:
methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus
enterococcus
most strains of indole positive proteus (proteus vulgaris)
enterobacter spp.
morganella morganii
providencia rettgeri
serratia spp.
pseudomonas spp.
listeria


== special populations ==


=== pregnancy ===
cefazolin is pregnancy category b, indicating general safety for use in pregnancy. caution should be used in breastfeeding as a small amount of cefazolin enters the breast milk. cefazolin can be used prophylactically against perinatal group b streptococcal infection (gbs). although penicillin and ampicillin are the standard of care for gbs prophylaxis, penicillin-allergic women with no history of anaphylaxis can be given cefazolin instead. these patients should be closely monitored as there is a small chance of an allergic reaction due to the similar structure of the antibiotics.


=== newborns ===
there has been no established safety and effectiveness for use in premature infants and neonates.


=== elderly ===
no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed in clinical trials comparing elderly and younger subjects, however the trials could not eliminate the possibility that some older individuals may have a higher level of sensitivity.


=== additional considerations ===
people with kidney disease and those on hemodialysis may need the dose adjusted. cefazolin levels are not significantly affected by liver disease.
as with other antibiotics, cefazolin may interact with other medications being taken. some important drugs that may interact with cefazolin such as probenecid.


== side effects ==
side effects associated with use of cefazolin therapy include:
common (1-10%): diarrhea, stomach pain or upset stomach, vomiting, and rash.
uncommon (<1%): dizziness, headache, fatigue, itching, transient hepatitis.patients with penicillin allergies could experience a potential reaction to cefazolin and other cephalosporins. as with other antibiotics, patients experiencing watery and/or bloody stools occurring up to three months following therapy should contact their prescriber.like those of several other cephalosporins, the chemical structure of cefazolin contains an n-methylthiodiazole (nmtd or 1-mtd) side-chain. as the antibiotic is broken down in the body, it releases free nmtd, which can cause hypoprothrombinemia (likely due to inhibition of the enzyme vitamin k epoxide reductase) and a reaction with ethanol similar to that produced by disulfiram (antabuse), due to inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase. those with an allergy to penicillin may develop a cross sensitivity to cefazolin.


== mechanism of action ==
cefazolin inhibits cell wall biosynthesis by binding penicillin-binding proteins which stops peptidoglycan synthesis. penicillin-binding proteins are bacterial proteins that help to catalyze the last stages of peptidoglycan synthesis, which is needed to maintain the cell wall. they remove the d-alanine from the precursor of the peptidoglycan. the lack of synthesis causes the bacteria to lyse because they also continually break down their cell walls. cefazolin is bactericidal, meaning it kills the bacteria rather than inhibiting their growth.


== cost ==
cefazolin is relatively inexpensive.


== trade names ==
it was initially marketed by glaxosmithkline under the trade name ancef.other trade names include: cefacidal, cefamezin, cefrina, elzogram, faxilen, gramaxin, kefol, kefzol, kefzolan, kezolin, novaporin, reflin, zinol, and zolicef.

south station (subway),non_science,"south station (also signed as south station under) is a transfer station on the mbta rapid transit red line and bus rapid transit silver line, located at summer street and atlantic avenue in downtown boston, massachusetts. it is a part of the south station complex, the second busiest transportation center in new england. eight mbta commuter rail and three amtrak intercity rail services terminate at south station; many of those passengers then transfer to the subway to reach other destinations in the city. with 24,639 daily boardings by a fy2019 passenger count, south station is the busiest station on the mbta subway system.


== history ==

a station serving south station was located on the atlantic avenue elevated. service on the atlantic avenue ""el"" was discontinued on september 20, 1938. the structure itself was torn down in the spring of 1942. before stairs were added, passengers wishing to change lines from the underground station — itself opened on december 3, 1916 — had to use a paper transfer and go outside to change trains. the underground station had four staircases and one escalator leading from the surface to the mezzanine, and two exit escalators.in 1957, the original fare lobby and the rounded top of the tunnel to the west were removed during construction of the dewey square tunnel. the tunnel was rebuilt with a flat ceiling, while the fare lobby was moved to the east closer to the south station headhouse. in the 1970s, an artwork by sylvana cenci entitled wheels in motion was placed in the station. cenci created the artwork by using explosives to warp a steel plate. she had previously been runner-up in a 1971 competition for public art at state station.

a second renovation began around 1980 and consisted of the adding of a passageway to already existing stairs and escalators upstairs to the main terminal building. an entrance was also added to the federal reserve bank building as well as a passageway under summer street connecting the other street entrances. in 1985, the red line platforms were extended 60 feet on either end to allow 6-car trains.the final renovation was triggered by the massive highway project known as the ""big dig"". since the red line tunnel beneath summer street is perpendicular to atlantic avenue, where the new i-93 northbound tunnel was to be built, builders had to tunnel under the tracks. after the first tunnel was complete, another tunnel was added along with a station for the silver line. since the new tunnel was built at the former fare level, another fare level was constructed a level above. this allowed combined access for the silver and red lines. the original lobby that was destroyed was replaced by stairways. this project was completed at a cost of $35 million. an additional $13 million renovation of the red line level was undertaken.after the first sections of the silver line opened in 2002 and 2004, a phase iii was proposed which would build a tunnel connecting south station and the south boston waterfront section with the washington street section of the line. in 2010, the project was placed on indefinite hold. however, route sl5, operating to a surface stop on essex street at atlantic avenue, began service on october 13, 2009.in early 2005, a blue and white tile mosaic reading 'south station under' was discovered during renovations to the red line platform. the mbta had the mosaic restored to its original condition during the project. network, a 650-square-foot (60 m2) glass mosaic map by ellen harvey, was built on the interior walls of the northeast headhouse in 2019.


== station layout ==
south station under has entrances at street level on all four corners of the intersection of summer street and atlantic avenue. the red line has two tracks and two side platforms on the lower level. silver line sl1, sl2, and sl3 service is provided in a tunnel near the red line, and sl4 service can be accessed at a surface bus top one block south of the station entrances. stops at atlantic avenue and essex street near the bus terminal. there are also underground passageways upstairs to the inter-city rail station and many restaurants.


=== bus connections ===
aside from the silver line, three mbta bus routes stop on summer street east of the station entrances:
4: north station–tide street
7: city point–otis street & summer street
11: city point–bedford street & chauncy street

edward fitzgerald (barrister),non_science,"edward hamilton fitzgerald  is an english barrister who specialises in criminal law, public law, and international human rights law. his work against the death penalty has led him to represent criminals such as: myra hindley, mary bell, maxine carr, various ira prisoners, and abu hamza. fitzgerald is currently the joint head of doughty street chambers.


== early life and education ==
fitzgerald was educated at ladycross preparatory school in seaford, and then downside school in stratton-on-the-fosse, somerset, england, where he joined barlow house. he enjoyed debate and was encouraged to help those less fortunate, including prisoners. fitzgerald went on to study at corpus christi college, oxford where he read literae humaniores (classics), and graduated with a congratulatory first. at oxford, fitzgerald played rugby for corpus christi, became involved in college politics, was elected secretary of the junior common room, spoke regularly at the oxford union, wrote for the university paper, and edited the college magazine. 
after finishing his degree, fitzgerald signed up to the two-year bar course and then took a year off. he volunteered as a drama teacher at kingswood reformatory, bristol, for six months. this inspired him to work further with prisoners. around this time, he worked for mind. following this, he resumed his legal career with a one-year pupillage and he studied at the university of cambridge leaving with a master of philosophy degree.


== career at the bar ==
fitzgerald was called to the bar in 1978 and took silk in 1995. at the age of 27, fitzgerald was a barrister practising at dr johnson's buildings, temple, london, which included helena kennedy, and geoffrey robertson. fitzgerald has appeared in many leading cases involving extradition, appeals over miscarriages of justice, and privy council death row appeals from the commonwealth and caribbean. in successive landmark cases in the house of lords and european court of human rights he has established rights for life-sentence prisoners and those on death row. fitzgerald has been called to the bar in a number of commonwealth jurisdictions, which allowed him to represent death row prisoners in the caribbean at all levels: sentencing hearings in the local courts, in the courts of appeal of belize and the eastern caribbean, and at the privy council.his criminal defence work has led him to represent ""some of the most loathed people ever to appear in court."" his clients have included myra hindley, the moors murderer; mary bell, a child killer; maxine carr; jon venables, one of james bulger's killers various ira prisoners, including róisín mcaliskey; and abu hamza, a controversial muslim cleric. fitzgerald also represented david shayler, a british journalist and former mi5 (security service) officer. in february 2020, fitzgerald represented julian assange at the westminster magistrates' court in london during hearings about assange's extradition to the united states in which fitzgerald asserted that dana rohrabacher as an emissary of president donald trump had offered assange a pardon from trump if assange could show that russians had not obtained and leaked united states democratic party emails in 2016 but, instead, seth rich had been the source of the leaks.


== personal life ==
fitzgerald is married to rebecca fraser, a daughter of the novelist lady antonia fraser and conservative mp sir hugh fraser. the couple have three daughters.


== awards and honours ==
he has been recognised as a leading silk in public and administrative, criminal and criminal extradition law, and received a star ranking for his work in civil liberties in the united kingdom. legal 500 described him as ""a true intellectual giant – a top-class extradition and appellate lawyer"". in june 1998, fitzgerald was awarded the justice award, sponsored by the times, for outstanding contributions to criminal justice. fitzgerald is also the ninth most cited barrister in the uk press, with 70 mentions between july 2006 and 2007. on 25 september 2005, fitzgerald became the ""human rights silk of the year"" at the chambers and partners bar awards. in june 2008, fitzgerald was made a commander of the order of the british empire in the queen's birthday honours list 2008. the award was made in recognition of his services to human rights. in 2009, fitzgerald won the silver jubilee ""legal aid lawyer of the year"" (for outstanding achievement) from the legal aid practitioner's group.


== trusteeships and patronages ==
fitzgerald has been a trustee of the death penalty project since its inception in 2005. fitzgerald is also a patron of the human rights lawyers association. fitzgerald is a trustee of the longford trust, founded in 2002 by admirers of lord longford (1905–2001) to celebrate his achievements and to further his goals in social and prison reform. fitzgerald is also a patron of young legal aid lawyers.

ty transcription activator tec1 phosphorylated 1 (yeast),protein,"transcriptional enhancer factor tef-1 also known as tea domain family member 1 (tead1) and transcription factor 13 (tcf-13) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the tead1 gene. tead1 was the first member of the tead family of transcription factors to be identified.


== structure ==
all members of the tead family share a highly conserved dna binding domain called the tea domain. this dna binding domain has a consensus dna sequence 5’-cattcca/t-3’ that is called the mcat element. the three dimensional structure of the tea domain has been identified [5]. its conformation is close to that of the homeodomain and contains 3 α helixes (h1, h2 and h3). it is the h3 helix that enables tead proteins to bind dna.another conserved domain of tead1 is located at the c terminus of the protein. it allows the binding of cofactors and has been called the yap1 binding domain, because it is its ability to bind this well-known tead proteins co-factor that led to its identification. indeed, tead proteins cannot induce gene expression on their own. they have to associate with cofactors to be able to act


== tissue distribution ==
tead1 is expressed in various tissues including skeletal muscle, pancreas, placenta, lung, and heart.


== orthologs ==
tead proteins are found in many organisms under different names, assuming different functions.  for example, in saccharomyces cerevisiae tec-1 regulates the transposable element ty1 and is involved in pseudohyphale growth (the elongated shape that yeasts take when grown in nutrient-poor conditions). in aspergillus nidulans, the tea domain protein abaa regulates the differentiation of conidiophores. in drosophila the transcription factor scalloped is involved in the development of the wing disc, survival and cell growth. finally in xenopus it has been demonstrated that the ortholog of tead1 regulates muscle differentiation.


== function ==
heart development (myocardium differentiation,
skeletal muscle development (alpha-actin of skeletal muscles),)
smooth muscle development (alpha-actin of smooth muscles),
regulation of myosin heavy chain genes, cardiac muscular genes troponin t and i 
regulation of proliferation,
regulation of apoptosis,


== post-transcriptional modifications ==
protein kinase a (pka) can phosphorylate tead1 at serine 102, after the tea domain. this phosphorylation is needed for the transcriptional activation of the α myhc gene. protein kinase c (pkc) phosphorylates tead1 on serine and threonine next to the last alpha loop in the tea domain. this phosphorylation decreases tead1 binding to the gtiic enhancer.
tead1 can be palmitoylated on a conserved cysteine at the c-term of the protein. this post-translational modification is critical for proper folding of tead proteins and their stability.


== cofactors ==
tead proteins require cofactors to induce the transcription of target genes. tead1 interacts with all members of the src family of steroid receptor coactivators. in hela cells tead1 and src induce gene expression, tead1 interacts with parp (poly-adp ribose polymerase) to regulate smooth muscle α-actin expression. parp can also adp-ribosylate the tead proteins and make the chromatin context favorable to transcription through histone modification, srf (serum response factor) and tead1 together regulate gene expression.tead proteins and mef2 (myocyte enhancer factor 2) interact physically. the binding of mef2 on dna induces and potentiates tead1 recruitment at mcat sequences that are adjacent to mef2 binding sites. this recruitment leads to the repression of the mlc2v (myosin light chain 2 v) and βmhc ( β-myosin heavy chain ) promoter. tead1 and the phosphoprotein max interact in vivo and in vitro. once this complex is formed, these two proteins can regulate the alpha-myosin heavy chain (α-mhc) gene expression.the four vestigial-like (vgll) proteins are able to interact with all teads. the precise function of tead and vgll interaction is still poorly understood. it has been shown that tead/vgll1 complexes promote anchorage-independent cell proliferation in prostate cancer cell lines suggesting a role in cancer progression  moreover, vgll2 interaction with tead1 activates muscle promoter upon c2c12 differentiation and enhances myod-mediated myogenic in 10t1/2. finally the complex tead/vgll4 acts as a default transcriptional repressor.the interaction between yap (yes associated protein 65), taz, a transcriptional coactivator paralog to yap, and all tead proteins was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. in both cases the interaction of the proteins leads to increased tead transcriptional activity. yap/taz are effectors of the hippo tumor suppressor pathway that restricts organ growth by keeping in check cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis in mammals and also in drosophila.

analysis of cancer transcriptome databases (www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa) showed that tead1 is dysregulated in several types of cancers. first in kaposi sarcoma there is a 300-fold increase in tead1 levels. moreover, the increase of tead expression can be detected in basal-like breast cancers, fallopian tube carcinoma, and germ cell tumors. otherwise, in other types of cancer tead expression is decreased, for example in other breast cancer types and in renal or bladder cancers. this dual role can be explained by the different targets and the differential regulation of target genes by tead transcription factors. finally recent studies showed that tead1 and yap in ovarian cancer can induces cell stemness and chemoresistance. and that genetic variant of tead protein and yap are enriched in some cancers.

peroxisomal membrane protein 13 isoform 1 (arabidopsis thaliana),protein,"mitochondrial carriers are proteins from solute carrier family 25 which transfer molecules across the membranes of the mitochondria. mitochondrial carriers are also classified in the transporter classification database. the mitochondrial carrier (mc) superfamily has been expanded to include both the original mitochondrial carrier (mc) family (tc# 2.a.29) and the mitochondrial inner/outer membrane fusion (mmf) family (tc# 1.n.6).


== phylogeny ==
members of the mc family (tc# 2.a.29) are found exclusively in eukaryotic organelles although they are nuclearly encoded. most are found in mitochondria, but some are found in peroxisomes of animals, in hydrogenosomes of anaerobic fungi, and in amyloplasts of plants.
15 paralogues of the mc family are encoded within the genome of saccharomyces cerevisiae. 50 have been identified in humans, 58 in a. thaliana and 35 in s. cerevisiae. the functions of many of the human homologues are unknown, but most of the yeast homologues have been functionally identified. see tcdb for functional assignments


== function ==
many mc proteins preferentially catalyze the exchange of one solute for another (antiport). a variety of these substrate carrier proteins, which are involved in energy transfer, have been found in the inner membranes of mitochondria and other eukaryotic organelles such as the peroxisome and facilitate the transport of inorganic ions, nucleotides, amino acids, keto acids and cofactors across the membrane. such proteins include: 

adp/atp carrier protein (adp-atp translocase; i.e., tc# 2.a.29.1.2)
2-oxoglutarate/malate carrier protein (slc25a11; tc# 2.a.29.2.11) 
phosphate carrier protein (slc25a3; tc# 2.a.29.4.2)
tricarboxylate transport protein (slc25a1, or citrate transport protein; tc# 2.a.29.7.2)
graves disease carrier protein (slc25a16; tc# 2.a.29.12.1)
yeast mitochondrial proteins mrs3 (tc# 2.a.29.5.1) and mrs4 (tc# 2.a.29.5.2)
yeast mitochondrial fad carrier protein (tc# 2.a.29.10.1)
as well as many others.functional aspects of these proteins, including metabolite transport, have been reviewed by dr. ferdinando palmieri and dr. ciro leonardo pierri (2010). diseases caused by defects of mitochondrial carriers are reviewed by palmieri et al. (2008) and by gutiérrez-aguilar and baines 2013. mutations of mitochondrial carrier genes involved in mitochondrial functions other than oxidative phosphorylation are responsible for carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier deficiency, hhh syndrome, aspartate/glutamate isoform 2 deficiency, amish microcephaly, and neonatal myoclonic epilepsy. these disorders are characterized by specific metabolic dysfunctions, depending on the physiological role of the affected carrier in intermediary metabolism. defects of mitochondrial carriers that supply mitochondria with the substrates of oxidative phosphorylation, inorganic phosphate and adp, are responsible for diseases characterized by defective energy production. residues involved in substrate binding in the middle of the transporter and gating have been identified and analyzed.


== structure ==
permeases of the mc family (the human slc25 family) possess six transmembrane α-helices. the proteins are of fairly uniform size of about 300 residues. they arose by tandem intragenic triplication in which a genetic element encoding two spanners gave rise to one encoding six spanners. this event may have occurred less than 2 billion years ago when mitochondria first developed their specialized endosymbiotic functions within eukaryotic cells. members of the mc family are functional and structural monomers although early reports indicated that they are dimers.most mc proteins contain a primary structure exhibiting three repeats, each of about 100 amino acid residues in length, and both the n and c termini face the intermembrane space. all carriers contain a common sequence, referred to as the mcf motif, in each repeated region, with some variation in one or two signature sequences.amongst the members of the mitochondrial carrier family that have been identified, it is the adp/atp carrier (aac; tc# 2.a.29.1.1) that is responsible for importing adp into the mitochondria and exporting atp out of the mitochondria and into the cytosol following synthesis. the aac is an integral membrane protein that is synthesised lacking a cleavable presequence, but instead contains internal targeting information. it consists of a basket shaped structure with six transmembrane helices that are tilted with respect to the membrane, 3 of them ""kinked"" due to the presence of prolyl residues.residues that are important for the transport mechanism are likely to be symmetrical, whereas residues involved in substrate binding will be asymmetrical reflecting the asymmetry of the substrates. by scoring the symmetry of residues in the sequence repeats, robinson et al. (2008) identified the substrate-binding sites and salt bridge networks that are important for transport. the symmetry analyses provides an assessment of the role of residues and provides clues to the chemical identities of substrates of uncharacterized transporters.there are structures of the mitochondrial adp/atp carrier in two different states. one is the cytoplasmic state, inhibited by carboxyatractyloside, in which the substrate binding site is accessible to the intermembrane space, which is confluent with the cytosol, i.e. the bovine mitochondrial adp/atp carrier pdb: 1okc​/pdb: 2c3e​, the yeast adp/atp carrier aac2p pdb: 4c9g​/pdb: 4c9h​, the yeast adp/atp carrier aac3p pdb: 4c9j​/pdb: 4c9q​,  another is the matrix state, inhibited by bongkrekic acid, in which the substrate binding site is accessible to the mitochondrial matrix, i.e. the fungal mitochondrial adp/atp carrier pdb: 6gci​. in addition, there are structures of the calcium regulatory domains of the mitochondrial atp-mg/pi carrier in the calcium-bound state pdb: 4zcu​/pdb: 4n5x​  and mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate carriers in different regulatory states pdb: 4p5x​/pdb: 4p60​/pdb: 4p5w​.


== substrates ==
mitochondrial carriers transport amino acids, keto acids, nucleotides, inorganic ions and co-factors through the mitochondrial inner membrane. the transporters consist  of six transmembrane alpha-helices with threefold pseudo-symmetry.the transported substrates of mc family members may bind to the bottom of the cavity, and translocation results in a transient transition from a 'pit' to a 'channel' conformation. an inhibitor of aac, carboxyatractyloside, probably binds where adp binds, in the pit on the outer surface, thus blocking the transport cycle. another inhibitor, bongkrekic acid, is believed to stabilize a second conformation, with the pit facing the matrix. in this conformation, the inhibitor may bind to the atp-binding site. functional and structural roles for residues in the tmss have been proposed. the mitochondrial carrier signature, px[d/e]xx[k/r], of carriers is probably involved both in the biogenesis and in the transport activity of these proteins. a homologue has been identified in the mimivirus genome and shown to be a transporter for datp and dttp.examples of transported compounds include:

citrate – slc25a1
ornithine – slc25a2, slc25a15
phosphate – slc25a3, slc25a23, slc25a24, slc25a25
adenine nucleotide – slc25a4, slc25a5, slc25a6, slc25a31
dicarboxylate – slc25a10
oxoglutarate – slc25a11
glutamate – slc25a22

extravillous trophoblast,cell,"trophoblasts (from greek 'trephein': to feed; and 'blastos': germinator) are cells that form the outer layer of a blastocyst, and are present four days post fertilization in humans. they provide nutrients to the embryo and develop into a large part of the placenta. they form during the first stage of pregnancy and are the first cells to differentiate from the fertilized egg to become extraembryonic structures and do not directly contribute to the embryo. after gastrulation, the trophoblast is contiguous with the ectoderm of the embryo, and is referred to as the trophectoderm. after the first differentiation, the cells in the human embryo lose their totipotency and are no longer totipotent stem cells because they cannot form a trophoblast. they are now pluripotent stem cells.


== structure ==
the trophoblast proliferates and differentiates into two cell layers at approximately six days after fertilization for humans.


== function ==
trophoblasts are specialized cells of the placenta that play an important role in embryo implantation and interaction with the decidualized maternal uterus. the core of placental villi contain mesenchymal cells and placental blood vessels that are directly connected to the fetus’ circulation via the umbilical cord. this core is surrounded by two layers of trophoblasts, the cytotrophoblast and the syncytiotrophoblast. the cytotrophoblast is a layer of mono-nucleated cells that resides underneath the syncytiotrophoblast. the syncytiotrophoblast is composed of fused cytotrophoblasts which forms a layer that covers the placental surface. the syncytiotrophoblast is in direct contact with the maternal blood that reaches the placental surface. it then facilitates the exchange of nutrients, wastes and gases between the maternal and fetal systems.
in addition, cytotrophoblasts in the tips of villi can differentiate into another type of trophoblast called the extravillous trophoblast. extravillous trophoblasts grow out from the placenta and penetrate into the decidualized uterus. this process is essential not only for physically attaching the placenta to the mother, but also for altering the vasculature in the uterus. this alteration allows an adequate blood supply to the growing fetus as pregnancy progresses. some of these trophoblasts even replace the endothelial cells in the uterine spiral arteries as they remodel these vessels into wide bore conduits that are independent of maternal vasoconstriction. this ensures that the fetus receives a steady supply of blood, and the placenta is not subjected to fluctuations in oxygen that could cause it damage.


== clinical significance ==
the invasion of a specific type of trophoblast (extravillous trophoblast) into the maternal uterus is a vital stage in the establishment of pregnancy. failure of the trophoblast to invade sufficiently is important in the development of some cases of pre-eclampsia. invasion of the trophoblast too deeply may cause conditions such as placenta accreta, placenta increta, or placenta percreta.
gestational trophoblastic disease is a pregnancy-associated concept, forming from the villous and extravillous trophoblast cells in the placenta.choriocarcinoma are trophoblastic tumors that form in the uterus from villous cells.trophoblast stem cells (tscs) are cells that can regenerate and they are similar to embryonic stem cells (escs) in the fact that they come from early on in the trophoblast lifetime. in the placenta, these stem cells are able to differentiate into any trophoblast cell because they are pluripotent.

canagliflozin hydrate,reagent,"sglt2 inhibitors, also called gliflozins, are a class of medications that alter essential physiology of the nephron; unlike sglt1 inhibitors that modulate sodium/glucose channels in the intestinal mucosa. all of these advances are within the influence of the #slc5a gene family. the foremost metabolic effect appears to show that this pharmaceutical class inhibits reabsorption of glucose in the kidney and therefore lower blood sugar. they act by inhibiting sodium-glucose transport protein 2 (sglt2). sglt2 inhibitors are used in the treatment of type ii diabetes mellitus (t2dm). apart from blood sugar control, gliflozins have been shown to provide significant cardiovascular benefit in t2dm patients. several medications of this class have been approved or are currently under development. in studies on canagliflozin, a member of this class, the medication was found to enhance blood sugar control as well as reduce body weight and systolic and diastolic blood pressure.


== medical uses ==
the gliflozins are used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus but are most often used as second- or third-line agents instead of first-line because there are other medications on the market that have much longer safety record and are less expensive than gliflozins.gliflozins may be a good option for patients who are failing with metformin monotherapy, especially if reducing weight is part of the underlying treatment. they are often used in combination therapy, for example the dual therapy metformin plus gliflozin and the triple therapy metformin, sulfonylurea and gliflozin.a systematic review and network meta-analysis (comparing sglt-2 inhibitors, glp-1 agonists and dpp-4 inhibitors) demonstrated that use of sglt2 inhibitors was associated with a 20% reduction in death compared with placebo or no treatment.


== adverse effects ==
genital infections seem to be the most common adverse effect of gliflozins. in clinical trials mycotic infections, urinary tract infections and osmotic diuresis were higher in patients treated with gliflozins.in may 2015, the fda issued a warning that gliflozins can increase risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (dka). by reducing glucose blood circulation, gliflozins cause less stimulation of endogenous insulin secretion or lower dose of exogenous insulin that results in diabetic ketoacidosis. they can specifically cause euglycemic dka (eudka, dka where the blood sugar is not elevated) because of the renal tubular absorption of ketone bodies. a particularly high risk period for ketoacidosis is the perioperative period. sglt2 inhibitors may need to be discontinued before surgery, and only recommended when someone is not unwell, is adequately hydrated and able to consume a regular diet.in september 2015, the fda issued a warning related to canagliflozin (invokana) and canagliflozin/metformin (invokamet) due to decreased bone mineral density and therefore increased risk of bone fractures. using gliflozins in combination therapy with metformin can lower the risk of hypoglycemia compared to other t2dm such as sulfonylureas and insulin.increased risk of lower limb amputation is associated with canagliflozin but further data is needed to confirm this risk associated with different gliflozins. a european medicines agency review concluded that there is a potential increased risk of lower limb amputation (mostly affecting the toes) in people taking canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin.in august 2018, the fda issued a warning of an increased risk of fournier gangrene in patients using sglt2 inhibitors. the absolute risk is considered very low.to lessen the risk of developing ketoacidosis (a serious condition in which the body produces high levels of blood acids called ketones) after surgery, the fda has approved changes to the prescribing information for sglt2 inhibitor diabetes medicines to recommend they be stopped temporarily before scheduled surgery. canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin should each be stopped at least three days before, and ertugliflozin should be stopped at least four days before scheduled surgery.symptoms of ketoacidosis include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, and trouble breathing.


== interactions ==
interactions are important for sglt2 inhibitors because most t2dm patients are taking many other medications. gliflozins appear to increase the diuretic effect of thiazides, loop diuretics and related diuretics and may increase the risk of dehydration and hypotension. it is important to adjust the dose of antidiabetics if the treatment is combination therapy to avoid hypoglycemia. for example, interactions with sulfonylureas have led to severe hypoglycemia presumably due to cytochrome p450.a study has shown that it is safe to consume dapagliflozin along with pioglitazone, metformin, glimepiride, or sitagliptin and dose adjustment is unnecessary for either medication. it is unlikely that food intake has clinical meaningful impact on the efficacy of dapagliflozin, therefore it can be administered without regard to meals.


== members ==
these are the known members of the gliflozin class:

canagliflozin was the first sglt2 inhibitor to be approved for use in the united states. it was approved in march 2013, under the brand name invokana and it was also marketed throughout the eu under the same name.
dapagliflozin is the first sglt2 inhibitor approved anywhere in the world by the eu in 2012. it was approved for use in the united states under the brand name farxiga by the food and drug administration in january 2014. the first oral treatment in combination with insulin to treat type 1 diabetes mellitus in uk and eu.
empagliflozin, approved in the united states in august 2014, under the brand name jardiance by boehringer ingelheim. of the gliflozins, empagliflozin and tofogliflozin have the highest specificity for sglt2 inhibition. it is the only oral medicine for type 2 diabetes that has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death.
ertugliflozin was approved in the united states under the brand name steglatro in december 2017.
ipragliflozin, produced by the japanese company astellas pharma inc. under the brand name suglat, approved in japan january 2014.
luseogliflozin was approved in japan march 2014 under the brand name lusefi and was developed by taisho pharmaceutical.
remogliflozin etabonate was commercially launched first in india by glenmark in may 2019.
sergliflozin etabonate discontinued after phase ii trials.
sotagliflozin is a dual sglt1/sglt2 inhibitor in phase iii trials under the brand name zynquista. developed by lexicon pharmaceuticals. it was planned to be the first oral treatment in combination with insulin to treat type 1 diabetes mellitus. the food and drug administration refused its approval for use in combination with insulin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes.
tofogliflozin was approved in japan in march 2014, under the brand names apleway and deberza developed by sanofi and kowa pharmaceutical.


== mechanism of action ==
sodium glucose cotransporters (sglts) are proteins that occur primarily in the kidneys and play an important role in maintaining glucose balance in the blood. sglt1 and sglt2 are the two most known sglts of this family. sglt2 is the major transport protein and promotes reabsorption from the glomerular filtration glucose back into circulation and is responsible for approximately 90% of the kidney's glucose reabsorption. sglt2 is mainly expressed in the kidneys on the epithelial cells lining the first segment of the proximal convoluted tubule. by inhibiting sglt2, gliflozins prevent the kidneys' reuptake of glucose from the glomerular filtrate and subsequently lower the glucose level in the blood and promote the excretion of glucose in the urine (glucosuria).

the mechanism of action on a cellular level is not well understood. work is underway to define this mechanism as a prodiuretic with great promise. however, it has been shown that binding of different sugars to the glucose site affects the orientation of the aglycone in the access vestibule. so when the aglycone binds it affects the entire inhibitor. together these mechanisms lead to a synergistic interaction. therefore, variations in the structure of both the sugar and the aglycone are crucial for the pharmacophore of sglt inhibitors.dapagliflozin is an example of an sglt-2 inhibitor, it is a competitive, highly selective inhibitor of sglt. it acts via selective and potent inhibition of sglt-2, and its activity is based on each patient's underlying blood sugar control and kidney function. the results are decreased kidney reabsorption of glucose, glucosuria effect increases with higher level of glucose in the blood circulation. therefore, dapagliflozin reduces the blood glucose concentration with a mechanism that is independent of insulin secretion and sensitivity, unlike many other antidiabetic medications. functional pancreatic β-cells are not necessary for the activity of the medication so it is convenient for patients with diminished β-cell function.sodium and glucose are co-transported by the sglt-2 protein into the tubular epithelial cells across the brush-border membrane of the proximal convoluted tubule. this happens because of the sodium gradient between the tubule and the cell and therefore provides a secondary active transport of glucose. glucose is later reabsorbed by passive transfer of endothelial cells into the interstitial glucose transporter protein.
ratios of activity between sglt1 and sglt2 may be helpful in defining expression.


== pharmacology ==
the elimination half-life, bioavailability, protein binding, the blood concentration cmax at time tmax, and other pharmacokinetic parameters of various medications of this class are present in table 2. these medications are excreted in the urine as inactive metabolites.
cmax: maximum serum concentration that drug achieves in body after the drug has been and administrated
tmax: time to achieve maximum plasma concentration
t1/2: biological half-lifein studies that were made on healthy people and people with type ii diabetes mellitus, who were given dapagliflozin in either single ascending dose (sad) or multiple ascending dose (mad) showed results that confirmed a pharmacokinetic profile of the medication. with dose-dependent concentrations the half-life is about 12–13 hours, tmax 1–2 hours and it is protein-bound, so the medication has a rapid absorption and minimal excretion by the kidney.dapagliflozin disposition is not evidently affected by bmi or body weight, therefore the pharmacokinetic findings are expected to be applicable to patients with a higher bmi. dapagliflozin resulted in dose-dependent increases excretions in urinary glucose, up to 47g/d following single-dose administration, which can be expected from its mechanism of action, dapagliflozin.in some long term clinical studies that have been made on dapagliflozin, dapagliflozin was associated with a decrease in body weight which was statistically superior compared to placebo or other active comparators. it is primarily associated with caloric rather than fluid loss.


== structure-activity relationship ==
the structure-activity relationship (sar) of gliflozins is not fully understood.
the most common gliflozins are dapagliflozin, empagliflozin and canagliflozin. the differences in the structures is relatively small. the general structure includes a glucose sugar with an aromatic group in the β-position at the anomeric carbon. in addition to the glucose sugar moiety and the β-isomeric aryl substituent the aryl group is composed of a diarylmethylene structure.
the synthesis of gliflozins involves three general steps. the first one is the construction of the aryl substituent, the next one is the introduction of the aryl moiety onto the sugar or glucosylation of the aryl substituent and the last one the deprotection and modification of the arylated anomeric center of the sugar.phlorizin was the first type of gliflozin and it was non-selective against sglt2/sglt1. it is a natural o-aryl glycoside composed of a d-glucose and an aromatic ketone. however phlorizin is very unstable, it is rapidly degraded by glucosidases in the small intestines, so it can not be used as an oral administration medication to treat diabetes. structural modifications have been made to overcome this instability problem. the most efficient way was to conjugate aryl moiety with glucose moiety since c-glucosides are more stable in the small intestines than o-glucoside derivatives (c-c bond instead of c-o-c bond).

in the sugar analogues of dapagliflozin, the β-c series are more active than α-c series so it is critical that the β-configuration is at c-1 for the inhibitory activity. both dapagliflozin and empagliflozin contain a chlorine (cl) atom in their chemical structure. cl is a halogen and it has a high electronegativity. this electronegativity withdraws electrons off the bonds and therefore it reduces the metabolism. the cl atom also reduces the ic50 value of the medication so the medication has better activity. the carbon-fluorine bond (c-f) has also has a veryl low electron density.

for example in the chemical structure of canagliflozin a fluorine atom is connected to an aromatic ring then the compound is more stable and the metabolism of the compound is reduced. 
empagliflozin contains a tetrahydrofuran ring but not canagliflozin nor dapagliflozin.

in the development of gliflozins the distal ring contains a thiophene ring instead of an aromatic ring. however the final chemical structures of the marketing gliflozins does not contain this thiophene ring.


== alternative pharmacological actions ==
gliflozins have been posited to exhibit protective effects on the heart, liver, kidneys, anti‐hyperlipidemic, anti‐atherosclerotic, anti‐obesity, anti‐neoplastic effects in in vitro, pre‐clinical, and clinical studies. pleiotropic effects of this class have been attributed to a variety of its pharmacodynamic actions such as natriuresis, hemoconcentration, deactivation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, ketone body formation, alterations in energy homeostasis, glycosuria, lipolysis, anti‐inflammatory, and antioxidative actions.


== history ==

phlorizin is a molecule with sglt inhibiting properties, and served an important role in the development of the gliflozin class of medications.

list of u.s. open (golf) broadcasters,non_science,"as of 2020, nbc sports is the official broadcaster of the u.s. open, as the result of a 8–year deal with the usga for exclusive rights to its tournaments through 2027. coverage is telecast by nbc (over-the-air) and nbcsn (cable). coverage was previously televised by nbc and espn through 2014. nbc's most recent period as rights holder began in 1995; abc held the broadcast rights from 1966 through 1994. fox held the broadcast rights from 2015 to 2019.


== coverage overview ==


=== first nbc era (1954–1965) ===
nbc first began televising golf events after it was awarded the television rights to the u.s. open in 1954. the tournament continued to air on the network through the 1965 event, however nbc rebuffed a long-term deal to broadcast the event when the united states golf association (usga) decided on a true contract in 1966. the network, however, did televise a handful of pga tour events over the following decades.


=== abc era (1966–1994) ===
abc broadcast golf events for the first time in 1962 when it began televising the open championship as part of its anthology series wide world of sports. the network later gained the broadcast rights to the pga championship in 1965, and the u.s. open in 1966. chris schenkel and byron nelson were the initial hosts of the tournament coverage. in 1975, jim mckay and dave marr became the lead broadcast team, while bob rosburg joined the network as the first ever on-course reporter, and peter alliss joined as a co-anchor.
beginning in 1982, abc adopted its most well-known format of the wide world of sports era. the broadcast operated using anchor teams, in which an anchor and an analyst would call all of the action from the tower at the 18th hole, and the teams would be rotated on coverage after about a half-hour. meanwhile, the three on-course reporters, which included judy rankin and ed sneed in addition to rosburg, would be utilized when prompted by the anchor team. mckay and marr would be the lead team, with jack whitaker and alliss as the second team. occasionally, rosburg or whitaker would host if mckay was unavailable, while roger twibell would take over the secondary team. after his 1986 masters win, jack nicklaus would appear on abc after the end of his round and served as an analyst for the rest of the telecast.
in 1990, roger twibell took over as lead anchor, with dave marr as his analyst. peter alliss became sole anchor of the second anchor team. during this period, abc acquired the rights to several non-major pga tour events, mostly important events such as the memorial tournament and the tour championship. 1990 would also mark the final pga championship to be broadcast by abc.
in 1992, brent musburger, who had been heavily criticized for his hosting of golf coverage while with cbs, took over as host. marr was dismissed from the network, while twibell was reassigned to espn's golf coverage, although he occasionally hosted on abc for a few lower-level tournaments. the format was also reorganized to more emphasize the on-course reporters. steve melnyk moved over from cbs to become lead analyst; however, alliss would anchor for stretches during the telecast. beyond the team in the booth, all of abc's other voices were on the course, including rankin, rosburg, and newcomer mark rolfing.
in 1993, abc used peter jacobsen as a lead analyst; however, jacobsen returned to playing in 1994 and melnyk returned to the lead analyst position. abc continued to hold the television rights to select pga tour events, with the schedule increasing slightly as a result of a new television deal with the pga tour in 1995, however it still mostly emphasized only the important tournament events. the network lost the rights to the u.s. open following an ugly split from the united states golf association (usga) in 1994. nicklaus held his position of entering the booth during the major championship telecasts through the period from 1992 to 1996.


=== second nbc era (1995–2014) ===
in 1995, nbc sports acquired rights to the usga championships, including the u.s. open, from espn/abc. espn retained rights to a portion of the weekday coverage, however, nbc was the dominant rights holder, including exclusive coverage of the weekend rounds. this took nbc's coverage to a new level and marked the first time in the modern era of television that the network had televised a major championship. nbc, the yanni composed theme music, ""in celebration of man"", and its lead analyst johnny miller (who joined nbc in 1990) became synonymous with the u.s. open, televising it for the next 20 years, through 2014.


=== fox era (2015–2019) ===
on august 6, 2013, fox sports announced a 12-year deal to broadcast the three open championships of the usga: the u.s. open, women's open, and senior open, beginning in 2015. fox succeeded the usga's long-term relationships with nbc sports and espn. fox, which has televised just one pga tour sanctioned event in its history (the unofficial cvs charity classic in 2011), paid $1 billion for full rights to all usga championships.
the fox network airs the final two days of the u.s. open, women's open, senior open, and amateur, as well as late coverage of the first two days of the u.s. open. the rest of the coverage airs on fox sports 1. also, the final two days of the u.s. open air on spanish-language channel fox deportes.on april 23, 2014, fox sports announced that greg norman would join joe buck as its lead golf commentary team. buck and norman worked together for the first time at the 2014 u.s. open, where fox produced studio programming that aired against espn and nbc's studio shows.
on november 18, 2014, in advance of its coverage of the franklin templeton shootout, fox announced the full layout of its golf team.

studio host: holly sondersfor the 2018 u.s. open, fox announced that they would be splitting their lead commentary booths into two teams. this was done in an effort to avoid the occasional logjam caused by a three-man booth, which had been joe buck with analysts paul azinger and brad faxon. therefore, azinger would now be paired with buck, and faxon would be paired alongside shane bacon.
on june 29, 2020, it was confirmed fox had withdrawn from their 12-year deal with the usga, and that nbcuniversal had taken over the remainder of the contract through to 2026.


=== third nbc era (2020–2026) ===
having reacquired broadcasting rights to usga championships, nbc are set to air the rescheduled 2020 u.s. open in september; the tournament had originally been scheduled for june before being postponed due to the covid-19 pandemic.

corbomycin,antibiotic,"corbomycin is a member of the glycopeptide family of antibiotics that are produced by soil bacteria.


== mechanism of action ==
its mechanism of action is to block the function of the bacterial cell wall by attaching to peptidoglycan. the cell can then not divide/reproduce. other antibiotics may instead block the formation of the wall.


== applications ==
it can block infections caused by the drug-resistant strain of staphylococcus aureus that cause serious infections. as of 2020 it had not been approved by any regulatory body for human use.


== history ==
the antibiotic was announced in 2020. researchers found the substance while studying the genes of glycoproteins that lacked resistance mechanisms. researcher beth culp worked with yves brun and his team to image the cells to identify the action site. culp's later team found other antibiotics that employed the same method of action. complestatin is an existing antibiotic that was shown to use the same mechanism of action.

leydig cell,cell,"leydig cells, also known as interstitial cells of leydig, are found adjacent to the seminiferous tubules in the testicle. they produce testosterone in the presence of luteinizing hormone (lh). leydig cells are polyhedral in shape, and have a large prominent nucleus, an eosinophilic cytoplasm and numerous lipid-filled vesicles.


== structure ==
the mammalian leydig cell is a polyhedral epithelioid cell with a single eccentrically located ovoid nucleus. the nucleus contains one to three prominent nucleoli and large amounts of dark-staining peripheral heterochromatin. the acidophilic cytoplasm usually contains numerous membrane-bound lipid droplets and large amounts of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ser). besides the obvious abundance of ser with scattered patches of rough endoplasmic reticulum, several mitochondria are also prominent within the cytoplasm. frequently, lipofuscin pigment and rod-shaped crystal-like structures 3 to 20 micrometres in diameter (reinke crystals) are found. these inclusions have no known function, are found in less than half of all leydig cell tumors, but serve to clinch the diagnosis of a leydig cell tumor. no other interstitial cell within the testes has a nucleus or cytoplasm with these characteristics, making identification relatively easy.


=== development ===
'adult'-type leydig cells differentiate in the post-natal testis and are quiescent until puberty. they are preceded in the testis by a population of 'fetal'-type leydig cells from the 8th to the 20th week of gestation, which produce enough testosterone for masculinisation of a male fetus.


== androgen production ==
leydig cells release a class of hormones called androgens (19-carbon steroids). they secrete testosterone, androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea), when stimulated by the luteinizing hormone (lh) which is released from the anterior pituitary in response to gonadotrophin releasing hormone which in is released by the hypothalamus. lh binds to its receptor (lhcgr) which is a g-protein coupled receptor and consequently increases the production of camp. camp, in turn through protein kinase a activation, stimulates cholesterol translocation from intracellular sources (primarily the plasma membrane and intracellular stores) to the mitochondria, firstly to the outer mitochondrial membrane and then cholesterol needs to be translocated to the inner mitochondrial membrane by steroidogenic acute regulatory protein which is the rate-limiting step in steroid biosynthesis. this is followed by pregnenolone formation from the translocated cholesterol via the cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme which is found in the inner mitochondrial membrane, eventually leading to testosterone synthesis and secretion by leydig cells.prolactin (prl) increases the response of leydig cells to lh by increasing the number of lh receptors expressed on leydig cells.


== clinical significance ==

leydig cells may grow uncontrollably and form a leydig cell tumour. these tumours are usually benign in nature. they may be hormonally active, i.e. secrete testosterone (responsible for male secondary characteristics).
adrenomyeloneuropathy is another example of a disease affecting the leydig cell: the patient's testosterone may fall despite higher-than-normal levels of lh and follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh).
lateral electrical surface stimulation therapy has been found to cause proliferation of leydig cells in rabbits.


== history ==


=== etymology ===
leydig cells are named after the german anatomist franz leydig, who discovered them in 1850.

in 2004 schnappi became popular on the internet. radio station rautemusik began playing schnappi, which led to a single release of ""schnappi, das kleine krokodil"" in december 2004. the single reached number one on germany's gfk entertainment chart on january 3, 2005, staying at the top for 10 weeks. the song was then released worldwide and peaked at number one in austria, belgium, the netherlands, norway, sweden and switzerland in early 2005. it was translated into a french version titled ""crocky le petit crocodile"", a lithuanian version called ""šnapis mažas klokodilas"", and a japanese version entitled ""togetogeshi, chiisai wani"" (刺々し、小さい鰐). belgian techno group dynamite released a cover version that charted at number three in belgium while the original version was still topping the chart.in april, the song began to experience success in australasia. it made its first chart appearance on new zealand's recorded music nz (then rianz) chart at number 32 on april 25. the next week, it jumped to number three before reaching number two for the first time on its third week in. between may 9 and july 18, the single fluctuated around the top 10, eventually spending five non-consecutive weeks at number two, denied the top position by savage's ""moonshine"", the black eyed peas' ""don't phunk with my heart"", and crazy frog's version of ""axel f"". it remained in the top 10 until september 12. on july 17, the song debuted at number 20 on australia's aria singles chart, reaching a peak of number six on august 21.a studio album, schnappi und seine freunde was released through polydor records in february 2005. it peaked at number five in finland, number two in germany, and number one in austria. a second single, ""ein lama in yokohama"" (credited as ""schnappi und das lama""), was released in april 2005 and became another top ten single in austria, germany and norway. it narrowly missed the top 10 in new zealand, reaching number 11, and peaked at number 26 in australia. it became schnappi's last hit in both countries. in november 2005, ""jing! jingeling! der weihnachtsschnappi!"" was released and peaked at number three in norway, but did not reach the top 10 anywhere else. this would become schnappi's last hit in europe. the second and final studio album, schnappi's winterfest, was released in december 2005, only charting in austria and germany at numbers 43 and 25, respectively.

inner root sheath cell,cell,"the hertwig epithelial root sheath (hers) or epithelial root sheath is a proliferation of epithelial cells located at the cervical loop of the enamel organ in a developing tooth.  hertwig epithelial root sheath initiates the formation of dentin in the root of a tooth by causing the differentiation of odontoblasts from the dental papilla.  the root sheath eventually disintegrates with the periodontal ligament, but residual pieces that do not completely disappear are seen as epithelial cell rests of malassez (erm). these rests can become cystic, presenting future periodontal infections.


== structure ==
hertwig epithelial root sheath is derived from the inner and outer enamel epithelium of the enamel organ.


== function ==
the sheath is also responsible for multiple or accessory roots (medial growth) and lateral or accessory canals in the root (break in epithelium). it is controversial, but hers may be involved in cementogenesis and the secreting of cementum, or that hers-derived products might be related to enamel-related molecules, and that these proteins might initiate acellular cementum formation.


== other animals ==
while in mammals the hers is rather a transient structure, in amphibians it is more or less a permanent one. here the root epithelium does not fenestrate like in mammalians. within vertebrates 3 distinct stages of hers development can be observed.

in teleosts and chondrichthyans no hers or root is really formed, and tooth development is restricted to crown development. an inflexible joint is formed between the tooth and the bone at the apical end of the tooth where the epithelium remains open.
in amphibians and non-crocodilian reptiles a continuous root sheath or hers is formed without fragmentation of the epithelium. once again a rather rigid connection between bone and tooth is formed at the apical end of the tooth where no epithelium is present.
in crocodilians and mammals the hers is a transient structure and fragments to form the epithelial cell rests of malassez. through the gaps in the root epithelium elements of the periodontal ligament can migrate and form a flexible connection between bone and root.


== history ==
hertwig epithelial root sheath was not discovered in any mammalian species. instead this epithelial structure was discovered by oskar hertwig in 1874 in an amphibian (see notes below for further discussion in other animals).

magnesium chloride rectal suppository,drug,"laxatives, purgatives, or aperients are substances that loosen stools and increase bowel movements. they are used to treat and prevent constipation.
laxatives vary as to how they work and the side effects they may have. certain stimulant, lubricant and saline laxatives are used to evacuate the colon for rectal and bowel examinations, and may be supplemented by enemas under certain circumstances. sufficiently high doses of laxatives may cause diarrhea.
some laxatives combine more than one active ingredient.
laxatives may be administered orally or rectally.


== types ==


=== bulk-forming agents ===
bulk-forming laxatives, also known as roughage, are substances, such as fiber in food and hydrophilic agents in over-the-counter drugs, that add bulk and water to stools so that they can pass more easily through the intestines (lower part of the digestive tract).properties

site of action: small and large intestines
onset of action: 12–72 hours
examples: dietary fiber, metamucil, citrucel, fiberconbulk-forming agents generally have the gentlest of effects among laxatives, making them ideal for long-term maintenance of regular bowel movements.


==== dietary fiber ====
foods that help with laxation include fiber-rich foods. dietary fiber includes insoluble fiber and soluble fiber, such as:
fruits, such as bananas, though this depends on their ripeness, kiwifruits, prunes, apples (with skin), pears (with skin), and raspberries
vegetables, such as broccoli, string beans, kale, spinach, cooked winter squash, cooked taro and poi, cooked peas, and baked potatoes (with skin)
whole grains
bran products
nuts
legumes, such as beans, peas, and lentils


=== emollient agents (stool softeners) ===
emollient laxatives, also known as stool softeners, are anionic surfactants that enable additional water and fats to be incorporated in the stool, making it easier for them to move through the gastrointestinal tract.
properties

site of action: small and large intestines
onset of action: 12–72 hours
examples: docusate (colace, diocto), gibs-ezeemollient agents prevent constipation rather than treating long-term constipation.


=== lubricant agents ===
lubricant laxatives are substances that coat the stool with slippery lipids and decrease colonic absorption of water so that the stool slides through the colon more easily. lubricant laxatives also increase the weight of stool and decrease intestinal transit time.properties

site of action: colon
onset of action: 6–8 hours
example: mineral oilmineral oil is the only nonprescription lubricant. mineral oil may decrease the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and some minerals.


=== hyperosmotic agents ===
hyperosmotic laxatives are substances that cause the intestines to hold more water within and create an osmotic effect that stimulates a bowel movement.properties

site of action: colon
onset of action: 12–72 hours (oral) 0.25–1 hour (rectal)
examples: glycerin suppositories (hallens), sorbitol, lactulose, and peg (colyte, miralax)lactulose works by the osmotic effect, which retains water in the colon, lowering the ph through bacterial fermentation to lactic, formic and acetic acid, and increasing colonic peristalsis. lactulose is also indicated in portal-systemic encephalopathy. glycerin suppositories work mostly by hyperosmotic action, but the sodium stearate in the preparation also causes local irritation to the colon.
solutions of polyethylene glycol and electrolytes (sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, potassium chloride, and sometimes sodium sulfate) are used for whole bowel irrigation, a process designed to prepare the bowel for surgery or colonoscopy and to treat certain types of poisoning. brand names for these solutions include golytely, glycolax, colyte, miralax, movicol, nulytely, suprep, and fortrans. solutions of sorbitol (softlax) have similar effects.


=== saline laxative agents ===
saline laxatives are non-absorbable osmotically active substances that attract and retain water in the intestinal lumen, increasing intraluminal pressure that mechanically stimulates evacuation of the bowel. magnesium-containing agents also cause the release of cholecystokinin, which increases intestinal motility and fluid secretion. saline laxatives may alter a patient's fluid and electrolyte balance.
properties

site of action: small and large intestines
onset of action: 0.5–3 hours (oral), 2–15 minutes (rectal)
examples: sodium phosphate (and variants), magnesium citrate, magnesium hydroxide (milk of magnesia), and magnesium sulfate (epsom salt)


=== stimulant agents ===
stimulant laxatives are substances that act on the intestinal mucosa or nerve plexus, altering water and electrolyte secretion. they also stimulate peristaltic action and can be dangerous under certain circumstances.properties

site of action: colon
onset of action: 6–10 hours
examples: senna, bisacodylprolonged use of stimulant laxatives can create drug dependence by damaging the colon's haustral folds, making a user less able to move feces through the colon on their own. a study of patients with chronic constipation found that 28% of chronic stimulant laxative users lost haustral folds over the course of one year, while none of the control group did.


=== miscellaneous ===
castor oil is a glyceride that is hydrolyzed by pancreatic lipase to ricinoleic acid, which produces laxative action by an unknown mechanism.
properties

site of action: colon
onset of action: 2–6 hours
examples: castor oillong-term use of castor oil may result in loss of fluid, electrolytes, and nutrients.


=== serotonin agonist ===
these are motility stimulants that work through activation of 5-ht4 receptors of the enteric nervous system in the gastrointestinal tract. however, some have been discontinued or restricted due to potentially harmful cardiovascular side-effects.
tegaserod (brand name zelnorm) was removed from the general u.s. and canadian markets in 2007, due to reports of increased risks of heart attack or stroke. it is still available to physicians for patients in emergency situations that are life-threatening or require hospitalization.prucalopride (brand name resolor) is a current
drug approved for use in the eu since october 15, 2009, in canada (brand name resotran) since december 7, 2011, and in the united states since december 2018.


=== chloride channel activators ===
lubiprostone is used in the management of chronic idiopathic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome. it causes the intestines to produce a chloride-rich fluid secretion that softens the stool, increases motility, and promotes spontaneous bowel movements (sbm).


== comparison of available agents ==


=== effectiveness ===
for adults, a randomized controlled trial found peg (miralax or glycolax) 17 grams once per day to be superior to tegaserod at 6 mg twice per day. a randomized controlled trial found greater improvement from two sachets (26 grams) of peg versus two sachets (20 grams) of lactulose. 17 grams per day of peg has been effective and safe in a randomized controlled trial for six months. another randomized controlled trial found no difference between sorbitol and lactulose.for children, peg was found to be more effective than lactulose.


== problems with use ==


=== laxative abuse ===
some of the less significant adverse effects of laxative abuse include dehydration (which causes tremors, weakness, fainting, blurred vision, kidney damage), low blood pressure, fast heart rate, postural dizziness and fainting; however, laxative abuse can lead to potentially fatal acid-base and electrolyte imbalances. for example, severe hypokalaemia has been associated with distal renal tubular acidosis from laxative abuse. metabolic alkalosis is the most common acid-base imbalance observed. other significant adverse effects include rhabdomyolysis, steatorrhoea, inflammation and ulceration of colonic mucosa, pancreatitis, kidney failure, factitious diarrhea and other problems. colon will need more quantities of laxatives to keep functioning, this will result in a lazy colon, infections, irritable bowel syndrome, and potential liver damages.
although patients with eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa frequently abuse laxatives in an attempt to lose weight, laxatives act to speed up the transit of feces through the large intestine, which occurs after the absorption of nutrients in the small intestine is already complete. thus, studies of laxative abuse have found that effects on body weight reflect primarily temporary losses of body water rather than energy (calorie) loss.


=== laxative gut ===
physicians warn against the chronic use of stimulant laxatives due to concern that chronic use could cause the colonic tissues to get worn out over time and not be able to expel feces due to long-term overstimulation.  a common finding in patients having used stimulant laxatives is a brown pigment deposited in the intestinal tissue, known as melanosis coli.


== historical and quackery uses ==
laxatives, once called physicks or purgatives, were used extensively in pre-modern medicine to treat many conditions for which they are now generally regarded as ineffective in evidence-based medicine. likewise, laxatives (often termed colon cleanses) may be promoted in alternative medicine for various conditions of quackery, such as ""mucoid plaque"".

siva (director),non_science,"sivakumar jayakumar, known professionally as siva or siruthai siva, is an indian filmmaker who has worked in tamil and telugu cinema as a film director and cinematographer. since his tamil directorial debut, siruthai (2011), the media has often incorporated the film's title in his name to refer to him.


== career ==
although he always wanted to become a filmmaker, he pursued photography. in 1998, siva became a gold medalist from m.g.r. government film and television training institute he went on to work with cinematographer jayanan vincent. siva then came to hyderabad to work for venkatesh' film jayam manade raa (2000) as an operative cameraman. in 2002, he became an independent cinematographer, shortly after his brother bala, made his acting debut. he has shot for about 15 films since then.
in 2008, he narrated a script to actor gopichand who agree to play the lead role. souryam, co-starring gopichand along with anushka shetty was siva's directorial debut. the following year, siva made his second film, again with gopichand in the lead. in 2011, siva made his debut as a director in tamil cinema with siruthai, a remake of s. s. rajamouli's telugu action masala vikramarkudu. the film, featuring karthi in the starring role, went on to become a high commercial success, which led to him being referred to as ""siruthai"" siva in tamil cinema from then on. his fourth directorial, daruvu, released in may 2012.
in december 2011, siva was signed by vijaya productions to direct a film for their centenary year with ajith kumar signed on to play the leading role. ajith kumar requested siva to rework the script to make it as a rural story and production began after a brief delay in 2013. he has given film with ajith titled as veeram (2014) which was the biggest commercial hit on his directorial ventures and told the story of a village do-gooder and his brothers. the film opened in january 2014 to positive reviews and commercial success. his third film in tamil titled vedhalam (2015) becomes blockbuster movie starring ajith alongside an ensemble cast including shruti hassan and rahul dev. his fourth film in tamil titled vivegam (2017) was a blockbuster movie in which ajith and siva worked together. it released in august 2017 and got mixed criticized by reviewers. his next movie with ajith kumar, viswasam (2019), which was produced by sathya jyothi films, was released to positive reviews from the audience and was declared a blockbuster at the box office after 5 days. the movie was praised for its portrayal of bond between a father and his daughter.

serine/threonine-protein phosphatase with ef-hands 1 isoform h2 (human),protein,"myosin regulatory light chain 2, ventricular/cardiac muscle isoform (mlc-2) also known as the regulatory light chain of myosin (rlc) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the myl2 gene. this cardiac ventricular rlc isoform is distinct from that expressed in skeletal muscle (mylpf), smooth muscle (myl12b) and cardiac atrial muscle (myl7).ventricular myosin light chain-2 (mlc-2v) refers to the ventricular cardiac muscle form of myosin light chain 2 (myl2). mlc-2v is a 19-kda protein composed of 166 amino acids, that belongs to the ef-hand ca2+ binding superfamily. mlc-2v interacts with the neck/tail region of the muscle thick filament protein myosin to regulate myosin motility and function.


== structure ==
cardiac, ventricular rlc is an 18.8 kda protein composed of 166 amino acids. rlc and the second ventricular light chain, essential light chain (elc, myl3), are non-covalently bound to iqxxxrgxxxr motifs in the 9 nm s1-s2 lever arm of the myosin head, both alpha (myh6) and beta (myh7) isoforms. both light chains are members of the ef-hand superfamily of proteins, which possess two helix-loop-helix motifs in two globular domains connected by an alpha-helical linker.


== function ==
the n-terminal ef-hand domain of rlc binds calcium/magnesium at activating concentrations, however the dissociation rate is too slow to modulate cardiac contractility on a beat-by-beat basis. perturbing the calcium binding region of rlc through site-directed mutagenesis (d47a) decreased tension and stiffness in isolated, skinned skeletal muscle fibers, suggesting that the conformational change induced by calcium binding to rlc is functionally important.another mode of rlc modulation lies in its ability to be modified by phosphorylation and deamidation in the n-terminal region, resulting in significant charge alterations of the protein. rlc is phosphorylated by a cardiac-specific myosin light chain kinase (mylk3), which was recently cloned. studies have supported a role for myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 2 (mypt2,ppp1r12b) in the dephosphorylation of rlc. human rlc has an asparagine at position 14 (threonine in mouse) and a serine at position 15 (same in mouse). endogenous rlc exists as a mixture of unmodified (typically ~50%), singly-modified (either n14 deamidation or s15 phosphorylation) and doubly modified (n14 deamidation and s15 phosphorylation) protein. both deamidation and phosphorylation contribute negative charge to the n-terminal region of rlc, undoubtedly altering its interaction with the c-terminal myosin alpha helical domain. functional studies have supported a role for rlc phosphorylation in modulating cardiac myosin crossbridge kinetics. it is well established that rlc phosphorylation enhances myofilament sensitivity to calcium in isometrically-contracting, skinned cardiac fibers. it was also demonstrated that a lack of rlc phosphorylation decreases tension cost (isometric force/atpase rate at a given pca), suggesting that rlc phosphorylation augments cycling kinetics of myosin. it has been proposed that rlc phosphorylation promotes a ""swing-out"" of myosin heads, facilitating weak-to-strong crossbridge binding to actin per unit calcium. additional insights regarding rlc phosphorylation in beating hearts have come from in vivo studies. adult mice expressing a non-phosphorylatable cardiac rlc (tg-rlc(p-)) exhibited significant decreases in load-dependent and load-independent measures of contractility. in tg-rlc(p-), the time for the heart to reach peak elastance during ejection was elongated, ejection capacity was decreased and the inotropic response to dobutamine was blunted. it is also clear that ablation of rlc phosphorylation in vivo induces alterations in the phosphorylation of other sarcomeric proteins, namely  cardiac myosin binding protein c and cardiac troponin i. moreover, rlc phosphorylation, specifically, appears to be necessary for a normal inotropic response to dobutamine. in agreement with these findings, a second in vivo model, cardiac myosin light chain kinase (mylk3) knockout (cmlck neo/neo), showed depressed fractional shortening, progressing to left ventricular hypertrophy by 4–5 months of age. taken together, these studies clearly demonstrate that rlc phosphorylation regulates cardiac dynamics in beating hearts, and is critical for eliciting a normal sympathetic response.


== expression patterns during cardiac development ==
mlc-2v plays an essential role in early embryonic cardiac development and function. and represents one of the earliest markers of ventricular specification. during early development (e7.5-8.0), mlc-2v is expressed within the cardiac crescent. the expression pattern of mlc-2v becomes restricted to the ventricular segment of the linear heart tube at e8.0 and remains restricted within the ventricle into adulthood.


== phosphorylation sites and regulators ==
recent studies have highlighted a critical role for mlc2v phosphorylation in cardiac torsion, function and disease. in cardiac muscle, the critical phosphorylation sites have been identified as ser14/ser15 in the mouse heart and ser15 in the human heart. the major kinase responsible for mlc-2v phosphorylation has been identified as cardiac myosin light chain kinase (mlck), encoded for by mylk3. loss of cardiac mlck in mice results in loss of cardiac mlc-2v phosphorylation and cardiac abnormalities.


== clinical significance ==
mutations in myl2 have been associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (fhc). ten fhc mutations have been identified in rlc: e22k, a13t, n47k, p95a, f18l, r58q, ivs6-1g>c, l103e, ivs5-2a>g, d166v. the first three-e22k, a13t and n47k-have been associated with an unusual mid-ventricular chamber obstruction type of hypertrophy. three mutations-r58q, d166v and ivs5-2-are associated with more malignant outcomes, manifesting with sudden cardiac death or at earlier ages. functional studies demonstrate that fhc mutations in rlc affect its ability to both be phosphorylated and to bind calcium/magnesium.


=== effects on cardiac muscle contraction ===
mlc-2v plays an important role in cross-bridge cycling kinetics and cardiac muscle contraction. mlc-2v phosphorylation at ser14 and ser15 increases myosin lever arm stiffness and promotes myosin head diffusion, which altogether slow down myosin kinetics and prolong the duty cycle as a means to fine-tune myofilament ca2+ sensitivity to force.


=== effects on adult cardiac torsion, function and disease ===
a gradient in the levels of both mlc2v phosphorylation and its kinase, cardiac mlck, has been shown to exist across the human heart from endocardium (low phosphorylation) to epicardium (high phosphorylation).  the existence of this gradient has been proposed to impact cardiac torsion due to the relative spatial orientation of endocardial versus epicardial myofibers. in support of this, recent studies have shown that mlc-2v phosphorylation is critical in regulating left ventricular torsion. variations in myosin cycling kinetics and contractile properties as a result of differential mlc-2v phosphorylation (ser14/15) influence both epicardial and endocardial myofiber tension development and recovery to control cardiac torsion and myofiber strain mechanics.a number of human studies have implicated loss of mlc-2v phosphorylation in the pathogenesis of human dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. mlc-2v dephosphorylation has also been reported in human patients carrying a rare form of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (fhc) based on specific mlc-2v and mlck mutations.


== animal studies ==
mlc-2v plays a key role in the regulation of cardiac muscle contraction, through its interactions with myosin. loss of mlc-2v in mice is associated with ultrastructural defects in sarcomere assembly and results in dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, leading to embryonic lethality at e12.5.  more recently, a mutation in zebrafish tell tale heart (telm225) that encodes mlc-2, demonstrated that cardiac mlc-2 is required for thick filament stabilization and contractility in the embryonic zebrafish heart.the role of myl2 mutations in pathogenesis has been determined through the generation of a number of mouse models. transgenic mice overexpressing the human mlc-2v r58q mutation, which is associated with fhc has been shown to lead to a reduction in mlc-2v phosphorylation in hearts. these mice exhibited features of fhc, including diastolic dysfunction that progressed with age. similarly, cardiac overexpression of another fhc-associated mlc-2v mutation (d166v) results in loss of mlc-2v phosphorylation in mouse hearts. in addition to these findings, mlc-2v dephosphorylation in mice results in cardiac dilatation and dysfunction associated with features reminiscent of dilated cardiomyopathy, leading to heart failure and premature death. altogether these studies highlight a role for mlc-2v phosphorylation in adult heart function. these studies also suggest that torsion defects might be an early manifestation of dilated cardiomyopathy consequent to loss of mlc-2v phosphorylation. mlc-2v also plays an important role in cardiac stress associated with hypertrophy. in a novel mlc2v ser14ala/ser15ala knockin mouse model, complete loss of mlc2v (ser14/ser15) phosphorylation led to a worsened and differential (eccentric as opposed to concentric) response to pressure overload-induced hypertrophy. in addition, mice lacking cardiac mlck display heart failure and experience premature death in response to both pressure overload and swimming induced hypertrophy. consistent with these findings, a cardiac-specific transgenic mouse model overexpressing cardiac mlck attenuated the response to cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload. furthermore, in a cardiac-specific transgenic mouse model overexpressing skeletal myosin light chain kinase, the response to cardiac hypertrophy induced by treadmill exercise or isoproterenol was also attenuated. these studies further highlight the therapeutic potential of increasing mlc-2v phosphorylation in settings of cardiac pathological stress.

parks and open spaces in wrexham,non_science,"wrexham has two main town parks, these being bellevue park and acton park, and open parkland at erddig. with the rapid development of the town in the 19th century, the need for a formal park for the growing population was identified. however it was not until 1906 that the location for the new park was agreed upon. the 'parciau' or bellevue park as it became known, was built alongside the old cemetery on ruabon road. the park was designed to commemorate the jubilee year of the incorporation of wrexham.


== parks ==
belle vue park (53.0434°n 2.9997°w﻿ / 53.0434; -2.9997﻿ (belle vue park, wrexham)) was neglected during the 1970s, and many of the amenities were in a poor state of repair. a major project was undertaken to refurbish the park back to its original splendour. this was funded by the heritage lottery fund, urban parks project, welsh development agency, and the european regional development fund. the park reopened in june 2000. it now boasts children's play areas, a bowling green which is home to the parciau bowling club, tennis and basketball courts, an original edwardian bandstand set in an amphitheatre, and a jogging route for walkers and joggers. the park itself has many walkways through mature tree-lined avenues as well as affording some magnificent views of the parish church. the park is well lit and has a number of cctv cameras installed to deter antisocial behaviour.
bellevue park has once again regained its popularity with the people of wrexham. throughout the summer months a broad spectrum of social events take place, such as music concerts for all tastes and 'fun days' for children.

acton park (53.0616°n 2.9795°w﻿ / 53.0616; -2.9795﻿ (acton park, wrexham)) was originally the landscaped grounds of acton hall. it was originally laid out in 1785 by james wyatt on the instructions of the owner sir foster cunliffe. over the years the estate passed through several owners. in 1947 wrexham council was given the hall and park by the then owner alderman william aston. a section of acton park was sold for housing development in the 1970s. the surviving area now covers approximately 55 acres (220,000 m2).
acton park features a bowling green, tennis courts, a children's play area, japanese-style garden and a large lake which has attracted diverse wildlife. the general layout of the park has remained unchanged since it was laid out in the 18th century and now boasts many mature trees.
llwyn isaf (53.0477°n 2.9932°w﻿ / 53.0477; -2.9932﻿ (llwyn isaf, wrexham)), which is situated alongside wrexham guildhall, is a popular green area within the town centre. the green was originally the landscaped grounds of a mansion house known as llwyn isaf. it now lies at the centre of wrexham's civic centre just off queens square. the welsh children in need concert was held at this location in 2005.


== open parkland ==

erddig park (53.0306°n 3.0027°w﻿ / 53.0306; -3.0027﻿ (erddig park, wrexham)) is situated two miles (3 km) south of the town centre, where the town meets the clywedog valley. the park is owned and managed by the national trust, and is home to erddig hall and its formal gardens. the park is also home to a number of notable historic features. these include a hydraulic ram known as the ""cup and saucer"", which is used to pump water from the park to erddig hall, and the remains of wristleham motte and bailey which is thought to be the beginnings of wrexham as a town in the 12th century.


== country parks ==
there are seven country parks located on the outskirts of wrexham, at ty mawr (cefn mawr), alyn waters (gwersyllt), minera leadmines (minera), bonc-y-hafod (hafod), moss valley (moss), nant mill (river clywedog trail) and stryt las (johnstown)."
fibroblast neural crest derived,cell,"in the developing chordate (including vertebrates), the neural tube is the embryonic precursor to the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain and spinal cord. the neural groove gradually deepens as the neural folds become elevated, and ultimately the folds meet and coalesce in the middle line and convert the groove into the closed neural tube. in humans, neural tube closure usually occurs by the fourth week of pregnancy (28th day after conception). the ectodermal wall of the tube forms the rudiment of the nervous system. the centre of the tube is the neural canal.


== development ==

the neural tube develops in two ways: primary neurulation and secondary neurulation.
primary neurulation divides the ectoderm into three cell types:

the internally located neural tube
the externally located epidermis
the neural crest cells, which develop in the region between the neural tube and epidermis but then migrate to new locationsprimary neurulation begins after the neural plate forms. the edges of the neural plate start to thicken and lift upward, forming the neural folds. the center of the neural plate remains grounded, allowing a u-shaped neural groove to form. this neural groove sets the boundary between the right and left sides of the embryo. the neural folds pinch in towards the midline of the embryo and fuse together to form the neural tube.
in secondary neurulation, the cells of the neural plate form a cord-like structure that migrates inside the embryo and hollows to form the tube.each organism uses primary and secondary neurulation to varying degrees.

neurulation in fish proceeds only via the secondary form.
in avian species the posterior regions of the tube develop using secondary neurulation and the anterior regions develop by primary neurulation.
in mammals, secondary neurulation begins around the 35th somite.mammalian neural tubes close in the head in the opposite order that they close in the trunk.

in the head:neural crest cells migrate
neural tube closes
overlying ectoderm closesin the trunk:overlying ectoderm closes
neural tube closes
neural crest cells migrate


== structure ==
four neural tube subdivisions each eventually develop into distinct regions of the central nervous system by the division of neuroepithelial cells: the forebrain (prosencephalon), the midbrain (mesencephalon), the hindbrain (rhombencephalon) and the spinal cord.

the prosencephalon further goes on to develop into the telencephalon (cerebrum) and the diencephalon (the optic vesicles and hypothalamus).
the mesencephalon stays as the midbrain.
the rhombencephalon develops into the metencephalon (the pons and cerebellum) and the myelencephalon (the medulla oblongata).for a short time, the neural tube is open both cranially and caudally. these openings, called neuropores, close during the fourth week in humans. improper closure of the neuropores can result in neural tube defects such as anencephaly or spina bifida.
the dorsal part of the neural tube contains the alar plate, which is associated primarily with sensation. the ventral part of the neural tube contains the basal plate, which is primarily associated with motor (i.e., muscle) control.


== dorsal-ventral patterning ==
the neural tube patterns along the dorsal-ventral axis to establish defined compartments of neural progenitor cells that lead to distinct classes of neurons. according to the french flag model of morphogenesis, this patterning occurs early in development and results from the activity of several secreted signaling molecules. sonic hedgehog (shh) is a key player in patterning the ventral axis, while bone morphogenic proteins (bmps) and wnt family members play an important role in patterning the dorsal axis. other factors shown to provide positional information to the neural progenitor cells include fibroblast growth factors (fgfs) and retinoic acid.  retinoic acid is required ventrally along with shh to induce pax6 and olig2 during differentiation of motor neurons.three main ventral cell types are established during early neural tube development: the floor plate cells, which form at the ventral midline during the neural fold stage; as well as the more dorsally located motor neurons and interneurons. these cell types are specified by the secretion of the shh from the notochord (located ventrally to the neural tube), and later from the floor plate cells. shh acts as a morphogen, meaning that it acts in a concentration-dependent manner to specify cell types as it moves further from its source.the following is a proposed mechanism for how shh patterns the ventral neural tube: a gradient of shh that controls the expression of a group of homeodomain (hd) and basic helix-loop-helix (bhlh) transcription factors is created. these transcription factors are grouped into two protein classes based on how shh affects them. class i is inhibited by shh, whereas class ii is activated by shh. these two classes of proteins then cross-regulate each other to create more-defined boundaries of expression. the different combinations of expression of these transcription factors along the dorsal-ventral axis of the neural tube are responsible for creating the identity of the neuronal progenitor cells. five molecularly distinct groups of ventral neurons form from these neuronal progenitor cells in vitro. also, the position at which these neuronal groups are generated in vivo can be predicted by the concentration of shh required for their induction in vitro. studies have shown that neural progenitors can evoke different responses based on the length of exposure to shh, with a longer exposure time resulting in more ventral cell types.at the dorsal end of the neural tube, bmps are responsible for neuronal patterning. bmp is initially secreted from the overlying ectoderm. a secondary signaling center is then established in the roof plate, the dorsal most structure of the neural tube. bmp from the dorsal end of the neural tube seems to act in the same concentration-dependent manner as shh in the ventral end. this was shown using zebrafish mutants that had varying amounts of bmp signaling activity. researchers observed changes in dorsal-ventral patterning, for example zebrafish deficient in certain bmps showed a loss of dorsal sensory neurons and an expansion of interneurons.

"tg(18:2(9z,12z)/16:0/20:2(11z,14z))[iso6]",reagent,"the itu-t recommendation e.212 defines mobile country codes (mcc) as well as mobile network codes (mnc).


== overview ==
the mobile country code consists of three decimal digits and the mobile network code consists of two or three decimal digits (for example: mnc of 001 is not the same as mnc of 01). the first digit of the mobile country code identifies the geographic region as follows (the digits 1 and 8 are not used):

0: test networks
2: europe
3: north america and the caribbean
4: asia and the middle east
5: australia and oceania
6: africa
7: south and central america
9: worldwide (satellite, air—aboard aircraft, maritime—aboard ships, antarctica)an mcc is used in combination with an mnc (a combination known as an ""mcc/mnc tuple"") to uniquely identify a mobile network operator (carrier) using the gsm (including gsm-r), umts, lte, and 5g public land mobile networks. some but not all cdma, iden, and satellite mobile networks are identified with an mcc/mnc tuple as well. for wimax networks, a globally unique broadband operator id can be derived from the mcc/mnc tuple. tetra networks use the mobile country code from itu-t recommendation e.212 together with a 10-bit binary mobile network code. however, a tetra network may be assigned an e.212 network code as well. some network operators do not have their own radio access network at all. these are called mobile virtual network operators (mvno) and are marked in the tables as such. note that mvnos without their own mcc/mnc (that is, they share the mcc/mnc of their host network) are not listed here.
the following tables attempt to provide a complete list of mobile network operators. country information, including iso 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes is provided for completeness. mostly for historical reasons, one e.212 mcc may correspond to multiple iso country codes (e.g. mcc 362 corresponds to bq, cw, and sx). some operators also choose to use an mcc outside the geographic area that it was assigned to (e.g. digicel uses the jamaica mcc throughout the caribbean). itu-t updates an official list of mobile network codes in its operational bulletins which are published twice a month. itu-t also publishes complete lists: as of january 2019 list issued on 15 december 2018 was current, having all mcc/mnc before 15 december 2018. unfortunately, the official list is often incomplete as national mnc authorities do not forward changes to the itu in a timely manner. the official list does not provide additional details such as bands and technologies and may not list disputed territories such as abkhazia or kosovo.

1h-benzo[de]isoquinoline,reagent,"isoquinoline is a heterocyclic aromatic organic compound. it is a structural isomer of quinoline. isoquinoline and quinoline are benzopyridines, which are composed of a benzene ring fused to a pyridine ring. in a broader sense, the term isoquinoline is used to make reference to isoquinoline derivatives. 1-benzylisoquinoline is the structural backbone in naturally occurring alkaloids including papaverine. the isoquinoline ring in these natural compound derives from the aromatic amino acid tyrosine.


== properties ==
isoquinoline is a colorless hygroscopic liquid at temperatures above its melting point with a penetrating, unpleasant odor. impure samples can appear brownish, as is typical for nitrogen heterocycles. it crystallizes in platelets that have a low solubility in water but dissolve well in ethanol, acetone, diethyl ether, carbon disulfide, and other common organic solvents. it is also soluble in dilute acids as the protonated derivative.
being an analog of pyridine, isoquinoline is a weak base, with a pka of 5.14. it protonates to form salts upon treatment with strong acids, such as hcl. it forms adducts with lewis acids, such as bf3.


== production ==
isoquinoline was first isolated from coal tar in 1885 by hoogewerf and van dorp.  they isolated it by fractional crystallization of the acid sulfate.  weissgerber developed a more rapid route in 1914 by selective extraction of coal tar, exploiting the fact that isoquinoline is more basic than quinoline. isoquinoline can then be isolated from the mixture by fractional crystallization of the acid sulfate.
although isoquinoline derivatives can be synthesized by several methods, relatively few direct methods deliver the unsubstituted isoquinoline.  the pomeranz–fritsch reaction provides an efficient method for the preparation of isoquinoline. this reaction uses a benzaldehyde and aminoacetoaldehyde diethyl acetal, which in an acid medium react to form isoquinoline. alternatively, benzylamine and a glyoxal acetal can be used, to produce the same result using the schlittler-müller modification.
several other methods are useful for the preparation of various isoquinoline derivatives.
in the bischler–napieralski reaction an β-phenylethylamine is acylated and cyclodehydrated by a lewis acid, such as phosphoryl chloride or phosphorus pentoxide. the resulting 1-substituted 3,4-dihydroisoquinoline can then be dehydrogenated using palladium. the following bischler–napieralski reaction produces papaverine.

the pictet–gams reaction and the pictet–spengler reaction are both variations on the bischler–napieralski reaction. a pictet–gams reaction works similarly to the bischler–napieralski reaction; the only difference being that an additional hydroxy group in the reactant provides a site for dehydration under the same reaction conditions as the cyclization to give the isoquinoline rather than requiring a separate reaction to convert a dihydroisoquinoline intermediate.

in a pictet–spengler reaction, a condensation of a β-phenylethylamine and an aldehyde forms an imine, which undergoes a cyclization to form a tetrahydroisoquinoline instead of the dihydroisoquinoline. in enzymology, the (s)-norcoclaurine synthase (ec 4.2.1.78) is an enzyme that catalyzes a biological pictect-spengler synthesis:

 

intramolecular aza wittig reactions also afford isoquinolines.


== applications of derivatives ==
isoquinolines find many applications, including:

anesthetics; dimethisoquin is one example (shown below).

antihypertension agents, such as quinapril and debrisoquine (all derived from 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline).
antiretroviral agents, such as saquinavir with an isoquinolyl functional group, (shown below).

vasodilators, a well-known example, papaverine, shown below.
bisbenzylisoquinolinium compounds are compounds similar in structure to tubocurarine. they have two isoquinolinium structures, linked by a carbon chain, containing two ester linkages.


== in the human body ==
parkinson's disease, a slowly progressing movement disorder, is thought to be caused by certain neurotoxins. a neurotoxin called mptp (1[n]-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), the precursor to mpp+, was found and linked to parkinson's disease in the 1980s. the active neurotoxins destroy dopaminergic neurons, leading to parkinsonism and parkinson's disease. several tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives have been found to have the same neurochemical properties as mptp. these derivatives may act as precursors to active neurotoxins.


== other uses ==
isoquinolines are used in the manufacture of dyes, paints, insecticides and antifungals. it is also used as a solvent for the extraction of resins and terpenes, and as a corrosion inhibitor.

epithelial cell of external acoustic meatus,cell,"earwax, also known by the medical term cerumen, is a brown, orange, red, yellowish or gray waxy substance secreted in the ear canal of humans and other mammals.  it protects the skin of the human ear canal, assists in cleaning and lubrication, and provides protection against bacteria, fungi, and water.earwax consists of dead skin cells, hair, and the secretions of cerumen by the ceruminous and sebaceous glands of the outer ear canal. major components of earwax are long chain fatty acids, both saturated and unsaturated, alcohols, squalene, and cholesterol. excess or compacted cerumen is the buildup of ear wax causing a blockage in the ear canal  and it can press against the eardrum or block the outside ear canal or hearing aids, potentially causing hearing loss.


== physiology ==

cerumen is produced in the outer third of the cartilaginous portion of the ear canal.  it is a mixture of viscous secretions from sebaceous glands and less-viscous ones from modified apocrine sweat glands.  the primary components of earwax are shed layers of skin, with, on average, 60% of the earwax consisting of keratin, 12–20% saturated and unsaturated long-chain fatty acids, alcohols, squalene and 6–9% cholesterol.there are two distinct genetically determined types of earwax: the wet type, which is dominant, and the dry type, which is recessive. while east asians, southeast asians and native americans are more likely to have the dry type of cerumen (gray and flaky), african and european people are more likely to have the wet type (honey-brown, dark orange to dark-brown and moist). 30-50% of south asians, central asians and pacific islanders have the dry type of cerumen. cerumen type has been used by anthropologists to track human migratory patterns, such as those of the inuit. in japan, wet-type earwax is more prevalent among the ainu, in contrast to that country's yamato majority. the wet type earwax differs biochemically from the dry type mainly by its higher concentration of lipid and pigment granules; for example the wet type is 50% lipid while the dry type is only 20%.a specific gene has been identified that determines whether people have wet or dry earwax. the difference in cerumen type has been tracked to a single base change (a single nucleotide polymorphism) in a gene known as ""atp-binding cassette c11 gene"", specifically rs17822931. dry-type individuals are homozygous for adenine whereas wet-type requires at least one guanine. wet-type earwax is associated with armpit odor, which is increased by sweat production. researchers have conjectured that the reduction in sweat or body odor was beneficial to the ancestors of east asians and native americans who are thought to have lived in cold climates.


=== cleaning ===
cleaning of the ear canal occurs as a result of the ""conveyor belt"" process of epithelial migration, aided by jaw movement. cells formed in the centre of the tympanic membrane migrate outwards from the umbo (at a rate comparable to that of fingernail growth) to the walls of the ear canal, and move towards the entrance of the ear canal. the cerumen in the ear canal is also carried outwards, taking with it any particulate matter that may have gathered in the canal. jaw movement assists this process by dislodging debris attached to the walls of the ear canal, increasing the likelihood of its expulsion. removing earwax is in the scope of practice for audiologists and otorhinolaryngologists (ear, nose, and throat) doctors.


=== lubrication ===
the lubrication provided by cerumen prevents desiccation of the skin within the ear canal. the lubricative properties arise from the high lipid content of the sebum produced by the sebaceous glands. in wet-type cerumen, these lipids include cholesterol, squalene, and many long-chain fatty acids and alcohols.


=== antimicrobial effects ===
while studies conducted up until the 1960s found little evidence supporting antibacterial activity for cerumen, more recent studies have found that cerumen has a bactericidal effect on some strains of bacteria. cerumen has been found to reduce the viability of a wide range of bacteria, including haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and many variants of escherichia coli, sometimes by as much as 99%.  the growth of two fungi commonly present in otomycosis was also significantly inhibited by human cerumen. these antimicrobial properties are due principally to the presence of saturated fatty acids, lysozyme and, especially, to the slight acidity of cerumen (ph typically around 6.1 in normal individuals). conversely, other research has found that cerumen can support microbial growth and some cerumen samples were found to have bacterial counts as high as 107/g cerumen. the bacteria were predominantly commensals.


== excess earwax (impacted cerumen) ==
earwax is produced by sebaceous and ceruminous glands in the ear canal,which leads from the outer ear to the eardrum. earwax helps protect the ear by trapping dust and other foreign particles that could filter through and damage the eardrum. normally, earwax moves toward the opening of the ear and falls out or is washed away, but some people's ears produce too much wax. this is referred to as excessive earwax or impacted cerumen.excessive earwax may impede the passage of sound in the ear canal, causing mild conductive hearing loss, pain in the ear, itchiness, or dizziness. untreated impacted wax can result in hearing loss, social withdrawal, poor work function and even mild paranoia. some people with impacted wax present with perforated eardrums; the reason for this is usually self-induced as compacted earwax alone cannot perforate the eardrum, for example due to the use of earbuds. physical exam usually checks for visibility of the tympanic membrane which can be blocked by excessive cerumen.
impacted cerumen may improve on its own, but treatment by a doctor is generally safe and effective. hearing usually returns completely after the impacted earwax is removed. trying to remove impacted cerumen at home with a cotton swab or by ear candling is not recommended, as this may push the cerumen even further into the ear canal causing even more blockage.hearing aids may be associated with increased earwax impaction, as they prevent earwax from being removed from the ear canal, thus causing blockage which leads to it being impacted. it is estimated to be the cause of 60–80% of hearing aid faults. earwax can get into a hearing aid's vents and receivers, and degrades the components inside the hearing aid due to its acidity. excessive earwax can also cause tinnitus, a constant ringing in the ears, ear fullness, hearing loss and ear pain.


== treatment ==
movement of the jaw helps the ears' natural cleaning process. the american academy of otolaryngology discourages earwax removal, unless the excess earwax is causing problems.while a number of methods of earwax removal are effective, their comparative merits have not been determined. a number of softeners are effective; however, if this is not sufficient, the most common method of cerumen removal is syringing with warm water.  a curette method is more likely to be used by audiologists and otolaryngologists when the ear canal is partially occluded and the material is not adhering to the skin of the ear canal. cotton swabs, on the other hand, push most of the earwax farther into the ear canal and remove only a small portion of the top layer of wax that happens to adhere to the fibers of the swab.


=== softeners ===

this process is referred to as cerumenolysis. topical preparations for the removal of earwax may be better than no treatment, and there may not be much difference between types, including water and olive oil. however, there were not enough studies to draw firm conclusions, and the evidence on irrigation and manual removal is equivocal.commercially or commonly available cerumenolytics include:
any of a number of types of oil
urea hydrogen peroxide (6.5%) and glycerine
a solution of sodium bicarbonate in water, or sodium bicarbonate b.p.c. (sodium bicarbonate and glycerine)
cerumol (peanut oil, turpentine and dichlorobenzene)
cerumenex (triethanolamine, polypeptides and oleate-condensate)
docusate, an emulsifying agent, an active ingredient found in laxatives
mineral oila cerumenolytic should be used 2–3 times daily for 3–5 days prior to the cerumen extraction.


=== ear irrigation ===
once the cerumen has been softened, it may be removed from the ear canal by irrigation, but the evidence on this practice is equivocal. this may be effectively accomplished with a spray type ear washer, commonly used in the medical setting or at home, with a bulb syringe. ear syringing techniques are described in great detail by wilson & roeser and blake et al. who advise pulling the external ear up and back, and aiming the nozzle of the syringe slightly upwards and backwards so that the water flows as a cascade along the roof of the canal. the irrigation solution flows out of the canal along its floor, taking wax and debris with it. the solution used to irrigate the ear canal is usually warm water, normal saline, sodium bicarbonate solution, or a solution of water and vinegar to help prevent secondary infection.affected people generally prefer the irrigation solution to be warmed to body temperature, as dizziness is a common side effect of ear washing or syringing with fluids that are colder or warmer than body temperature.


=== curette and cotton swabs ===
earwax can be removed with an ear pick/curette, which physically dislodges the earwax and scoops it out of the ear canal. in the west, use of ear picks is usually only done by health professionals. curetting earwax using an ear pick was common in ancient europe and is still practised in east asia. since the earwax of most asians is of the dry type, it is extremely easily removed by light scraping with an ear pick, as it simply falls out in large pieces or dry flakes.
it is generally advised not to use cotton swabs (q-tips or cotton buds), as doing so will likely push the wax farther down the ear canal, and if used carelessly, perforate the eardrum. abrasion of the ear canal, particularly after water has entered from swimming or bathing, can lead to ear infection. also, the cotton head may fall off and become lodged in the ear canal. therefore, cotton swabs should be used only to clean the external ear.


=== ear candles and vacuuming ===

ear candling, also called ear coning or thermal-auricular therapy, is an alternative medicine practice claimed to improve general health and well-being by lighting one end of a hollow candle and placing the unlit end in the ear canal. it, however, is not recommended as it is both dangerous, ineffective, and counterproductive. advocates say that the dark residue that shows after the procedure consists of extracted earwax, proving the efficacy of the procedure. studies have shown that the same dark residue is left, whether or not the candle (which is made of cotton fabric and beeswax and leaves a residue after burning) is inserted into an ear. this demonstrates that the waxy residue is derived from the candle itself and not the ear. the color of the candle wax matches the light brown-colored wax of the human ear, making the distinction between the two waxes more difficult for a layperson. because the candle itself is a hollow tube, some of the hot burnt wax could drop down inside the candle, into the ear canal, potentially injuring the eardrum. the american academy of otolaryngology states that ear candles are not a safe option for removing ear wax, and that no controlled studies or scientific evidence support their use for ear wax removal. survey responses from medical specialists (otolaryngologists) in the united kingdom reported ear injuries from ear candling including; burns, ear canal occlusions and ear drum perforations and secondary ear canal infections with temporary hearing loss. the food and drug administration has successfully taken several regulatory actions against the sale and distribution of ear candles since 1996, including seizing ear candle products and ordering injunctions.home ""ear vacs"" were ineffective at removing ear-wax, especially when compared to a jobson-horne probe.


=== potential complications ===
a postal survey of british general practitioners found that only 19% always performed cerumen removal themselves. it is problematic as the removal of cerumen is not without risk, and physicians and nurses often have inadequate training for removal. irrigation can be performed at home with proper equipment as long as the person is careful not to irrigate too hard. all other methods should be carried out only by individuals who have been sufficiently trained in the procedure.
the author bull advised physicians: ""after removal of wax, inspect thoroughly to make sure none remains. this advice might seem superfluous, but is frequently ignored."" this was confirmed by sharp et al., who, in a survey of 320 general practitioners, found that only 68% of doctors inspected the ear canal after syringing to check that the wax was removed. as a result, failure to remove the wax from the canal made up approximately 30% of the complications associated with the procedure. other complications included otitis externa (swimmer's ear), which involves inflammation or bacterial infection of the external acoustic meatus, as well as pain, vertigo, tinnitus, and perforation of the ear drum.  based on this study, a rate of major complications in 1/1000 ears syringed was suggested.claims arising from ear syringing mishaps account for about 25% of the total claims received by new zealand's accident compensation corporation ent medical misadventure committee. while high, this is not surprising, as ear syringing is an extremely common procedure.  grossan suggested that approximately 150,000 ears are irrigated each week in the united states, and about 40,000 per week in the united kingdom. extrapolating from data obtained in edinburgh, sharp et al. place this figure much higher, estimating that approximately 7000 ears are syringed per 100,000 population per annum. in the new zealand claims mentioned above, perforation of the tympanic membrane was by far the most common injury resulting in significant disability.


== prevalence ==
the prevalence of impacted earwax is different across the world.
in the united kingdom 2 to 6% of the population have cerumen that is impacted. in america 3.6% of emergency visits caused by ear issues were due to impacted cerumen. in brazil 8.4–13.7% of the population have impacted cerumen.


== history ==

the treatment of excess ear wax was described by aulus cornelius celsus in de medicina in the 1st century:

when a man is becoming dull of hearing, which happens most often after prolonged headaches, in the first place, the ear itself should be inspected: for there will be found either a crust such as comes upon the surface of ulcerations, or concretions of wax. if a crust, hot oil is poured in, or verdigris mixed with honey or leek juice or a little soda in honey wine. and when the crust has been separated from the ulceration, the ear is irrigated with tepid water, to make it easier for the crusts now disengaged to be withdrawn by the ear scoop. if it is wax, and if it is soft, it can be extracted in the same way by the ear scoop; but if hard, vinegar containing a little soda is introduced; and when the wax has softened, the ear is washed out and cleared as above.  ... further, the ear should be syringed with castoreum mixed with vinegar and laurel oil and the juice of young radish rind, or with cucumber juice, mixed with crushed rose leaves. the dropping in of the juice of unripe grapes mixed with rose oil is also fairly efficacious against deafness.


=== uses ===
in medieval times, earwax and other substances such as urine were used to prepare pigments used by scribes to illustrate illuminated manuscripts.
pliny the elder, in his natural history, wrote that earwax—when applied topically—cured bites from humans, scorpions, and serpents; it was said to work best when taken from the ears of a wounded person.
the first lip balm may have been based on earwax. the 1832 edition of the american frugal housewife said that ""nothing was better than earwax to prevent the painful effects resulting from a wound by a nail [or] skewer""; and also recommended earwax as a remedy for cracked lips.
before waxed thread was commonly available, a seamstress would use her own earwax to stop the cut ends of threads from fraying.

many animals have build-ups of earwax, with the most documented on the internet being whales.

imaginal disc cell,cell,"an imaginal disc is one of the parts of a holometabolous insect larva that will become a portion of the outside of the adult insect during the pupal transformation. contained within the body of the larva, there are pairs of discs that will form, for instance, the wings or legs or antennae or other structures in the adult. the role of the imaginal disc in insect development was first elucidated by jan swammerdam.during the pupal stage, many larval structures are broken down, and adult structures, including the discs, undergo rapid development. each disc everts and elongates, with the central portion of the disc becoming the distal part of whichever appendage it is forming: the wing, leg, antenna, etc. during the larval stage, the cells in the growing disc appear undifferentiated, but their developmental fate in the adult is already determined.the experiment that demonstrates this developmental commitment is to take an imaginal disc from a third instar larva, about to undergo pupation, and subdivide it and culture it in the body of a younger larva. discs can be continuously cultured this way for many larval generations. when such a cultured disc is eventually implanted in the body of a larva that is allowed to pupate, the disc will develop into the structure it was originally determined to become. that is, an antenna disc can be cultured this way and will, almost always, become an antenna (out of place, of course) when final development is triggered by pupation.the study of imaginal discs in the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster led to the discovery of homeotic mutations such as antennapedia, where the developmental fate of a disc could sometimes change. it is of interest to entomologists that the kinds of developmental switches that occur are very specific (leg to antenna, for instance). study of this phenomenon led to the discovery of the homeobox genes, and started a revolution in the understanding of development in multi-celled animals.


== imaginal cells ==

imaginal cells are tissue-specific progenitors allocated in embryogenesis that remain quiescent during embryonic and larval life. during drosophila metamorphosis, most larval cells die. pupal and adult tissues form from imaginal cells. clonal analysis and fate mapping of single, identified cells show that tracheal system remodeling at metamorphosis involves a classical imaginal cell population and a population of differentiated, functional larval tracheal cells that reenter the cell cycle and regain developmental potency. in late larvae, both populations are activated and proliferate, spread over and replace old branches, and diversify into various stalk and coiled tracheolar cells under control of fibroblast growth factor signaling. thus, drosophila pupal/adult tissue progenitors can arise both by early allocation of multipotent cells and late return of differentiated cells to a multipotent state, even within a single tissue.

national anthem of honduras,non_science,"the ""national anthem of honduras"" (spanish: himno nacional de honduras) was adopted under presidential decree 42 in 1915. the lyrics were written by augusto constantino coello and the music composed by carlos hartling.
in its entirety, the anthem is a brief chronology of honduran history. the anthem consists of the chorus and seven solos. for official acts, only the chorus and the seventh are sung. the chorus, which is sung before and after the seventh solo, is a description of honduras' chief national symbols, the flag and the coat of arms. the eighth verse, is a patriotic call to duty to hondurans to defend the flag and the nation.
by the time hondurans complete their sixth year of elementary education, they will have memorised and been taught the meaning of all eight stanzas. unofficially, the anthem is sometimes called ""tu bandera es un lampo de cielo"" (spanish for ""your flag is a splendour of sky"") which is also the first line of the chorus. for graduations in middle school, high school, university, or another type of graduation, an exam will be done based on a questionnaire of the national anthem.

namiquipa,non_science,"namiquipa is a town in the mexican state of chihuahua. it serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality of  namiquipa. 
as of 2010, the town of namiquipa had a population of 1,752, up from 1,718 as of 2005.


== history ==
the origin of the settlement is an indigenous village called namiquipa. 
franciscan missionaries established a mission in 1662 or 1663 called san pedro de alcántara de namiquipa. it was subsequently abandoned.namiquipa was refounded and given town (villa) status in 1778. the spanish colonial state established the town and surrounding region as a military colony, and its settlers received land grants in return for fighting apache during the apache wars.namiquipa was a stronghold of pancho villa’s popular movement during much of the mexican revolution of 1910–1920. however, in 1916 locals switched sides and formed local militia that collaborated with the united states. in 1917 namiquipa was attacked by villa and his men, who reportedly raped many townswomen after setting the town ablaze. villa's commander nicolas fernandez managed to take some of the townswomen under his protection, and ordered his soldiers to shoot any one who tried to attack them. after news of the atrocity spread, villa lost the goodwill of many villagers across chihuahua.

sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate,reagent,"sodium thiosulfate (sodium thiosulphate) is an inorganic compound with the formula na2s2o3.xh2o. typically it is available as the white or colorless pentahydrate, na2s2o3·5h2o. the solid is an efflorescent (loses water readily) crystalline substance that dissolves well in water.sodium thiosulfate is used in gold mining, water treatment, analytical chemistry, the development of silver-based photographic film and prints, and medicine.  the medical uses of sodium thiosulfate include treatment of cyanide poisoning and pityriasis. it is on the world health organization's list of essential medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system.


== uses ==


=== medical uses ===

sodium thiosulfate is used in the treatment of cyanide poisoning.  other uses include topical treatment of ringworm and tinea versicolor,  and treating some side effects of hemodialysis and chemotherapy.


=== iodometry ===
in analytical chemistry, the most important use comes because the thiosulfate anion reacts stoichiometrically with iodine in aqueous solution, reducing it to iodide as the thiosulfate is oxidized to tetrathionate:

2 s2o2−3 + i2 → s4o2−6 + 2 i−due to the quantitative nature of this reaction, as well as because na2s2o3·5h2o has an excellent shelf-life, it is used as a titrant in iodometry. na2s2o3·5h2o is also a component of iodine clock experiments.
this particular use can be set up to measure the oxygen content of water through a long series of reactions in the winkler test for dissolved oxygen. it is also used in estimating volumetrically the concentrations of certain compounds in solution (hydrogen peroxide, for instance) and in estimating the chlorine content in commercial bleaching powder and water.


=== photographic processing ===
silver halides, e.g., agbr, typical components of photographic emulsions, dissolve upon treatment with aqueous thiosulfate:

this application as a photographic fixer was discovered by john herschel.  it is used for both film and photographic paper processing; the sodium thiosulfate is known as a photographic fixer, and is often referred to as 'hypo', from the original chemical name, hyposulphite of soda. ammonium thiosulfate is typically preferred to sodium thiosulfate for this application.


=== gold extraction ===
sodium thiosulfate and ammonium thiosulfate are a component of an alternative lixiviants to cyanide for extraction of gold.  thiosulfate forms strong soluble complexes with gold(i) ions, [au(s2o3)2]3−.  the advantages of this approach are that (i) thiosulfate is essentially nontoxic and (ii) that ore types that are refractory to gold cyanidation (e.g. carbonaceous or carlin-type ores) can be leached by thiosulfate.  some problems with this alternative process include the high consumption of thiosulfate, and the lack of a suitable recovery technique, since [au(s2o3)2]3− does not adsorb to activated carbon, which is the standard technique used in gold cyanidation to separate the gold complex from the ore slurry.


=== neutralizing chlorinated water ===
it is used to dechlorinate tap water including lowering chlorine levels for use in aquariums, swimming pools, and spas (e.g., following superchlorination) and within water treatment plants to treat settled backwash water prior to release into rivers.  the reduction reaction is analogous to the iodine reduction reaction.
in ph testing of bleach substances, sodium thiosulfate neutralizes the color-removing effects of bleach and allows one to test the ph of bleach solutions with liquid indicators. the relevant reaction is akin to the iodine reaction: thiosulfate reduces the hypochlorite (active ingredient in bleach) and in so doing becomes oxidized to sulfate. the complete reaction is:

4 naclo + na2s2o3 + 2 naoh → 4 nacl + 2 na2so4 + h2osimilarly, sodium thiosulfate reacts with bromine, removing the free bromine from solution. solutions of sodium thiosulfate are commonly used as a precaution in chemistry laboratories when working with bromine and for the safe disposal of bromine, iodine, or other strong oxidizers.


== structure ==
two polymorphs are known of the pentahydrate.  the anhydrous salt exists in several polymorphs.  in the solid state, the thiosulfate anion is tetrahedral in shape and is notionally derived by replacing one of the oxygen atoms by a sulfur atom in a sulfate anion.  the s-s distance indicates a single bond, implying that the terminal sulfur holds a significant negative charge and the s-o interactions have more double-bond character.


== production ==
on an industrial scale, sodium thiosulfate is produced chiefly from liquid waste products of sodium sulfide or sulfur dye manufacture.in the laboratory, this salt can be prepared by heating an aqueous solution of sodium sulfite with sulfur or by boiling aqueous sodium hydroxide and sulfur according to this equation:
6 naoh + 4 s → 2 na2s + na2s2o3 + 3 h2o


== principal reactions ==
upon heating to 300 °c, it decomposes to sodium sulfate and sodium polysulfide:

4 na2s2o3 → 3 na2so4 + na2s5thiosulfate salts characteristically decompose upon treatment with acids.  initial protonation occurs at sulfur. when the protonation is conducted in diethyl ether at −78 °c, h2s2o3 (thiosulfuric acid) can be obtained. it is a somewhat strong acid with pkas of 0.6 and 1.7 for the first and second dissociations, respectively.
under normal conditions, acidification of solutions of this salt excess with even dilute acids results in complete decomposition to sulfur, sulfur dioxide, and water:
na2s2o3 + 2 hcl → 2 nacl + s + so2 + h2othis reaction is known as a ""clock reaction"", because when the sulfur reaches a certain concentration, the solution turns from colorless to a pale yellow. this reaction has been employed to generate colloidal sulfur.  this process is used to demonstrate the concept of reaction rate in chemistry classes.


=== aluminium cation reaction ===
sodium thiosulfate is used in analytical chemistry. it can, when heated with a sample containing aluminium cations, produce a white precipitate:

2 al3+ + 3 s2o2−3 + 3 h2o → 3 so2 + 3 s + 2 al(oh)3


=== organic chemistry ===
alkylation of sodium thiosulfate gives s-alkylthiosulfates, which are called bunte salts. the alkylthiosulfates are susceptible to hydrolysis, affording the thiol. this reaction is illustrated by one synthesis of thioglycolic acid:

clch2co2h + na2s2o3 → na[o3s2ch2co2h] + nacl
na[o3s2ch2co2h] + h2o → hsch2co2h + nahso4

lateral ventricle glial cell,cell,"the ventricular system is a set of four interconnected cavities known as ventricles in the brain. within each ventricle is a region of choroid plexus which produces the circulating cerebrospinal fluid (csf). the ventricular system is continuous with the central canal of the spinal cord from the fourth ventricle, allowing for the flow of csf to circulate.all of the ventricular system and the central canal of the spinal cord are lined with ependyma, a specialised form of epithelium connected by tight junctions that make up the blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier.


== structure ==

the system comprises four ventricles: 

lateral ventricles right and left (one for each hemisphere)
third ventricle
fourth ventriclethere are several foramina, openings acting as channels, that connect the ventricles. the interventricular foramina (also called the foramina of monro) connect the lateral ventricles to the third ventricle through which the cerebrospinal fluid can flow.


=== ventricles ===

the four cavities of the human brain are called ventricles. the two largest are the lateral ventricles in the cerebrum, the third ventricle is in the diencephalon of the forebrain between the right and left thalamus, and the fourth ventricle is located at the back of the pons and upper half of the medulla oblongata of the hindbrain. the ventricles are concerned with the production and circulation of cerebrospinal fluid


=== development ===
the structures of the ventricular system are embryologically derived from the neural canal, the centre of the neural tube.
as the part of the primitive neural tube that will develop into the brainstem, the neural canal expands dorsally and laterally, creating the fourth ventricle, whereas the neural canal that does not expand and remains the same at the level of the midbrain superior to the fourth ventricle forms the cerebral aqueduct. the fourth ventricle narrows at the obex (in the caudal medulla), to become the central canal of the spinal cord.
in more detail, around the third week of development, the embryo is a three-layered disc. the embryo is covered on the dorsal surface by a layer of cells called ectoderm. in the middle of the dorsal surface of the embryo is a linear structure called the notochord. as the ectoderm proliferates, the notochord is dragged into the middle of the developing embryo.as the brain develops, by the fourth week of embryological development three swellings known as brain vesicles have formed within the embryo around the canal, near where the head will develop. the three primary brain vesicles represent different components of the central nervous system: the prosencephalon, mesencephalon and rhombencephalon. these in turn divide into five secondary vesicles. as these sections develop around the neural canal, the inner neural canal becomes known as primitive ventricles. these form the ventricular system of the brain:  the neural stem cells of the developing brain, principally radial glial cells, line the developing ventricular system in a transient zone called the ventricular zone.
the prosencephalon divides into the telencephalon, which forms the cortex of the developed brain, and the diencephalon. the ventricles contained within the telencephalon become the lateral ventricles, and the ventricles within the diencephalon become the third ventricle.
the rhombencephalon divides into a metencephalon and myelencephalon. the ventricles contained within the rhombencephalon become the fourth ventricle, and the ventricles contained within the mesencephalon become the aqueduct of sylvius.separating the anterior horns of the lateral ventricles is the septum pellucidum: a thin, triangular, vertical membrane which runs as a sheet from the corpus callosum down to the fornix. during the third month of fetal development, a space forms between two septal laminae, known as the cave of septum pellucidum (csp), which is a marker for fetal neural maldevelopment. during the fifth month of development, the laminae start to close and this closure completes from about three to six months after birth. fusion of the septal laminae is attributed to rapid development of the alvei of the hippocampus, amygdala, septal nuclei, fornix, corpus callosum and other midline structures. lack of such limbic development interrupts this posterior-to-anterior fusion, resulting in the continuation of the csp into adulthood.


== function ==


=== flow of cerebrospinal fluid ===

the ventricles are filled with cerebrospinal fluid (csf) which bathes and cushions the brain and spinal cord within their bony confines. csf is produced by modified ependymal cells of the choroid plexus found in all components of the ventricular system except for the cerebral aqueduct and the posterior and anterior horns of the lateral ventricles. csf flows from the lateral ventricles via the interventricular foramina into the third ventricle, and then the fourth ventricle via the cerebral aqueduct in the midbrain. from the fourth ventricle it can pass into the central canal of the spinal cord or into the subarachnoid cisterns via three small foramina: the central median aperture and the two lateral apertures.
the fluid then flows around the superior sagittal sinus to be reabsorbed via the arachnoid granulations  (or arachnoid villi) into the venous sinuses, after which it passes through the jugular vein and major venous system. csf within the spinal cord can flow all the way down to the lumbar cistern at the end of the cord around the cauda equina where lumbar punctures are performed.
the cerebral aqueduct between the third and fourth ventricles is very small, as are the foramina, which means that they can be easily blocked.


=== protection of the brain ===
the brain and spinal cord are covered by the meninges, the three protective membranes of the tough dura mater, the arachnoid mater and the pia mater. the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) within the skull and spine provides further protection and also buoyancy, and is found in the subarachnoid space between the pia mater and the arachnoid mater.
the csf that is produced in the ventricular system is also necessary for chemical stability, and the provision of nutrients needed by the brain. the csf helps to protect the brain from jolts and knocks to the head and also provides buoyancy and support to the brain against gravity. (since the brain and csf are similar in density, the brain floats in neutral buoyancy, suspended in the csf.) this allows the brain to grow in size and weight without resting on the floor of the cranium, which would destroy nervous tissue.


== clinical significance ==
the narrowness of the cerebral aqueduct and foramina means that they can become blocked, for example, by blood following a hemorrhagic stroke. as cerebrospinal fluid is continually produced by the choroid plexus within the ventricles, a blockage of outflow leads to increasingly high pressure in the lateral ventricles. as a consequence, this commonly leads in turn to hydrocephalus. medically one would call this post-haemorrhagic acquired hydrocephalus, but is often referred to colloquially by the layperson as ""water on the brain"". this is an extremely serious condition regardless of the cause of blockage. an endoscopic third ventriculostomy is a surgical procedure for the treatment of hydrocephalus in which an opening is created in the floor of the third ventricle using an endoscope placed within the ventricular system through a burr hole. this allows the cerebrospinal fluid to flow directly to the basal cisterns, thereby bypassing any obstruction. a surgical procedure to make an entry hole to access any of the ventricles is called a ventriculostomy. this is done to drain accumulated cerebrospinal fluid either through a temporary catheter or a permanent shunt.
other diseases of the ventricular system include inflammation of the membranes (meningitis) or of the ventricles (ventriculitis) caused by infection or the introduction of blood following trauma or haemorrhage (cerebral haemorrhage or subarachnoid haemorrhage).
during embryogenesis in the choroid plexus of the ventricles, choroid plexus cysts can form.
the scientific study of ct scans of the ventricles in the late 1970s gave new insight into the study of mental disorders.  researchers found that individuals with schizophrenia had (in terms of group averages) larger than usual ventricles. this became the first ""evidence"" that schizophrenia was biological in origin and led to a renewed interest in its study via the use of imaging techniques. magnetic resonance imaging (mri) has superseded the use of ct in research in the role of detecting ventricular abnormalities in psychiatric illness.
whether the enlarged ventricles is a cause or a result of schizophrenia has not yet been established. enlarged ventricles are also found in organic dementia and have been explained largely in terms of environmental factors. they have also been found to be extremely diverse between individuals, such that the percentage difference in group averages in schizophrenia studies (+16%) has been described as ""not a very profound difference in the context of normal variation"" (ranging from 25% to 350% of the mean average).the cave of septum pellucidum has been loosely associated with schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, as well as with antisocial personality disorder.  csp is one of the distinguishing features of individuals displaying symptoms of dementia pugilistica.

anzco foods,non_science,"anzco foods or simply anzco (formally anzco foods ltd and previously the asian new zealand meat company limited) is a new zealand meat producer fully owned by the japanese company itoham foods, which in turn is part of itoham yonekyu holdings. in 2016, anzco foods was new zealand's fifth-largest exporter, with a turnover of nz$1.5b, and 3,000 employees.


== history ==
anzco started as a company in 1984 under the legal name asian new zealand meat company limited owned through the new zealand meat producers board by individual farmers and led by graeme harrison. in 1989, itoham foods and anzco formed a 50–50 partnership and founded five star beef, a company that operates a feedlot in wakanui near ashburton; this is new zealand's largest feedlot and mainly exports to japan. in 1995, the anzco management team led a buy-out of the company from the meat producers board, with itoham foods taking a 48.3% minority shareholding and another japanese company, nissui (nippon suisan kaisha ltd), taking a smaller shareholding. through that buy-out, the initial investment of nz$350,000 returned over nz$40m to the original owners. anzco foods started operating under the new ownership arrangement on 17 august 1995.in 2015, founder harrison announced that he intended to retire in the near future. this was accompanied by a restructure in shareholding. with approval from the overseas investment office (oio), itoham foods increased its shareholding from 48.3% to 65% and paid just over nz$40m for these transactions. the seven smallest shareholders were all offered to sell. harrison himself sold down from just over 20% to 14%. nissui sold part of its stake at this point (which made up just over 50% of the share transfer) with the balance coming from new zealand shareholders.in late 2017, itoham foods received oio approval to become to sole owner by obtaining the remaining 35% shareholding. nissui held 16.8% at that point, and harrison and other managers held 18.2%. itoham foods is a subsidiary to itoham yonekyu holdings. itoham is publicly listed and 39% owned by the mitsubishi corporation. harrison retired from the company after the march 2018 annual general meeting; he had been at the helm of the company for 34 years, first as managing director and then as chairperson.

the godfather effect,non_science,"the godfather effect is a 2012 critically acclaimed study of the godfather films  – as well as mario puzo's 1969 novel – and their effect on american culture. written by biographer tom santopietro, the book demonstrates how the godfather was a turning point in american cultural consciousness. with its emphasis on proud ethnicity, the godfather changed not just the way italian-americans saw themselves, but how americans of all backgrounds viewed their individual and national self-identities, their possibilities, and attendant disappointments.""the godfather effect"" had a broader philosophical dimension, as well. as noted by santopietro, ""what puzo delivered – brilliantly – was nothing less than a disquisition on the madness, glory, and failure of the american dream."" early in the novel, amerigo bonasera declares ""i believe in america."" the novel then depicts a nation where mafia and big business are two sides of the same coin: both are corrupt, tell the truth selectively, and do exactly as they wish.


== reception ==
the godfather effect was widely reviewed, and well received by the press. the hollywood reporter called it ""a beautiful narrative of the way pop culture shapes our self-image.""the wall street journal declared that ""part memoir, part devotional film essay and part reflection on the meaning of ethnicity in american life, the godfather effect defines how the godfather movies, along with the 1969 mario puzo novel from which they were adapted, reflected the madness, glory and failure of the american dream. by exploring that dream in distinctly italian-american terms, the movies succeeded in delivering nothing less than the italianization of american culture. in other words, they were so cool that everyone wanted to seem a little italian.""newsday appreciated the personal dimension in santopietro's book, noting, ""in the end, it's the personal moments, such as santopietro taking his aging dad to revisit the field where he played baseball as a child, that are most rewarding. the films make up the shell of the godfather effect, but it's the connections with family that give it a center as sweet as cannoli cream.""the new york journal of books found that santopietro ""capably weaves together the memoirist elements, the history, and the analyses of the formal and thematic aspects of the films.""the book was recognized for its historical value by smithsonian magazine, the official publication of the smithsonian institution.

spiramycin,antibiotic,"spiramycin is a macrolide antibiotic and antiparasitic. it is used to treat toxoplasmosis and various other infections of soft tissues. although used in europe, canada and mexico, spiramycin is still considered an experimental drug in the united states, but can sometimes be obtained by special permission from the fda for toxoplasmosis in the first trimester of pregnancy. another treatment option (typically used after 16w gestation) are a combination of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine (given with leucovorin).spiramycin has been used in europe since the year 2000 under the trade name ""rovamycine"", produced by rhone-poulenc rorer, sanofi and famar lyon, france and eczacıbaşı i̇laç, turkey. it also goes under the name rovamycine in canada (distributed by odanlaboratories), where it is mostly marketed to dentists for mouth infections.
spiramycin is a 16-membered ring macrolide. it was isolated in 1954 as a product of streptomyces ambofaciens by pinnert-sindico. as a preparation for oral administration it has been used since 1955, in 1987 also the parenteral form was introduced into practice. the antibiotic action involves inhibition of protein synthesis in the bacterial cell during translocation. resistance to spiramycin can develop by several mechanisms and its prevalence is to a considerable extent proportional to the frequency of prescription in a given area. the antibacterial spectrum comprises gram-positive cocci and rods, gram-negative cocci and also legionellae, mycoplasmas, chlamydiae, some types of spirochetes, toxoplasma gondii and cryptosporidium species. enterobacteria, pseudomonads and pathogenic moulds are resistant. its action is mainly bacteriostatic, on highly sensitive strains it exerts a bactericide action. as compared with erythromycin, it is in vitro weight for weight 5 to 20 less effective, an equipotential therapeutic dose is, however, only double. this difference between the effectiveness in vitro and in vivo is explained above all by the great affinity of spiramycin to tissues where it achieves concentrations many times higher than serum levels. an important part is played also by the slow release of the antibiotic from the tissue compartment, the marked action on microbes in sub-inhibition concentrations and the relatively long persisting post-antibiotic effect. its great advantage is the exceptionally favourable tolerance-gastrointestinal and general. it is available for parenteral and oral administration

minocycline,antibiotic,"minocycline, sold under the brand name minocin among others, is a tetracycline antibiotic used to treat a number of bacterial infections such as pneumonia. it is generally less preferred than the tetracycline doxycycline. it is also used for the treatment of acne and rheumatoid arthritis. it is taken by mouth or applied to the skin.common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, allergic reactions, and kidney problems. serious side effects may include anaphylaxis, a lupus-like syndrome, and easy sunburning. use in the later part of pregnancy may harm the baby and safety during breastfeeding is unclear. it works by decreasing a bacterium's ability to make protein thus stopping its growth.minocycline was patented in 1961 and came into commercial use in 1971. it is available as a generic medication. in 2017, it was the 237th most commonly prescribed medication in the united states, with more than two million prescriptions.


== medical uses ==


=== acne ===
minocycline and doxycycline are frequently used for the treatment of acne vulgaris. both of these closely related antibiotics have similar levels of efficacy, although doxycycline has a slightly lower risk of adverse side effects. historically, minocycline has been an effective treatment for acne vulgaris. however, acne that is caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a growing problem in many countries. in europe and north america, a number of people with acne no longer respond well to treatment with tetracycline family antibiotics because their acne symptoms are caused by bacteria (primarily cutibacterium acnes) that are resistant to these antibiotics. in order to reduce resistance rates as well as increase the effectiveness of treatment, oral antibiotics should be generally combined with topical acne creams such as benzoyl peroxide or a retinoid (tretinoin, adapalene, etc.). minocycline itself is used both orally and topically in the treatment of acne.


=== infections ===
minocycline is also used for other skin infections such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus as well as lyme disease, as the one pill twice daily 100-mg dosage is far easier for patients than the four times a day required with tetracycline or oxytetracycline. its superior ability to cross the blood-brain barrier adds to its effectiveness against lyme disease.
although minocycline's broader spectrum of activity, compared with other members of the group, includes activity against neisseria meningitidis, its use for prophylaxis is no longer recommended because of side effects (dizziness and vertigo).
it may be used to treat certain strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus infection and a disease caused by drug-resistant acinetobacter spp.a list of uses includes:

amoebic dysentery
anthrax
bubonic plague
cholera
ehrlichiosis

both minocycline and doxycycline have shown effectiveness in asthma due to immune-suppressing effects. minocycline and doxycycline have modest effectiveness in treating rheumatoid arthritis. however, the 2015 american college of rheumatology guideline for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis does not include minocycline.
recent research indicate that centrally infused minocycline attenuates brain microglial activation, neuroinflammation and sympathetic activation during pulmonary hypertension 


== contraindications ==
the drug is contraindicated in people with known hypersensitivity to tetracycline antibiotics, as there is complete cross sensitivity in this group. it is also contraindicated in people with severe liver impairment and after the 16th week of pregnancy.


== side effects ==

minocycline may cause upset stomach, diarrhea, dizziness, unsteadiness, drowsiness, mouth sores, headache, and vomiting. it increases sensitivity to sunlight, and may affect the quality of sleep and rarely causes sleep disorders. it has also been linked to cases of lupus. prolonged use of minocycline  can lead to blue-gray staining of skin, fingernails, and  scar tissue. this staining is not permanent, but can take a very long time for the skin color to return to normal; however, a muddy brown skin color in sun-exposed areas is usually permanent. permanent blue discoloration of gums or teeth discoloration may also occur. rare but serious side effects include fever, yellowing of the eyes or skin, stomach pain, sore throat, vision changes, and mental changes, including depersonalization.occasionally, minocycline therapy may result in autoimmune disorders such as drug-related lupus and autoimmune hepatitis, which usually occurs in men who also developed minocycline-induced lupus; however, women are more likely to develop minocycline-induced lupus. significant or complete recovery occurs in most people who develop minocycline-induced autoimmune problems within a period of a few weeks to a year of cessation of minocycline therapy. autoimmune problems emerge during chronic therapy, but can sometimes occur after only short courses of a couple of weeks of therapy. drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms  syndrome can occur during the first few weeks of therapy with minocycline.minocycline, but not other tetracyclines, can cause vestibular disturbances with dizziness, ataxia, vertigo, and tinnitus. these effects are thought to be related to minocycline's greater penetration into the central nervous system. vestibular side effects are much more common in women than in men, occurring in 50 to 70% of women receiving minocycline. as a result of the frequency of this bothersome side effect, minocycline is rarely used in female patients.symptoms of an allergic reaction include rash, itching, swelling, severe dizziness, and trouble breathing. minocycline has also been reported to very rarely cause idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), a side effect also more common in female patients, potentially leading to permanent vision damage if not recognized early and treated.
contrary to most other tetracycline antibiotics (doxycycline excluded), minocycline may be used in those with kidney disease, but may aggravate systemic lupus erythematosus. it may also trigger or unmask autoimmune hepatitis.minocycline can cause the rare condition of secondary intracranial hypertension, which has initial symptoms of headache, visual disturbances, dizziness, vomiting, and confusion. brain swelling and rheumatoid arthritis are rare side effects of minocycline in some people.minocycline, like most tetracyclines, becomes dangerous past its expiration date. while most prescription drugs lose potency after their expiration dates, tetracyclines are known to become toxic over time. expired tetracyclines can cause serious damage to the kidney due to the formation of a degradation product, anhydro-4-epitetracycline.
minocycline's absorption is impaired if taken at the same time of day as calcium or iron supplements. unlike some of the other tetracycline group antibiotics, it can be taken with calcium-rich foods such as milk, although this does reduce the absorption slightly.minocycline, like other tetracyclines, is associated with esophageal irritation and ulceration if insufficient fluids are taken with the drug before sleep.a 2007 study suggested that minocycline harms amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients. patients on minocycline declined more rapidly than those on placebo. the mechanism of this side effect is unknown, although a hypothesis is that the drug exacerbated an autoimmune component of the primary disease. the effect does not seem to be dose-dependent because the patients on high doses did not do worse than those on the low doses.


== interactions ==
the combination of minocycline with dairy, antacids, calcium and magnesium supplements, iron products, laxatives containing magnesium, or bile acid sequestrants may decrease doxycycline's effectiveness by forming chelates. combining it with isotretinoin, acitretin or other retinoids can increase the risk for intracranial hypertension. minocycline significantly reduces concentrations of the anti-hiv drug atazanavir in the body.


== pharmacology ==


=== mechanism of action ===


=== pharmacokinetics ===
minocycline is quickly and nearly completely absorbed from the upper part of the small intestine. taking it together with food, including milk, has no relevant influence on resorption. it reaches highest blood plasma concentrations after one to two hours and has a plasma protein binding of 70–75%. the substance penetrates into almost all tissues; very high concentrations are found in the gallbladder and liver. it crosses the blood–brain barrier better than doxycycline and other tetracyclines, reaching therapeutically relevant concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid and also in inflamed meninges.minocycline is inactivated by metabolization in the liver to about 50%. the rest is predominantly excreted into the gut (in part via the gallbladder, in part directly from blood vessels) and eliminated via the feces. about 10–15% are eliminated via the kidneys. the biological half-life is 14–22 (11–26) hours in healthy people, up to 30 hours in those with kidney failure, and significantly longer in those with liver disease.


== chemistry ==
the drug is used in form of minocycline hydrochloride dihydrate, which is sparingly soluble in water and slightly soluble in ethanol. minocycline reacts acidic in aqueous solution.


== history ==
minocycline was patented in 1961 and came into commercial use in 1971. a topical foam for treatment of acne was approved in 2019.


== society and culture ==


=== trade names ===
many forms of minocycline are no longer covered by patent, so it is marketed under a variety of trade names:

minomycin
minostad (in europe, for the treatment of acne)
akamin
minocin
minoderm
cyclimycin
arestin (1-mg doses administered locally into periodontal pockets, after scaling and root planing, for treatment of periodontal disease.)

divaine (in india)
dentomycin  (2% minocylcine gel for use in periodontal pockets)stonebridge pharma also markets minocycline as cleeravue-m in combination with sterilid eyelid cleanser in the treatment of rosacea blepharitis.


=== society and culture ===
it is available as a generic medication.


== research ==
early research has found a tentative benefit from minocycline in schizophrenia, with several trials underway. a 2014 meta-analysis found minocycline may reduce negative and total symptom scores and was well tolerated.current research is examining the possible neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of minocycline against the progression of a group of neurodegenerative disorders including multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, huntington's disease, and parkinson's disease. as mentioned above, minocycline harms als patients.
minocycline is also known to indirectly inhibit inducible nitric oxide synthase.a trial found no difference between minocycline and placebo in people with alzheimers' disease. minocycline also has been used as a ""last-ditch"" treatment for toxoplasmosis in aids patients. minocycline is somewhat neuroprotective in mouse models of huntington's disease.a 2007 study reported the impact of the antibiotic minocycline on clinical and magnetic resonance imaging  (mri) outcomes and serum immune molecules in 40 ms patients over 24 months of open-label minocycline treatment. despite a moderately high pretreatment relapse rate in the patient group prior to treatment (1.3/year pre-enrollment; 1.2/year during a three-month baseline period), no relapses occurred between months 6 and 24 on minocycline. also, despite significant mri disease-activity pretreatment (19/40 scans had gadolinium-enhancing activity during a three-month run-in), the only patient with gadolinium-enhancing lesions on mri at 12 and 24 months was on half-dose minocycline. levels of interleukin-12 (il-12), which at high levels might antagonize the proinflammatory il-12 receptor, were elevated over 18 months of treatment, as were levels of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (vcam-1). the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 was decreased by treatment. clinical and mri outcomes in this study were supported by systemic immunological changes and call for further investigation of minocycline in ms.the overall antidepressant effect size of minocycline compared to placebo in a meta-analysis was -0.78, indicative of a potential antidepressant effect.in ongoing research and trial minocycline demonstrated efficacy and seems a promising neuroprotective agent in acute stroke patients, especially in ais subgroup. further rcts are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of minocycline among ich patients.

ammonium chloride oral powder,drug,"ammonium chloride is an inorganic compound with the formula nh4cl and a white crystalline salt that is highly soluble in water. solutions of ammonium chloride are mildly acidic. sal ammoniac is a name of the natural, mineralogical form of ammonium chloride. the mineral is commonly formed on burning coal dumps from condensation of coal-derived gases. it is also found around some types of volcanic vents. it is mainly used as fertilizer and a flavouring agent in some types of liquorice. it is the product from the reaction of hydrochloric acid and ammonia.


== production ==

it is a product of the solvay process used to produce sodium carbonate:
co2 + 2 nh3 + 2 nacl + h2o → 2 nh4cl + na2co3in addition to being the principal method for the manufacture of ammonium chloride, that method is used to minimize ammonia release in some industrial operations.
ammonium chloride is prepared commercially by combining ammonia (nh3) with either hydrogen chloride (gas) or hydrochloric acid (water solution):
nh3 + hcl → nh4clammonium chloride occurs naturally in volcanic regions, forming on volcanic rocks near fume-releasing vents (fumaroles). the crystals deposit directly from the gaseous state and tend to be short-lived, as they dissolve easily in water.


== reactions ==

ammonium chloride appears to sublime upon heating but actually decomposes into ammonia and hydrogen chloride gas.
nh4cl → nh3 + hcl
ammonium chloride reacts with a strong base, like sodium hydroxide, to release ammonia gas:

nh4cl + naoh → nh3 + nacl + h2osimilarly, ammonium chloride also reacts with alkali metal carbonates at elevated temperatures, giving ammonia and alkali metal chloride:

2 nh4cl + na2co3 → 2 nacl + co2 + h2o + 2 nh3a 5% by weight solution of ammonium chloride in water has a ph in the range 4.6 to 6.0.some of ammonium chloride's reactions with other chemicals are endothermic like its reaction with barium hydroxide and its dissolving in water.


== applications ==

the dominant application of ammonium chloride is as a nitrogen source in fertilizers (corresponding to 90% of the world production of ammonium chloride) such as chloroammonium phosphate. the main crops fertilized this way are rice and wheat in asia.ammonium chloride was used in pyrotechnics in the 18th century but was superseded by safer and less hygroscopic chemicals. its purpose was to provide a chlorine donor to enhance the green and blue colours from copper ions in the flame.
it had a secondary use to provide white smoke, but its ready double decomposition reaction with potassium chlorate producing the highly unstable ammonium chlorate made its use very dangerous.


=== metalwork ===
ammonium chloride is used as a flux in preparing metals to be tin coated, galvanized or soldered. it works as a flux by cleaning the surface of workpieces by reacting with the metal oxides at the surface to form a volatile metal chloride. for that purpose, it is sold in blocks at hardware stores for use in cleaning the tip of a soldering iron, and it can also be included in solder as flux.


=== medicine ===
ammonium chloride is used as an expectorant in cough medicine. its expectorant action is caused by irritative action on the bronchial mucosa, which causes the production of excess respiratory tract fluid, which presumably is easier to cough up. ammonium salts are an irritant to the gastric mucosa and may induce nausea and vomiting.

amonia nitrate nh3no3
nh3+ no3 = nh3no3 
boiling point :- 56

ammonium chloride is used as a systemic acidifying agent in treatment of severe metabolic alkalosis, in oral acid loading test to diagnose distal renal tubular acidosis, to maintain the urine at an acid ph in the treatment of some urinary-tract disorders.


=== food ===
ammonium chloride, under the name sal ammoniac or salmiak is used as food additive under the e number e510, working as a yeast nutrient in breadmaking and as an acidifier. it is a feed supplement for cattle and an ingredient in nutritive media for yeasts and many microorganisms.
ammonium chloride is used to spice up dark sweets called salty liquorice (popular in scandinavia), in baking to give cookies a very crisp texture, and in the liquor salmiakki koskenkorva for flavouring. in iran, tajikistan, india, pakistan and arab countries it is called ""noshader"" and is used to improve the crispness of snacks such as samosas and jalebi.


=== in the laboratory ===
ammonium chloride has been used historically to produce low temperatures in cooling baths.  ammonium chloride solutions with ammonia are used as buffer solutions including ack (ammonium-chloride-potassium) lysis buffer.in paleontology, ammonium chloride vapor is deposited on fossils, where the substance forms a brilliant white, easily removed and fairly harmless and inert layer of tiny crystals. that covers up any coloration the fossil may have, and if lighted at an angle highly enhances contrast in photographic documentation of three-dimensional specimens. the same technique is applied in archaeology to eliminate reflection on glass and similar specimens for photography.
in organic synthesis saturated nh4cl solution is typically used to quench reaction mixtures.


=== flotation ===
giant squid and some other large squid species maintain neutral buoyancy in seawater through an ammonium chloride solution which is found throughout their bodies and is less dense than seawater. this differs from the method of flotation used by most fish, which involves a gas-filled swim bladder.


=== batteries ===
around the turn of the 20th century, ammonium chloride was used in aqueous solution as the electrolyte in leclanché cells that found a commercial use as the ""local battery"" in subscribers' telephone installations. those cells later evolved into zinc–carbon batteries still using ammonium chloride as electrolyte.


=== other applications ===
ammonium chloride is used in a ~5% aqueous solution to work on oil wells with clay swelling problems. other uses include in hair shampoo, in the glue that bonds plywood, and in cleaning products. in hair shampoo, it is used as a thickening agent in ammonium-based surfactant systems such as ammonium lauryl sulfate. ammonium chloride is used in the textile and leather industry, in dyeing, tanning, textile printing and cotton clustering. in woodworking, a solution of ammonium chloride and water, when applied to unfinished wood, will burn when subjected to a heat gun resulting in a branding iron mark without use of a branding iron. the solution can be painted onto the wood or applied with a common rubber stamp.


== history ==
the earliest mention of ammonium chloride was in 554 a.d. in china.  at that time, ammonium chloride came from two sources:  (1) the vents of underground coal fires in central asia, specifically, in the tian shan mountains (which extend from xinjiang province of northwestern china through kyrgyzstan) as well as in the alay (or alai) mountains of southwestern kyrgyzstan, and (2) the fumaroles of the volcano mount taftan in southeastern iran.  (indeed, the word for ammonium chloride in several asian languages derives from the iranian phrase anosh adur (immortal fire), a reference to the underground fires.)  ammonium chloride was then transported along the silk road eastwards to china and westwards to the muslim lands and europe.
around 800 a.d. the arabs of egypt discovered ammonium chloride in the soot that resulted from burning camel dung, and this source became an alternative to those in central asia.

mv camilla desgagnés,non_science,"mv camilla d is a st kitts and nevis cargo vessel that has operated since 2003 in the waters of eastern and arctic canada. before that, the ship was sailing under the finnish flag as ms camilla, owned by lundqvist rederierna of mariehamn, åland islands. the ship was built by krögerwerft gmbh in rendsburg, west germany in 1982. as the ship operated out of finnish and baltic ports in winter mainly without icebreaker assistance, she has the highest finnish-swedish ice class of 1a super.


== 2003 salvage ==
on may 1, 2002, camilla was laid up in the port of mariehamn, finland. according to the finnish investigation report, maintenance work on the ship was intended to be carried out during the lay-up, but did not actually take place. on december 31, 2002 the ship departed mariehamn for canada in ballast for a cargo of paper. during the sailing, it was noticed that the ship's fuel had been contaminated with water, requiring a transition to burning light oil, and that engine lubrication oil required continuous filtering. the exhaust valves of the main engine also saw attention many times during the trip. after loading her cargo in dalhousie, new brunswick, canada, the ship left for england on january 19, 2003. on jan 23rd 05:40z the main engine stopped at sea, causing a black out. the engine failed with alarms and was restarted several times each time with some increasingly worrying signs of disrepair. at 09:36z it was discovered that one of the crank shaft bearings was overheating with mechanical noise emerging from several of the cylinders. at 10:45z the engine was declared inoperative. the engineers initially set out to repair the engine, but the master's decision at 13.48z that the ship would be evacuated halted the work. a hurricane was closing in, the repairs would take up to 36 hours, and even in the best case the ship's propulsion would be limited. the ship was then at 46°54.7′n 46°50.9′w and rolling 30-40 degrees. the crew ate dinner, closed all the hatches and valves and prepared to leave the ship. the ship's stork-werkspoor engine type was deemed in the finnish investigation report to be very sensitive to the quality of its lubrication oil owing to a design feature, and the type had also received a general design revision to the crank rod bearings and the connecting rods. the engine type was also known to collect sticky oily residue in the general crankshaft area even when carefully maintained. the engine on board camilla had both unrevised and revised parts installed, but the parts to fail were all of the unrevised design. the investigation board concluded that the most probable cause for the engine break down was imperfect lubrication of the main engine. the imperfect lubrication was a result of several factors, as detailed in the full report.
camilla was abandoned after her 17-person crew was rescued from the ship by the canadian coast guard and the canadian forces in january 2003 off newfoundland following extreme weather.  this rescue became the subject of an installment of the 2007 national geographic channel documentary series trapped.
titan salvage partnered with international transport contractors to salvage camilla.  itc tugboat kigoria and secunda marine tugboat ryan leet secured the vessel on january 30, 2003 while camilla was heeling 20 degrees to port and rolling 40 degrees to port.  the vessel was towed to sheltered waters on the newfoundland coast before being moved to st. john's for delivery to her owners.
the ship was sold at that time to groupe desgagnés of quebec who renamed her camilla desgagnés.


== 2005 fire ==
on june 8, 2005 the vessel reported an engine room fire off new york city.  disabled, the owners contracted titan salvage who had originally salvaged the vessel in 2003.  the vessel's crew contained the fire and titan salvage sub-contracted mcallister towing to move the camilla desgagnés to port elizabeth, new jersey where it was safely returned to the owners on june 10, 2005.


== 2008 transit of the northwest passage ==

camilla desgagnés was claimed to have become the first commercial vessel to transit the northwest passage in september 2008. however, she has been preceded at least by ss manhattan, an oil tanker retrofitted with an icebreaker bow for the transit, in 1969 and in 1970.on november 28, 2008, the canadian broadcasting corporation reported that the canadian coast guard confirmed the first commercial ship sailed through the northwest passage. in september 2008, mv camilla desgagnés, owned by desgagnés transarctik inc. and, along with the arctic cooperative, is part of nunavut sealift and supply incorporated (nssi), transported cargo from montreal to the hamlets of cambridge bay, kugluktuk, gjoa haven and taloyoak. a member of the crew is reported to have claimed that ""there was no ice whatsoever"". shipping from the east is to resume in the fall of 2009. although sealift is an annual feature of the canadian arctic this is the first time that the western communities have been serviced from the east. the western portion of the canadian arctic is normally supplied by northern transportation company limited (ntcl) from hay river. the eastern portion by nnsi and ntcl from churchill and montreal.

glycerin medicated liquid soap,drug,"soap is a salt of a fatty acid used in a variety of cleansing and lubricating products. in a domestic setting, soaps are surfactants usually used for washing, bathing, and other types of housekeeping. in industrial settings, soaps are used as thickeners, components of some lubricants, and precursors to catalysts.
when used for cleaning, soap solubilizes particles and grime, which can then be separated from the article being cleaned. in hand washing, as a surfactant, when lathered with a little water, soap kills microorganisms by disorganizing their membrane lipid bilayer and denaturing their proteins. it also emulsifies oils, enabling them to be carried away by running water.soap is created by mixing fats and oils with a base, as opposed to detergent which is created by combining chemical compounds in a mixer.
humans have used soap for millennia. evidence exists of the production of soap-like materials in around 2800 bc in ancient babylon.


== types of soaps ==

since they are salts of fatty acids, soaps have the general formula (rco2−)nmn+ (where r is an alkyl, m is a metal and n is the charge of the cation). the major classification of soaps is determined by the identity of mn+. when m is na or k, the soaps are called toilet soaps, used for handwashing. many metal dications (mg2+, ca2+, and others) give metallic soap. when m is li, the result is lithium soap (e.g., lithium stearate), which is used in high-performance greases.


=== non-toilet soaps ===
soaps are key components of most lubricating greases and thickeners.  greases are usually emulsions of calcium soap or lithium soap and mineral oil. many other metallic soaps are also useful, including those of aluminium, sodium, and mixtures thereof. such soaps are also used as thickeners to increase the viscosity of oils. in ancient times, lubricating greases were made by the addition of lime to olive oil.metal soaps are also included in modern artists' oil paints formulations as a rheology modifier.


==== production of metallic soaps ====
most metal soaps are prepared by neutralization of purified fatty acids:

2 rco2h  +  cao   →   (rco2)2ca  +  h2o


=== toilet soaps ===
in a domestic setting, ""soap"" usually refers to what is technically called a toilet soap, used for household and personal cleaning. when used for cleaning, soap solubilizes particles and grime, which can then be separated from the article being cleaned.
the insoluble oil/fat molecules become associated inside micelles, tiny spheres formed from soap molecules with polar hydrophilic (water-attracting) groups on the outside and encasing a lipophilic (fat-attracting) pocket, which shields the oil/fat molecules from the water making it soluble. anything that is soluble will be washed away with the water.


==== production of toilet soaps ====
the production of toilet soaps usually entails saponification of triglycerides, which are vegetable or animal oils and fats.  an alkaline solution (often lye or sodium hydroxide) induces saponification whereby the triglyceride fats first hydrolyze into salts of fatty acids. glycerol (glycerin) is liberated. the glycerin can remain in the soap product as a softening agent, although it is sometimes separated.the type of alkali metal used determines the kind of soap product. sodium soaps, prepared from sodium hydroxide, are firm, whereas potassium soaps, derived from potassium hydroxide, are softer or often liquid. historically, potassium hydroxide was extracted from the ashes of bracken or other plants. lithium soaps also tend to be hard. these are used exclusively in greases.
for making toilet soaps, triglycerides (oils and fats) are derived from coconut, olive, or palm oils, as well as tallow. triglyceride is the chemical name for the triesters of fatty acids and glycerin. tallow, i.e., rendered beef fat, is the most available triglyceride from animals. each species offers quite different fatty acid content, resulting in soaps of distinct feel. the seed oils give softer but milder soaps. soap made from pure olive oil, sometimes called castile soap or marseille soap, is reputed for its particular mildness. the term ""castile"" is also sometimes applied to soaps from a mixture of oils, but a high percentage of olive oil.


== history ==


=== ancient middle east ===

the earliest recorded evidence of the production of soap-like materials dates back to around 2800 bc in ancient babylon.  a formula for soap consisting of water, alkali, and cassia oil was written on a babylonian clay tablet around 2200 bc.the ebers papyrus (egypt, 1550 bc) indicates the ancient egyptians bathed regularly and combined animal and vegetable oils with alkaline salts to create a soap-like substance. egyptian documents mention a similar substance was used in the preparation of wool for weaving.in the reign of nabonidus (556–539 bc), a recipe for soap consisted of uhulu [ashes], cypress [oil] and sesame [seed oil] ""for washing the stones for the servant girls"".in ancient palestine, the ashes from barilla plants, such as species of salsola, saltwort (seidlitzia rosmarinus) and anabasis, were used in soap production, known as potash. soap made from potash (a concentrate of burnt wood or vegetable ashes mixed with lard or olive oil) is alkaline. if animal lard were used, it was heated and kept lukewarm (not boiling hot; neither cold). lard, collected from suet, needed to be rendered and strained before being used with ashes (with the recommended consistency of 1 cup of lard to 3/8 cup of concentrated ash water). traditionally, olive oil was used instead of animal lard throughout the levant, which was boiled in a copper cauldron for several days. as the boiling progresses, alkali ashes and smaller quantities of quicklime were added, and constantly stirred. in the case of lard, it required constant stirring while kept lukewarm until it began to trace. once it began to thicken, the brew was poured into a mold and left to cool and harden for 2 weeks. after hardening, it was cut into smaller cakes. aromatic herbs were often added to the rendered soap to impart their fragrance, such as yarrow leaves, lavender, germander, etc. the ancient method here described is still in use in the production of nabulsi soap.


=== roman empire ===
the word sapo, latin for soap, likely was borrowed from an early germanic language and is cognate with latin sebum, ""tallow"". it first appears in pliny the elder's account, historia naturalis, which discusses the manufacture of soap from tallow and ashes, but the only use he mentions for it is as a pomade for hair; he mentions rather disapprovingly that the men of the gauls and germans were more likely to use it than their female counterparts. the romans avoided washing with harsh soaps before encountering the milder soaps used by the gauls around 58 bc. aretaeus of cappadocia, writing in the 2nd century ad, observes among ""celts, which are men called gauls, those alkaline substances that are made into balls [...] called soap"". the romans' preferred method of cleaning the body was to massage oil into the skin and then scrape away both the oil and any dirt with a strigil. the gauls used soap made from animal fat.
zosimos of panopolis, circa 300 ad, describes soap and soapmaking. galen describes soap-making using lye and prescribes washing to carry away impurities from the body and clothes. the use of soap for personal cleanliness became increasingly common in the 2nd century ad. according to galen, the best soaps were germanic, and soaps from gaul were second best.


=== ancient china ===
a detergent similar to soap was manufactured in ancient china from the seeds of gleditsia sinensis. another traditional detergent is a mixture of pig pancreas and plant ash called zhuyizi (simplified chinese: 猪胰子; traditional chinese: 豬胰子; pinyin: zhūyízǐ). true soap, made of animal fat, did not appear in china until the modern era. soap-like detergents were not as popular as ointments and creams.


=== islamic middle east ===
hard toilet soap with a pleasant smell was produced in the middle east during the islamic golden age, when soap-making became an established industry. recipes for soap-making are described by muhammad ibn zakariya al-razi (854–925), who also gave a recipe for producing glycerine from olive oil. in the middle east, soap was produced from the interaction of fatty oils and fats with alkali. in syria, soap was produced using olive oil together with alkali and lime. soap was exported from syria to other parts of the muslim world and to europe.a 12th-century islamic document describes the process of soap production.  it mentions the key ingredient, alkali, which later becomes crucial to modern chemistry, derived from al-qaly or ""ashes"".
by the 13th century, the manufacture of soap in the islamic world had become virtually industrialized, with sources in nablus, fes, damascus, and aleppo.


=== medieval europe ===

soapmakers in naples were members of a guild in the late sixth century (then under the control of the eastern roman empire), and in the eighth century, soap-making was well known in italy and spain. the carolingian capitulary de villis, dating to around 800, representing the royal will of charlemagne, mentions soap as being one of the products the stewards of royal estates are to tally. the lands of medieval spain were a leading soapmaker by 800, and soapmaking began in the kingdom of england about 1200. soapmaking is mentioned both as ""women's work"" and as the produce of ""good workmen"" alongside other necessities, such as the produce of carpenters, blacksmiths, and bakers.in europe, soap in the 9th century was produced from animal fats and had an unpleasant smell. hard toilet soap with a pleasant smell was later imported from the middle east. by the 15th century, the manufacture of soap in the christendom had become virtually industrialized, with sources in antwerp, castile, marseille, naples and venice.


=== 15th–18th centuries ===

in france, by the second half of the 15th century, the semi-industrialized professional manufacture of soap was concentrated in a few centers of provence—toulon, hyères, and marseille—which supplied the rest of france. in marseilles, by 1525, production was concentrated in at least two factories, and soap production at marseille tended to eclipse the other provençal centers. english manufacture tended to concentrate in london.finer soaps were later produced in europe from the 16th century, using vegetable oils (such as olive oil) as opposed to animal fats. many of these soaps are still produced, both industrially and by small-scale artisans. castile soap is a popular example of the vegetable-only soaps derived from the oldest ""white soap"" of italy. in 1634 charles i granted the newly formed society of soapmakers a monopoly in soap production who produced certificates from ‘foure countesses, and five viscountesses, and divers other ladies and gentlewomen of great credite and quality, besides common laundresses and others’, testifying that ‘the new white soap washeth whiter and sweeter than the old soap’.industrially manufactured bar soaps became available in the late 18th century, as advertising campaigns in europe and america promoted popular awareness of the relationship between cleanliness and health. in modern times, the use of soap has become commonplace in industrialized nations due to a better understanding of the role of hygiene in reducing the population size of pathogenic microorganisms.


=== 19th century ===

until the industrial revolution, soapmaking was conducted on a small scale and the product was rough. in 1780, james keir established a chemical works at tipton, for the manufacture of alkali from the sulfates of potash and soda, to which he afterwards added a soap manufactory. the method of extraction proceeded on a discovery of keir's. in 1790, nicolas leblanc discovered how to make alkali from common salt. andrew pears started making a high-quality, transparent soap in 1807 in london. his son-in-law, thomas j. barratt, opened a factory in isleworth in 1862.
during the restoration era (february 1665 – august 1714) a soap tax was introduced in england, which meant that until the mid-1800s, soap was a luxury, used regularly only by the well-to-do. the soap manufacturing process was closely supervised by revenue officials who made sure that soapmakers' equipment was kept under lock and key when not being supervised. moreover, soap could not be produced by small makers because of a law that stipulated that soap boilers must manufacture a minimum quantity of one imperial ton at each boiling, which placed the process beyond the reach of the average person. the soap trade was boosted and deregulated when the tax was repealed in 1853.william gossage produced low-priced, good-quality soap from the 1850s. robert spear hudson began manufacturing a soap powder in 1837, initially by grinding the soap with a mortar and pestle. american manufacturer benjamin t. babbitt introduced marketing innovations that included the sale of bar soap and distribution of product samples. william hesketh lever and his brother, james, bought a small soap works in warrington in 1886 and founded what is still one of the largest soap businesses, formerly called lever brothers and now called unilever. these soap businesses were among the first to employ large-scale advertising campaigns.


=== liquid soap ===

liquid soap was not invented until the nineteenth century; in 1865, william shepphard patented a liquid version of soap. in 1898, b.j. johnson developed a soap derived from palm and olive oils; his company, the b.j. johnson soap company, introduced ""palmolive"" brand soap that same year. this new brand of soap became popular rapidly, and to such a degree that b.j. johnson soap company changed its name to palmolive.in the early 1900s, other companies began to develop their own liquid soaps. such products as pine-sol and tide appeared on the market, making the process of cleaning things other than skin, such as clothing, floors, and bathrooms, much easier.
liquid soap also works better for more traditional or non-machine washing methods, such as using a washboard.


== soap-making for hobbyists ==
a variety of methods are available for hobbyists to make soap. most soapmakers use processes where the glycerol remains in the product, and the saponification continues for many days after the soap is poured into molds. the glycerol is left during the hot process method, but at the high temperature employed, the reaction is practically completed in the kettle, before the soap is poured into molds. this simple and quick process is employed in small factories all over the world.
handmade soap from the cold process also differs from industrially made soap in that an excess of fat is used, beyond that needed to consume the alkali (in a cold-pour process, this excess fat is called ""superfatting""), and the glycerol left in acts as a moisturizing agent. however, the glycerine also makes the soap softer. the addition of glycerol and processing of this soap produces glycerin soap. superfatted soap is more skin-friendly than one without extra fat, although it can leave a ""greasy"" feel. sometimes, an emollient is added, such as jojoba oil or shea butter. sand or pumice may be added to produce a scouring soap. the scouring agents serve to remove dead cells from the skin surface being cleaned. this process is called exfoliation.

to make antibacterial soap, compounds such as triclosan or triclocarban can be added. there is some concern that use of antibacterial soaps and other products might encourage antibiotic resistance in microorganisms.

segmented neutrophil of bone marrow,cell,"granulocytes are a category of white blood cells in the innate immune system characterized by the presence of specific granules in their cytoplasm. they are also called polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn, pml, or pmnl) because of the varying shape of the nucleus, which is usually lobed into three segments. this distinguishes them from the mononuclear agranulocytes. the term polymorphonuclear leukocyte often refers specifically to ""neutrophil granulocytes"", the most abundant of the granulocytes; the other types (eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells) have lower numbers of lobes. granulocytes are produced via granulopoiesis in the bone marrow.


== types ==
there are four types of granulocytes (full name polymorphonuclear granulocytes):
basophils
eosinophils
neutrophils
mast cellsexcept for the mast cells, their names are derived from their staining characteristics; for example, the most abundant granulocyte is the neutrophil granulocyte, which has neutrally staining cytoplasmic granules.


=== neutrophils ===

neutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte, constituting 60% to 65% of the total circulating white blood cells, and consisting of two subpopulations: neutrophil-killers and neutrophil-cagers. one litre of human blood contains about five billion (5x109) neutrophils, which are about 12–15 micrometres in diameter. once neutrophils have received the appropriate signals, it takes them about thirty minutes to leave the blood and reach the site of an infection. neutrophils do not return to the blood; they turn into pus cells and die. mature neutrophils are smaller than monocytes, and have a segmented nucleus with several sections(two to five segments); each section is connected by chromatin filaments. neutrophils do not normally exit the bone marrow until maturity, but during an infection neutrophil precursors called myelocytes and promyelocytes are released.neutrophils have three strategies for directly attacking micro-organisms: phagocytosis (ingestion), release of soluble anti-microbials (including granule proteins), and generation of neutrophil extracellular traps (nets).
neutrophils are professional phagocytes: they are ferocious eaters and rapidly engulf invaders coated with antibodies and complement, as well as damaged cells or cellular debris. the intracellular granules of the human neutrophil have long been recognized for their protein-destroying and bactericidal properties. neutrophils can  secrete products that stimulate monocytes and macrophages; these secretions increase phagocytosis and the formation of reactive oxygen compounds involved in intracellular killing.neutrophils have two types of granules; primary (azurophilic) granules (found in young cells) and secondary (specific) granules (which are found in more mature cells). primary granules contain cationic proteins and defensins that are used to kill bacteria, proteolytic enzymes and cathepsin g to break down (bacterial) proteins, lysozyme to break down bacterial cell walls, and myeloperoxidase (used to generate toxic bacteria-killing substances). in addition, secretions from the primary granules of neutrophils stimulate the phagocytosis of igg antibody-coated bacteria. the secondary granules contain compounds that are involved in the formation of toxic oxygen compounds, lysozyme, and lactoferrin (used to take essential iron from bacteria).  neutrophil extracellular traps (nets) comprise a web of fibers composed of chromatin and serine proteases that trap and kill microbes extracellularly. trapping of bacteria is a particularly important role for nets in sepsis, where net are formed within blood vessels.


=== eosinophils ===

eosinophils also have kidney-shaped lobed nuclei (two to four lobes). the number of granules in an eosinophil can vary because they have a tendency to degranulate while in the blood stream. eosinophils play a crucial part in the killing of parasites (e.g., enteric nematodes) because their granules contain a unique, toxic basic protein and cationic protein (e.g., cathepsin); receptors that bind to ige are used to help with this task. these cells also have a limited ability to participate in phagocytosis, they are professional antigen-presenting cells, they regulate other immune cell functions (e.g., cd4+ t cell, dendritic cell, b cell, mast cell, neutrophil, and basophil functions), they are involved in the destruction of tumor cells, and they promote the repair of damaged tissue. a polypeptide called interleukin-5 interacts with eosinophils and causes them to grow and differentiate; this polypeptide is produced by basophils and by t-helper 2 cells (th2).


=== basophils ===

basophils are one of the least abundant cells in bone marrow and blood (occurring at less than two percent of all cells). like neutrophils and eosinophils, they have lobed nuclei; however, they have only two lobes, and the chromatin filaments that connect them are not very visible. basophils have receptors that can bind to ige, igg, complement, and histamine. the cytoplasm of basophils contains a varied amount of granules; these granules are usually numerous enough to partially conceal the nucleus. granule contents of basophils are abundant with histamine, heparin, chondroitin sulfate, peroxidase, platelet-activating factor, and other substances.
when an infection occurs, mature basophils will be released from the bone marrow and travel to the site of infection. when basophils are injured, they will release histamine, which contributes to the inflammatory response that helps fight invading organisms. histamine causes dilation and increased permeability of capillaries close to the basophil. injured basophils and other leukocytes will release another substance called prostaglandins that contributes to an increased blood flow to the site of infection. both of these mechanisms allow blood-clotting elements to be delivered to the infected area (this begins the recovery process and blocks the travel of microbes to other parts of the body). increased permeability of the inflamed tissue also allows for more phagocyte migration to the site of infection so that they can consume microbes.


=== mast cells ===

mast cells are a type of granulocyte that are present in tissues; they mediate host defense against pathogens (e.g., parasites) and allergic reactions, particularly anaphylaxis. mast cells are also involved in mediating inflammation and autoimmunity as well as mediating and regulating neuroimmune system responses.


== development ==
granulocytes are derived from stem cells residing in the bone marrow. the differentiation of these stem cells from pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell into granulocytes is termed granulopoiesis. multiple intermediate cell types exist in this differentiation process, including myeloblasts and promyelocytes.


== function ==


=== granule contents ===
examples of toxic materials  produced or released by degranulation by granulocytes on the ingestion of microorganisms are:

antimicrobial agents (defensins and eosinophil cationic protein)
enzymes
acid hydrolases: further digest bacteria
lysozyme: dissolves cell walls of some gram-positive bacteria
low ph vesicles (3.5-4.0)
toxic nitrogen oxides (nitric oxide)
toxic oxygen-derived products (e.g., superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxy radicals, singlet oxygen, hypohalite)


== clinical significance ==
granulocytopenia is an abnormally low concentration of granulocytes in the blood. this condition reduces the body's resistance to many infections. closely related terms include agranulocytosis (etymologically, ""no granulocytes at all""; clinically, granulocyte levels less than 5% of normal) and neutropenia (deficiency of neutrophil granulocytes).  granulocytes live only one to two days in circulation (four days in spleen or other tissue), so transfusion of granulocytes as a therapeutic strategy would confer a very short-lasting benefit. in addition, there are many complications associated with such a procedure.
there is usually a granulocyte chemotactic defect in individuals suffering from type 1 diabetes mellitus.
research suggests giving granulocyte transfusions to prevent infections decreased the number of people who had a bacterial or fungal infection in the blood. further research suggests participants receiving therapeutic granulocyte transfusions show no difference in clinical reversal of concurrent infection.

general transcription factor ii-i repeat domain-containing protein 2a,protein,"in molecular biology, a transcription factor (tf) (or sequence-specific dna-binding factor) is a protein that controls the rate of transcription of genetic information from dna to messenger rna, by binding to a specific dna sequence. the function of tfs is to regulate—turn on and off—genes in order to make sure that they are expressed in the right cell at the right time and in the right amount throughout the life of the cell and the organism. groups of tfs function in a coordinated fashion to direct cell division, cell growth, and cell death throughout life; cell migration and organization (body plan) during embryonic development; and intermittently in response to signals from outside the cell, such as a hormone.  there are up to 1600 tfs in the human genome. transcription factors are members of proteome as well as regulome.  
tfs work alone or with other proteins in a complex, by promoting (as an activator), or blocking (as a repressor) the recruitment of rna polymerase (the enzyme that performs the transcription of genetic information from dna to rna) to specific genes.a defining feature of tfs is that they contain at least one dna-binding domain (dbd), which attaches to a specific sequence of dna adjacent to the genes that they regulate.  tfs are grouped into classes based on their dbds. other proteins such as coactivators, chromatin remodelers, histone acetyltransferases, histone deacetylases, kinases, and methylases are also essential to gene regulation, but lack dna-binding domains, and therefore are not tfs.tfs are of interest in medicine because tf mutations can cause specific diseases, and medications can be potentially targeted toward them.


== number ==

transcription factors are essential for the regulation of gene expression and are, as a consequence, found in all living organisms. the number of transcription factors found within an organism increases with genome size, and larger genomes tend to have more transcription factors per gene.there are approximately 2800 proteins in the human genome that contain dna-binding domains, and 1600 of these are presumed to function as transcription factors, though other studies indicate it to be a smaller number.  therefore, approximately 10% of genes in the genome code for transcription factors, which makes this family the single largest family of human proteins.  furthermore, genes are often flanked by several binding sites for distinct transcription factors, and efficient expression of each of these genes requires the cooperative action of several different transcription factors (see, for example, hepatocyte nuclear factors).  hence, the combinatorial use of a subset of the approximately 2000 human transcription factors easily accounts for the unique regulation of each gene in the human genome during development.


== mechanism ==
transcription factors bind to either enhancer or promoter regions of dna adjacent to the genes that they regulate.  depending on the transcription factor, the transcription of the adjacent gene is either up- or down-regulated.  transcription factors use a variety of mechanisms for the regulation of gene expression.  these mechanisms include:

stabilize or block the binding of rna polymerase to dna
catalyze the acetylation or deacetylation of histone proteins.  the transcription factor can either do this directly or recruit other proteins with this catalytic activity.  many transcription factors use one or the other of two opposing mechanisms to regulate transcription:histone acetyltransferase (hat) activity – acetylates histone proteins, which weakens the association of dna with histones, which make the dna more accessible to transcription, thereby up-regulating transcription
histone deacetylase (hdac) activity – deacetylates histone proteins, which strengthens the association of dna with histones, which make the dna less accessible to transcription, thereby down-regulating transcription
recruit coactivator or corepressor proteins to the transcription factor dna complex


== function ==
transcription factors are one of the groups of proteins that read and interpret the genetic ""blueprint"" in the dna.  they bind to the dna and help initiate a program of increased or decreased gene transcription.  as such, they are vital for many important cellular processes.  below are some of the important functions and biological roles transcription factors are involved in:


=== basal transcription regulation ===
in eukaryotes, an important class of transcription factors called general transcription factors (gtfs) are necessary for transcription to occur.  many of these gtfs do not actually bind dna, but rather are part of the large transcription preinitiation complex that interacts with rna polymerase directly.  the most common gtfs are tfiia, tfiib, tfiid (see also tata binding protein), tfiie, tfiif, and tfiih.  the preinitiation complex binds to promoter regions of dna upstream to the gene that they regulate.


=== differential enhancement of transcription ===
other transcription factors differentially regulate the expression of various genes by binding to enhancer regions of dna adjacent to regulated genes.  these transcription factors are critical to making sure that genes are expressed in the right cell at the right time and in the right amount, depending on the changing requirements of the organism.


==== development ====
many transcription factors in multicellular organisms are involved in development.  responding to stimuli, these transcription factors turn on/off the transcription of the appropriate genes, which, in turn, allows for changes in cell morphology or activities needed for cell fate determination and cellular differentiation.  the hox transcription factor family, for example, is important for proper body pattern formation in organisms as diverse as fruit flies to humans.  another example is the transcription factor encoded by the sex-determining region y (sry) gene, which plays a major role in determining sex in humans.


==== response to intercellular signals ====
cells can communicate with each other by releasing molecules that produce signaling cascades within another receptive cell.  if the signal requires upregulation or downregulation of genes in the recipient cell, often transcription factors will be downstream in the signaling cascade. estrogen signaling is an example of a fairly short signaling cascade that involves the estrogen receptor transcription factor:  estrogen is secreted by tissues such as the ovaries and placenta, crosses the cell membrane of the recipient cell, and is bound by the estrogen receptor in the cell's cytoplasm.  the estrogen receptor then goes to the cell's nucleus and binds to its dna-binding sites, changing the transcriptional regulation of the associated genes.


==== response to environment ====
not only do transcription factors act downstream of signaling cascades related to biological stimuli but they can also be downstream of signaling cascades involved in environmental stimuli.  examples include heat shock factor (hsf), which upregulates genes necessary for survival at higher temperatures, hypoxia inducible factor (hif), which upregulates genes necessary for cell survival in low-oxygen environments, and sterol regulatory element binding protein (srebp), which helps maintain proper lipid levels in the cell.


==== cell cycle control ====
many transcription factors, especially some that are proto-oncogenes or tumor suppressors, help regulate the cell cycle and as such determine how large a cell will get and when it can divide into two daughter cells.  one example is the myc oncogene, which has important roles in cell growth and apoptosis.


==== pathogenesis ====
transcription factors can also be used to alter gene expression in a host cell to promote pathogenesis.  a well studied example of this are the transcription-activator like effectors (tal effectors) secreted by xanthomonas bacteria.  when injected into plants, these proteins can enter the nucleus of the plant cell, bind plant promoter sequences, and activate transcription of plant genes that aid in bacterial infection. tal effectors contain a central repeat region in which there is a simple relationship between the identity of two critical residues in sequential repeats and sequential dna bases in the tal effector's target site. this property likely makes it easier for these proteins to evolve in order to better compete with the defense mechanisms of the host cell.


== regulation ==
it is common in biology for important processes to have multiple layers of regulation and control.  this is also true with transcription factors:  not only do transcription factors control the rates of transcription to regulate the amounts of gene products (rna and protein) available to the cell but transcription factors themselves are regulated (often by other transcription factors).  below is a brief synopsis of some of the ways that the activity of transcription factors can be regulated:


=== synthesis ===
transcription factors (like all proteins) are transcribed from a gene on a chromosome into rna, and then the rna is translated into protein.  any of these steps can be regulated to affect the production (and thus activity) of a transcription factor. an implication of this is that transcription factors can regulate themselves. for example, in a negative feedback loop, the transcription factor acts as its own repressor:  if the transcription factor protein binds the dna of its own gene, it down-regulates the production of more of itself.  this is one mechanism to maintain low levels of a transcription factor in a cell.


=== nuclear localization ===
in eukaryotes, transcription factors (like most proteins) are transcribed in the nucleus but are then translated in the cell's cytoplasm.  many proteins that are active in the nucleus contain nuclear localization signals that direct them to the nucleus.  but, for many transcription factors, this is a key point in their regulation.  important classes of transcription factors such as some nuclear receptors must first bind a ligand while in the cytoplasm before they can relocate to the nucleus.


=== activation ===
transcription factors may be activated (or deactivated) through their signal-sensing domain by a number of mechanisms including:

ligand binding – not only is ligand binding able to influence where a transcription factor is located within a cell but ligand binding can also affect whether the transcription factor is in an active state and capable of binding dna or other cofactors (see, for example, nuclear receptors).
phosphorylation – many transcription factors such as stat proteins must be phosphorylated before they can bind dna.
interaction with other transcription factors (e.g., homo- or hetero-dimerization) or coregulatory proteins


=== accessibility of dna-binding site ===
in eukaryotes, dna is organized with the help of histones into compact particles called nucleosomes, where sequences of about 147 dna base pairs make ~1.65 turns around histone protein octamers. dna within nucleosomes is inaccessible to many transcription factors. some transcription factors, so-called pioneer factors are still able to bind their dna binding sites on the nucleosomal dna. for most other transcription factors, the nucleosome should be actively unwound by molecular motors such as chromatin remodelers. alternatively, the nucleosome can be partially unwrapped by thermal fluctuations, allowing temporary access to the transcription factor binding site. in many cases, a transcription factor needs to compete for binding to its dna binding site with other transcription factors and histones or non-histone chromatin proteins.  pairs of transcription factors and other proteins can play antagonistic roles (activator versus repressor) in the regulation of the same gene.


=== availability of other cofactors/transcription factors ===
most transcription factors do not work alone.  many large tf families form complex homotypic or heterotypic interactions through dimerization. for gene transcription to occur, a number of transcription factors must bind to dna regulatory sequences.  this collection of transcription factors, in turn, recruit intermediary proteins such as cofactors that allow efficient recruitment of the preinitiation complex and rna polymerase.  thus, for a single transcription factor to initiate transcription, all of these other proteins must also be present, and the transcription factor must be in a state where it can bind to them if necessary.
cofactors are proteins that modulate the effects of transcription factors. cofactors are interchangeable between specific gene promoters; the protein complex that occupies the promoter dna and the amino acid sequence of the cofactor determine its spatial conformation. for example, certain steroid receptors can exchange cofactors with nf-κb, which is a switch between inflammation and cellular differentiation; thereby steroids can affect the inflammatory response and function of certain tissues.


=== interaction with methylated cytosine ===
transcription factors and methylated cytosines in dna both have major roles in regulating gene expression.  (methylation of cytosine in dna primarily occurs where cytosine is followed by guanine in the 5’ to 3’ dna sequence, a cpg site.)  methylation of cpg sites in a promoter region of a gene usually represses gene transcription, while methylation of cpgs in the body of a gene increases expression.  tet enzymes play a central role in demethylation of methylated cytosines.  demethylation of cpgs in a gene promoter by tet enzyme activity increases transcription of the gene.the dna binding sites of 519 transcription factors were evaluated.   of these, 169 transcription factors (33%) did not have cpg dinucleotides in their binding sites, and 33 transcription factors (6%) could bind to a cpg-containing motif but did not display a preference for a binding site with either a methylated or unmethylated cpg.  there were 117 transcription factors (23%) that were inhibited from binding to their binding sequence if it contained a methylated cpg site, 175 transcription factors (34%) that had enhanced binding if their binding sequence had a methylated cpg site, and 25 transcription factors (5%) were either inhibited or had enhanced binding depending on where in the binding sequence the methylated cpg was located.
tet enzymes do not specifically bind to methylcytosine except when recruited (see dna demethylation).  multiple transcription factors important in cell differentiation and lineage specification, including nanog, sall4a, wt1, ebf1, pu.1, and e2a, have been shown to recruit tet enzymes to specific genomic loci (primarily enhancers) to act on methylcytosine (mc) and convert it to hydroxymethylcytosine hmc (and in most cases marking them for subsequent complete demethylation to cytosine).  tet-mediated conversion of mc to hmc appears to disrupt the binding of 5mc-binding proteins including mecp2 and mbd (methyl-cpg-binding domain) proteins, facilitating nucleosome remodeling and the binding of transcription factors, thereby activating transcription of those genes.  egr1 is an important transcription factor in memory formation.  it has an essential role in brain neuron epigenetic reprogramming.  the transcription factor egr1 recruits the tet1 protein that initiates a pathway of dna demethylation.  egr1, together with tet1, is employed in programming the distribution of methylation sites on brain dna during brain development and in learning (see epigenetics in learning and memory).


== structure ==

transcription factors are modular in structure and contain the following domains:
dna-binding domain (dbd), which attaches to specific sequences of dna (enhancer or promoter. necessary component for all vectors. used to drive transcription of the vector's transgene promoter sequences) adjacent to regulated genes.  dna sequences that bind transcription factors are often referred to as response elements.
activation domain (ad), which contains binding sites for other proteins such as transcription coregulators.  these binding sites are frequently referred to as activation functions (afs), transactivation domain (tad) or trans-activating domain tad but not mix with topologically associating domain tad.
an optional signal-sensing domain (ssd) (e.g., a ligand binding domain), which senses external signals and, in response, transmits these signals to the rest of the transcription complex, resulting in up- or down-regulation of gene expression.  also, the dbd and signal-sensing domains may reside on separate proteins that associate within the transcription complex to regulate gene expression.


=== dna-binding domain ===

the portion (domain) of the transcription factor that binds dna is called its dna-binding domain.  below is a partial list of some of the major families of dna-binding domains/transcription factors:


=== response elements ===
the dna sequence that a transcription factor binds to is called a transcription factor-binding site or response element.transcription factors interact with their binding sites using a combination of electrostatic (of which hydrogen bonds are a special case) and van der waals forces.  due to the nature of these chemical interactions, most transcription factors bind dna in a sequence specific manner.  however, not all bases in the transcription factor-binding site may actually interact with the transcription factor.  in addition, some of these interactions may be weaker than others.  thus, transcription factors do not bind just one sequence but are capable of binding a subset of closely related sequences, each with a different strength of interaction.
for example, although the consensus binding site for the tata-binding protein (tbp) is tataaaa, the tbp transcription factor can also bind similar sequences such as tatatat or tatataa.
because transcription factors can bind a set of related sequences and these sequences tend to be short, potential transcription factor binding sites can occur by chance if the dna sequence is long enough.  it is unlikely, however, that a transcription factor will bind all compatible sequences in the genome of the cell.  other constraints, such as dna accessibility in the cell or availability of cofactors may also help dictate where a transcription factor will actually bind.  thus, given the genome sequence it is still difficult to predict where a transcription factor will actually bind in a living cell.
additional recognition specificity, however, may be obtained through the use of more than one dna-binding domain (for example tandem dbds in the same transcription factor or through dimerization of two transcription factors) that bind to two or more adjacent sequences of dna.


== clinical significance ==
transcription factors are of clinical significance for at least two reasons: (1) mutations can be associated with specific diseases, and (2) they can be targets of medications.


=== disorders ===
due to their important roles in development, intercellular signaling, and cell cycle, some human diseases have been associated with mutations in transcription factors.many transcription factors are either tumor suppressors or oncogenes, and, thus, mutations or aberrant regulation of them is associated with cancer. three groups of transcription factors are known to be important in human cancer: (1) the nf-kappab and ap-1 families, (2) the stat family and (3) the steroid receptors.below are a few of the better-studied examples:


=== potential drug targets ===

approximately 10% of currently prescribed drugs directly target the nuclear receptor class of transcription factors. examples include tamoxifen and bicalutamide for the treatment of breast and prostate cancer, respectively, and various types of anti-inflammatory and anabolic steroids. in addition, transcription factors are often indirectly modulated by drugs through signaling cascades. it might be possible to directly target other less-explored transcription factors such as nf-κb with drugs. transcription factors outside the nuclear receptor family are thought to be more difficult to target with small molecule therapeutics since it is not clear that they are ""drugable"" but progress has been made on pax2 and the notch pathway.


== role in evolution ==

gene duplications have played a crucial role in the evolution of species. this applies particularly to transcription factors. once they occur as duplicates, accumulated mutations encoding for one copy can take place without negatively affecting the regulation of downstream targets. however, changes of the dna binding specificities of the single-copy leafy transcription factor, which occurs in most land plants, have recently been elucidated. in that respect, a single-copy transcription factor can undergo a change of specificity through a promiscuous intermediate without losing function. similar mechanisms have been proposed in the context of all alternative phylogenetic hypotheses, and the role of transcription factors in the evolution of all species.


== analysis ==
there are different technologies available to analyze transcription factors. on the genomic level, dna-sequencing and database research are commonly used the protein version of the transcription factor is detectable by using specific antibodies. the sample is detected on a western blot. by using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (emsa), the activation profile of transcription factors can be detected. a multiplex approach for activation profiling is a tf chip system where several different transcription factors can be detected in parallel.
the most commonly used method for identifying transcription factor binding sites is chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip). this technique relies on chemical fixation of chromatin with formaldehyde, followed by co-precipitation of dna and the transcription factor of interest using an antibody that specifically targets that protein. the dna sequences can then be identified by microarray or high-throughput sequencing (chip-seq) to determine transcription factor binding sites. if no antibody is available for the protein of interest, damid may be a convenient alternative.


== classes ==
as described in more detail below, transcription factors may be classified by their (1) mechanism of action, (2) regulatory function, or (3) sequence homology (and hence structural similarity) in their dna-binding domains.


=== mechanistic ===
there are two mechanistic classes of transcription factors:

general transcription factors are involved in the formation of a preinitiation complex. the most common are abbreviated as tfiia, tfiib, tfiid, tfiie, tfiif, and tfiih. they are ubiquitous and interact with the core promoter region surrounding the transcription start site(s) of all class ii genes.
upstream transcription factors are proteins that bind somewhere upstream of the initiation site to stimulate or repress transcription. these are roughly synonymous with specific transcription factors, because they vary considerably depending on what recognition sequences are present in the proximity of the gene.


=== functional ===
transcription factors have been classified according to their regulatory function:
i. constitutively active – present in all cells at all times – general transcription factors, sp1, nf1, ccaat
ii. conditionally active – requires activation
ii.a developmental (cell specific) – expression is tightly controlled, but, once expressed, require no additional activation – gata, hnf, pit-1, myod, myf5, hox, winged helix
ii.b signal-dependent – requires external signal for activation
ii.b.1 extracellular ligand (endocrine or paracrine)-dependent – nuclear receptors
ii.b.2 intracellular ligand (autocrine)-dependent - activated by small intracellular molecules – srebp, p53, orphan nuclear receptors
ii.b.3 cell membrane receptor-dependent – second messenger signaling cascades resulting in the phosphorylation of the transcription factor
ii.b.3.a resident nuclear factors – reside in the nucleus regardless of activation state – creb, ap-1, mef2
ii.b.3.b latent cytoplasmic factors – inactive form reside in the cytoplasm, but, when activated, are translocated into the nucleus – stat, r-smad, nf-κb, notch, tubby, nfat

hydrocortisone toothpaste,drug,"angular cheilitis (ac) is inflammation of one or both corners of the mouth. often the corners are red with skin breakdown and crusting. it can also be itchy or painful. the condition can last for days to years. angular cheilitis is a type of cheilitis (inflammation of the lips).angular cheilitis can be caused by infection, irritation, or allergies. infections include by fungi such as candida albicans and bacteria  such as staph. aureus. irritants include poorly fitting dentures, licking the lips or drooling, mouth breathing resulting in a dry mouth, sun exposure, overclosure of the mouth, smoking, and minor trauma. allergies may include substances like toothpaste, makeup, and food. often a number of factors are involved. other factors may include poor nutrition or poor immune function. diagnosis may be helped by testing for infections and patch testing for allergies.treatment for angular cheilitis is typically based on the underlying causes along with the use of a barrier cream. frequently an antifungal and antibacterial cream is also tried. angular cheilitis is a fairly common problem, with estimates that it affects 0.7% of the population. it occurs most often in people in their 30s to 60s, and is also relatively common in children. in the developing world, iron and vitamin deficiencies are a common cause.


== signs and symptoms ==

angular cheilitis is a fairly non specific term which describes the presence of an inflammatory lesion in a particular anatomic site (i.e. the corner of the mouth). as there are different possible causes and contributing factors from one person to the next, the appearance of the lesion is somewhat variable. the lesions are more commonly symmetrically present on both sides of the mouth, but sometimes only one side may be affected. in some cases, the lesion may be confined to the mucosa of the lips, and in other cases the lesion may extend past the vermilion border (the edge where the lining on the lips becomes the skin on the face) onto the facial skin. initially, the corners of the mouth develop a gray-white thickening and adjacent erythema (redness). later, the usual appearance is a roughly triangular area of erythema, edema (swelling) and breakdown of skin at either corner of the mouth. the mucosa of the lip may become fissured (cracked), crusted, ulcerated or atrophied. there is not usually any bleeding. where the skin is involved, there may be radiating rhagades (linear fissures) from the corner of the mouth. infrequently, the dermatitis (which may resemble eczema) can extend from the corner of the mouth to the skin of the cheek or chin. if staphylococcus aureus is involved, the lesion may show golden yellow crusts. in chronic angular cheilitis, there may be suppuration (pus formation), exfoliation (scaling) and formation of granulation tissue.sometimes contributing factors can be readily seen, such as loss of lower face height from poorly made or worn dentures, which results in mandibular overclosure (""collapse of jaws""). if there is a nutritional deficiency underlying the condition, various other signs and symptoms such as glossitis (swollen tongue) may be present. in people with angular cheilitis who wear dentures, often there may be erythematous mucosa underneath the denture (normally the upper denture), an appearance consistent with denture-related stomatitis. typically the lesions give symptoms of soreness, pain, pruritus (itching) or burning or a raw feeling.


== causes ==
angular cheilitis is thought to be multifactorial disorder of infectious origin, with many local and systemic predisposing factors. the sores in angular cheilitis are often infected with fungi (yeasts), bacteria, or a combination thereof; this may represent a secondary, opportunistic infection by these pathogens. some studies have linked the initial onset of angular cheilitis with nutritional deficiencies, especially of the b(b2-riboflavin) vitamins and iron (which causes iron deficiency anemia), which in turn may be evidence of malnutrition or malabsorption. angular cheilitis can be a manifestation of contact dermatitis, which is considered in two groups; irritational and allergic.


=== infection ===
the involved organisms are:

candida species alone (usually candida albicans), which accounts for about 20% of cases,
bacterial species, either:
staphylococcus aureus alone, which accounts for about 20% of cases,
β-hemolytic streptococci alone. these types of bacteria have been detected in between 8–15% of cases of angular cheilitis, but less commonly are they present in isolation,
or a combination of the above organisms, (a polymicrobial infection) with about 60% of cases involving both c. albicans and s. aureus.candida can be detected in 93% of angular cheilitis lesions. this organism is found in the mouths of  about 40% of healthy individuals, and it is considered by some to be normal commensal component of the oral microbiota. however, candida shows dimorphism, namely a yeast form which is thought to be relatively harmless and a pathogenic hyphal form which is associated with invasion of host tissues. potassium hydroxide preparation is recommended by some to help distinguish between the harmless and the pathogenic forms, and thereby highlight which cases of angular cheilitis are truly caused by candida. the mouth may act as a reservoir of candida that reinfects the sores at the corners of the mouth and prevents the sores from healing.
a lesion caused by recurrence of a latent herpes simplex infection can occur in the corner of the mouth. this is herpes labialis (a cold sore), and is sometimes termed ""angular herpes simplex"". a cold sore at the corner of the mouth behaves similarly to elsewhere on the lips, and follows a pattern of vesicle (blister) formation followed by rupture leaving a crusted sore which resolves in about 7–10 days, and recurs in the same spot periodically, especially during periods of stress. rather than utilizing antifungal creams, angular herpes simplex is treated in the same way as a cold sore, with topical antiviral drugs such as aciclovir.


=== irritation contact dermatitis ===

 
22% of cases of angular cheilitis are due to irritants. saliva contains digestive enzymes, which may have a degree of digestive action on tissues if they are left in contact. the corner of the mouth is normally exposed to saliva more than any other part of the lips. reduced lower facial height (vertical dimension or facial support) is usually caused by edentulism (tooth loss), or wearing worn down, old dentures or ones which are not designed optimally. this results in overclosure of the mandible (collapse of the jaws), which extenuates the angular 
skin folds at the corners of the mouth, in effect creating an intertriginous skin crease. the tendency of saliva to pool in these areas is increased, constantly wetting the area, which may cause tissue maceration and favors the development of a yeast infection. as such, angular cheilitis is more commonly seen in edentulous people (people without any teeth). it is by contrast uncommon in persons who retain their natural teeth.  angular cheilitis is also commonly seen in denture wearers. angular cheilitis is present in about 30% of people with denture-related stomatitis. it is thought that reduced vertical dimension of the lower face may be a contributing factor in up to 11% of elderly persons with angular cheilitis and in up to 18% of denture wearers who have angular cheilitis. reduced vertical dimension can also be caused by tooth migration, wearing orthodontic appliances, and elastic tissue damage caused by ultraviolet light exposure and smoking.habits or conditions that keep the corners of the mouth moist might include chronic lip licking, thumb sucking (or sucking on other objects such as pens, pipes, lollipops), dental cleaning (e.g. flossing), chewing gum, hypersalivation, drooling and mouth breathing. some consider habitual lip licking or picking to be a form of nervous tic, and do not consider this to be true angular cheilitis, instead calling it perlèche (derived from the french word pourlècher meaning ""to lick one’s lips""), or ""factitious cheilitis"" is applied to this habit. the term ""cheilocandidiasis"" describes exfoliative (flaking) lesions of the lips and the skin around the lips, and is caused by a superficial candidal infection due to chronic lip licking. less severe cases occur during cold, dry weather, and is a form of chapped lips. individuals may lick their lips in an attempt to provide a temporary moment of relief, only serving to worsen the condition.the sunscreen in some types of lip balm degrades over time into an irritant. using expired lipbalm can initiate mild angular cheilitis, and when the person applies more lipbalm to alleviate the cracking, it only aggravates it. because of the delayed onset of contact dermatitis and the recovery period lasting days to weeks, people typically do not make the connection between the causative agent and the symptoms.


=== nutritional deficiencies ===
several different nutritional deficiency states of vitamins or minerals have been linked to ac. it is thought that in about 25% of people with ac, iron deficiency or deficiency of b vitamins are involved. nutritional deficiencies may be a more common cause of ac in third world countries. chronic iron deficiency may also cause koilonychia (spoon shaped deformity of the fingernails) and glossitis (inflammation of the tongue). it is not completely understood how iron deficiency causes ac, but it is known that it causes a degree of immunocompromise (decreased efficiency of the immune system) which may in turn allow an opportunistic infection of candida. vitamin b2 deficiency (ariboflavinosis) may also cause ac, and other conditions such as redness of mucous membranes, magenta colored glossitis (pink inflammation of the tongue). vitamin b5 deficiency may also cause ac, along with glossitis, and skin changes similar to seborrhoeic dermatitis around the eyes, nose and mouth. vitamin b12 deficiency is sometimes responsible for ac, and commonly occurs together with folate deficiency (a lack of folic acid), which also causes glossitis and megaloblastic anemia. vitamin b3 deficiency (pellagra) is another possible cause, and in which other association conditions such as dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia and glossitis can occur. biotin (vitamin b7) deficiency has also been reported to cause ac, along with hair loss (alopecia) and dry eyes. zinc deficiency is known to cause ac. other symptoms may include diarrhea, alopecia and dermatitis. acrodermatitis enteropathica is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder causing impaired absorption of zinc, and is associated with ac.in general, these nutritional disorders may be caused by malnutrition, such as may occur in alcoholism or in poorly considered diets, or by malabsorption secondary to gastrointestinal disorders (e.g. coeliac disease or chronic pancreatitis) or gastrointestinal surgeries (e.g. pernicious anemia caused by ileal resection in crohn's disease).


=== systemic disorders ===
some systemic disorders are involved in angular cheilitis by virtue of their association with malabsorption and the creation of nutritional deficiencies described above. such examples include people with anorexia nervosa.  other disorders may cause lip enlargement (e.g. orofacial granulomatosis), which alters the local anatomy and extenuates the skin folds at the corners of the mouth. more still may be involved because they affect the immune system, allowing normally harmless organisms like candida to become pathogenic and cause an infection. xerostomia (dry mouth) is thought to account for about 5% of cases of ac. xerostomia itself has many possible causes, but commonly the cause may be side effects of medications, or conditions such as sjögren's syndrome. conversely, conditions which cause drooling or sialorrhoea (excessive salivation) can cause angular cheilitis by creating a constant wet environment in the corners of the mouth. about 25% of people with down syndrome appear to have ac. this is due to relative macroglossia, an apparently large tongue in a small mouth, which may constantly stick out of the mouth causing maceration of the corners of the mouth with saliva. inflammatory bowel diseases (such as crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) can be associated with angular cheilitis. in crohn's, it is likely the result of malabsorption and immunosuppressive therapy which gives rise to the sores at the corner of the mouth. glucagonomas are rare pancreatic endocrine tumors which secrete glucagon, and cause a syndrome of dermatitis, glucose intolerance, weight loss and anemia. ac is a common feature of glucagonoma syndrome. infrequently, angular cheilitis may be one of the manifestations of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, and sometimes cases of oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis may accompany angular cheilitis. angular cheilitis may be present in human immunodeficiency virus infection, neutropenia, or diabetes. angular cheilitis is more common in people with eczema because their skin is more sensitive to irritants. other conditions possibly associated include plasma cell gingivitis, melkersson-rosenthal syndrome, or sideropenic dysphagia (also called plummer-vinson syndrome or paterson-brown-kelly syndrome).


=== drugs ===
several drugs may cause ac as a side effect, by various mechanisms, such as creating drug-induced xerostomia. various examples include isotretinoin, indinavir, and sorafenib. isotretinoin (accutane), an analog of vitamin a, is a medication which dries the skin. less commonly, angular cheilitis is associated with primary hypervitaminosis a, which can occur when large amounts of liver (including cod liver oil and other fish oils) are regularly consumed or as a result from an excess intake of vitamin a in the form of vitamin supplements. recreational drug users may develop ac. examples include cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and hallucinogens.


=== allergic contact dermatitis ===

allergic reactions may account for about 25–34% of cases of generalized cheilitis (i.e., inflammation not confined to the angles of the mouth). it is unknown how frequently allergic reactions are responsible for cases of angular cheilitis, but any substance capable of causing generalized allergic cheilitis may present involving the corners of the mouth alone.
examples of potential allergens include substances that may be present in some types of lipstick, toothpaste, acne products, cosmetics, chewing gum, mouthwash, foods, dental appliances, and materials from dentures or mercury containing amalgam fillings. it is usually impossible to tell the difference between irritant contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis without a patch test.


=== loss of lower facial height ===
severe tooth wear or ill fitting dentures may cause wrinkling at the corners of the lip that creates a favorable environment for the condition. this can be corrected with onlays or crowns on the worn teeth to restore height or new dentures with ""taller"" teeth. the loss of vertical dimension has been associated with angular cheilitis in older individuals with an increase in facial laxity.


== diagnosis ==

angular cheilitis is normally a diagnosis made clinically. if the sore is unilateral, rather than bilateral, this suggests a local factor (e.g., trauma) or a split syphilitic papule. angular cheilitis caused by mandibular overclosure, drooling, and other irritants is usually bilateral.the lesions are normally swabbed to detect if candida or pathogenic bacterial species may be present. persons with angular cheilitis who wear dentures often also will have their denture swabbed in addition. a complete blood count (full blood count) may be indicated, including assessment of the levels of iron, ferritin, vitamin b12 (and possibly other b vitamins), and folate.


=== classification ===
angular cheilitis could be considered to be a type of cheilitis or stomatitis. where candida species are involved, angular cheilitis is classed as a type of oral candidiasis, specifically a primary (group i) candida-associated lesion. this form angular cheilitis which is caused by candida is sometimes termed ""candida-associated angular cheilitis"", or less commonly, ""monilial perlèche"". angular cheilitis can also be classified as acute (sudden, short-lived appearance of the condition) or chronic (lasts a long time or keeps returning), or refractory (the condition persists despite attempts to treat it).


== management ==
there are four aspects to the treatment of angular cheilitis. firstly, potential reservoirs of infection inside the mouth are identified and treated. oral candidiasis, especially denture-related stomatitis is often found to be present where there is angular cheilitis, and if it is not treated, the sores at the corners of the mouth may often recur. this involves having dentures properly fitted and disinfected. commercial preparations are marketed for this purpose, although dentures may be left in dilute (1:10 concentration) household bleach overnight, but only if they are entirely plastic and do not contain any metal parts, and with rinsing under clean water before use. improved denture hygiene is often required thereafter, including not wearing the denture during sleep and cleaning it daily. for more information, see denture-related stomatitis.
secondly, there may be a need to increase the vertical dimension of the lower face to prevent overclosure of the mouth and formation of deep skin folds. this may require the construction of a new denture with an adjusted bite. rarely, in cases resistant to normal treatments, surgical procedures such as collagen injections (or other facial fillers such as autologous fat or crosslinked hyaluronic acid) are used in an attempt to restore the normal facial contour. other measures which seek to reverse the local factors that may be contributing to the condition include improving oral hygiene, stopping smoking or other tobacco habits and use of a barrier cream (e.g. zinc oxide paste) at night.thirdly, treatment of the infection and inflammation of the lesions themselves is addressed. this is usually with topical antifungal medication, such as clotrimazole, amphotericin b, ketoconazole, or nystatin cream. some antifungal creams are combined with corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone or triamcinolone to reduce inflammation, and certain antifungals such as miconazole also have some antibacterial action. diiodohydroxyquinoline is another topical therapy for angular cheilitis. if staphylococcus aureus infection is demonstrated by microbiological culture to be responsible (or suspected), the treatment may be changed to fusidic acid cream, an antibiotic which is effective against this type of bacteria. aside from fusidic acid, neomycin, mupirocin, metronidazole, and chlorhexidine are alternative options in this scenario.
finally, if the condition appears resistant to treatment, investigations for underlying causes such as anemia or nutrient deficiencies or hiv infection. identification of the underlying cause is essential for treating chronic cases. the lesions may resolve when the underlying disease is treated, e.g. with a course of oral iron or b vitamin supplements. patch testing is recommended by some in cases which are resistant to treatment and where allergic contact dermatitis is suspected.


== prognosis ==
most cases of angular cheilitis respond quickly when antifungal treatment is used. in more long standing cases, the severity of the condition often follows a relapsing and remitting course over time. the condition can be difficult to treat and can be prolonged.


== epidemiology ==
ac is a relatively common condition, accounting for between 0.7 – 3.8% of oral mucosal lesions in adults and between 0.2 – 15.1% in children, though overall it occurs most commonly in adults in the third to sixth decades of life. it occurs worldwide, and both males and females are affected. angular cheilitis is the most common presentation of fungal and bacterial infections of the lips.


== etymology ==
the term ""angular cheilitis"" is from ancient greek, χείλος meaning lip and -itis meaning inflammation.

== history ==
the first archaeological expedition was performed in 1951. the ruins of the fortress are to be found in one of the highest hills of the krrabë, at about 479 metres (1,572 ft) above sea level. it is thought that dimale may have been situated in the dorëzi fortress. the surrounding wall is in its southern part, and is 300 metres (980 ft) long from east to west. the fortress construction seems to have had three phases—the first with raw stones, the second with carved blocks placed with no mortar (hellenistic period) and the third with crushed stones and the use of mortar (4th–6th centuries ad).  one can see the main entrance of the fortress. the presence of old vases that date to those centuries suggests that the site was inhabited until at least the 4th–6th centuries ad.

ras-related protein rab-11a isoform 1 (rat),protein,"neuregulin 1, or nrg1, is a gene of the epidermal growth factor family that in humans is encoded by the nrg1 gene. nrg1 is one of four proteins in the neuregulin family that act on the egfr family of receptors. neuregulin 1 is produced in numerous isoforms by alternative splicing, which allows it to perform a wide variety of functions. it is essential for the normal development of the nervous system and the heart.


== structure ==
neuregulin 1 (nrg1) was originally identified as a 44-kd glycoprotein that interacts with the neu/erbb2 receptor tyrosine kinase to increase its phosphorylation on tyrosine residues. it is known that an extraordinary variety of different isoforms are produced from the nrg1 gene by alternative splicing. these isoforms include heregulins (hrgs), glial growth factors (ggfs) and sensory and motor neuron-derived factor (smdf). they are tissue-specific and differ significantly in their structure. the hrg isoforms all contain immunoglobulin (ig) and epidermal growth factor-like (egf-like) domains. ggf and ggf2 isoforms contain a kringle-like sequence plus ig and egf-like domains; and the smdf isoform shares only the egf-like domain with other isoforms. the receptors for all nrg1 isoforms are the erbb family of tyrosine kinase transmembrane receptors. through their displayed interaction with erbb receptors, nrg1 isoforms induce the growth and differentiation of epithelial, neuronal, glial, and other types of cells.


== function ==


=== synaptic plasticity ===
neuregulin 1 is thought to play a role in synaptic plasticity. it has been shown that a loss of neuregulin 1 within cortical projection neurons results in increased inhibitory connections and reduced synaptic plasticity.  similarly, overexpression of neuregulin 1 results in disrupted excitatory-inhibitory connections, reduced synaptic plasticity, and abnormal dendritic spine growth. mutations in human l1 cell adhesion molecules are reported to cause a number of neuronal disorders. in addition, recent research in drosophila model has also shown nrg's involvement in regulating dendritic pruning in ddac neurons in a rab5/escrt-mediated endocytic pathway. thus, careful regulation of the amount of neuregulin 1 must be maintained in order to preserve an intricate balance between excitatory and inhibitory connections within the central nervous system (cns). any disruption in this inhibitory system may contribute to impaired synaptic plasticity, a symptom endemic in schizophrenic patients.


== isoforms ==
at least six major types (different n termini) of neuregulin 1 are known. six types exist in humans and rodents (type i, ii and iii nrg1 are expressed in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, as well as astrocytes), and some types (i and iv) can be regulated by neuronal activity.


== clinical significance ==
neuregulin 1-erbb4 interactions are thought to play a role in the pathological mechanism of schizophrenia. a high-risk decode (icelandic) haplotype was discovered in 2002 on the 5'-end of the gene. the snp8nrg243177 allele from this haplotype was associated in 2006 with a heightened expression of the type iv nrg1 in the brains of people suffering from schizophrenia. further, the nrg1-erbb4 signalling complex has been highlighted as a potential target for new antipsychotic treatment.additionally, neuregulin 1 has been shown to modulate anxiety-like behaviors.  endogenous neuregulin 1 may bind to its receptor, erbb4, expressed on gabaergic neurons within the basolateral amygdala.  administration of exogenous neuregulin 1 to the basolateral amygdala of anxious mice produced an anxiolytic effect, which has been attributed to the enhancement of gabaergic neurotransmission.  thus, treatments aimed at reducing anxiety, which may contribute to emotional instability in many schizophrenic patients, by targeting the effects of mutations in nrg1 and erbb4, may yield positive results for those afflicted by both anxiety disorders as well as schizophrenia.
neuregulin has been shown to be involved in the myelination of central nervous system (cns) axons.  there exist at least two modes of myelination within the cns—one that is independent of neuronal activity and another that is promoted by the activation of nmda receptors by glutamate on oligodendrocytes.  neuregulin is involved in the ""switching"" of oligodendrocytes from the mode of myelination that is independent of neuronal activity to the mode that is dependent upon glutamate binding to nmda receptors.  it is thought that neuregulin 1 found on axons of cns neurons interacts with its receptor, erbb4, to promote the myelination of that axon, and any disruption in this signaling contributes to decreased myelination.  since neuregulin 1 promotes myelination and is decreased in schizophrenic patients, along with the finding that schizophrenic patients experience white matter deficits, mutations within neuregulin 1 may underlie cognitive deficits associated with lower white matter integrity, especially within frontotemporal connections.
the protein also has the putative ability to protect the brain from damage induced by stroke. those with a genetic variant of neuregulin 1 tended to be more creative.there is evidence that nrg1 is a tumor suppressor gene.there is also strong evidence that nrg1 plays a critical role in schwann cell maturation, survival, and motility, important in research related to neurofibromatosis type two (nf2).


=== heart ===
neuregulin-1 (nrg-1), a cardioactive growth factor released from endothelial cells, is necessary for cardiac development, structural maintenance, and functional integrity of the heart. nrg-1 and its receptor family erbb can play a beneficial role in the treatment of chronic heart failure (chf) by promoting survival of cardiac myocytes, improving sarcomeric structure, balancing ca2+ homeostasis, and enhancing pumping function. downstream effectors of nrg-1/erbb, include cardiac-specific myosin light chain kinase (cmlck), protein phosphatase type 1 (pp1), sarcoplasmic reticulum ca2+-atpase 2 (serca2), and focal adhesion kinase (fak). the beneficial effects of neuregulin-1 make recombinant human neuregulin-1 (rhnrg-1) a potential drug for treatment of chf.


=== maintenance of heart structure ===
nrg-1 treatment of adult rat ventricular myocytes stimulate the formation of a multiprotein complex between erbb2, fak, and p130(cas), which modulates the restoration of cell–cell contacts between isolated myocytes, allowing for synchronous beating.  furthermore, fak is also involved in the maintenance of sarcomeric organization, cell survival, and myocyte–myocyte interactions.  the sarcomeric effects of nrg-1 protects myocytes against structural disarray induced by stressors, including cytotoxic agents.


=== cardiomyocyte survival under stress ===
under conditions of stress, including viral infection, cytotoxic agents, and oxidative stress, activation of nrg-1/erbb signaling can protect myocardial cells against apoptosis. in contrast to embryonic and neonatal cardiomyocytes, adult myocardial cells are terminally differentiated and have lost the ability to proliferate. therefore, growth of adult cardiac cells is commonly characterized by hypertrophy and an increased content of contractile proteins. however, studies have shown nrg-1 promotes myocardial regeneration through hyperplasia, and prevents hypertrophy surrounding infarcted areas.


=== restoration of cardiomyocytes ===
the cmlck protein is an important regulator of sarcomere assembly through activation of the myosin regulatory light chain, as well as playing a role in heart contractility.  in contrast to smooth and skeletal muscle mlcks, cmlck expression is restricted to cardiac myocytes. overexpression of cmlck increases cell contractility. treatment of cardiac myocytes with rhnrg-1 significantly upregulated cmlck expression or activity??? in chf rat models, together with an improvement in both cardiomyocyte structure and pumping function. therefore, cmlck is a downstream protein regulated by nrg-1/erbb signaling and plays a role in rhnrg-1-mediated improvements in chf.


=== improvements in cardiac efficiency ===
altered calcium homeostasis has been suggested to play a role in the development of heart failure. modulated by phospholamban (plb), serca2 regulates uptake of ca2+ into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) from the cytoplasm and contributes to the relaxation of cardiomyocytes. this process is also important for determining the sr ca2+ load after relaxation and, thus, impacts on contractility.
pp1 dephosphorylates plb,  inhibiting serca2 activity.  in the failing heart, pp1 expression is upregulated, resulting in increased plb dephosphorylation and decreased serca2 activity. preliminary studies have revealed that rhnrg-normalizes serca function and enhances myocardial contractility through the inhibition of increasedpp1 expression, which leads to increased plb phosphorylation and activation of serca2.


== interactions ==
neuregulin 1 has been shown to interact with erbb3 and limk1.
a schizophrenia associated- missense mutation in neuregulin 1 has been shown to be associated with changes in cytokine expression using lymphoblastoid cells of heterozygous carriers vs homozygous wild type individuals specifically, the missense mutation involves a single nucleotide change of a valine to a leucine within the transmembrane domain of type 3 neuregulin 1.  it is thought that this single nucleotide change affects the ability of γ-secretase to cleave the intracellular domain (icd) of the type 3 isoform of neureglin 1.  that is, the valine to leucine mutation within the transmembrane domain of type 3 neuregulin 1 decreases the amount of icd that γ-secretase is able to cleave. the icd of type 3 neuregulin 1 has been shown to suppress transcription of inflammatory cytokines, including il-1β, il-6, il-10, il-8, il12-p70, and tnf-α.  using recombinant erbb4 to stimulate the cleavage of the intracellular domain of type 3 neuregulin 1, a receptor for type 3 neuregulin 1, marballi et al. showed that increased levels of the icd lead to a decrease in il-6 levels.  given the involvement of neuregulin 1 in schizophrenia and the finding that the valine to leucine missense mutation in mice produces working memory deficits, nrg1 seems a likely genetic candidate that confers susceptibility to the development of schizophrenia.

north carolina highway 9,non_science,"north carolina highway 9 (nc 9) is a 46.4-mile (74.7 km) primary state highway in the u.s. state of north carolina. it serves as a connector route from south carolina highway 9 to eastern portions of the appalachians around asheville.


== route description ==
nc 9 meets sc 9 at the state border. sc 9 is one of south carolina's most important state highways, although it is less so in north carolina. nc 9 begins in polk county south of the green creek community.
nc 9 is co-signed with us 64/74a in the city of lake lure. this is about 20 miles (32 km) north of the southern terminus.
after crossing into buncombe county nc 9 crosses over the eastern continental divide at lakey gap and crosses i-40 at exit 64.
the 18-mile (29 km) stretch of nc 9 from bat cave north to black mountain has been designated as a north carolina scenic highway.  it is known as the sidewinder in the motorcycle community, many scenic and curvy roads in the nc mountains have nicknames, as well. in addition to the scenery, it is a hilly and twisty route with some steep grades. a sign heading south from black mountain points out that heavy trucks are prohibited.
the highway runs through the town of black mountain (15 miles (24 km) east of asheville). nearly 3 miles (4.8 km) after crossing i-40, nc 9 ends at the vaulted archway entrance to the town of montreat.


== history ==
1930-1937: there was a previous nc 9 before the current day routing and was known as leesville road. the first 9 dates from about 1930, and ran from raleigh northwest to durham. today, part of that road is u.s. 70. it ran in conjunction with us 15a through downtown raleigh in front of the capitol building. the original nc 9 lasted until late 1937, when it was renumbered as us 70a.
1938: nc 9 in raleigh is renumbered, while nc 192 is renumbered to nc 9 from the sc border to lake lure, and renumbering nc 119 from chimney rock park (just north of lake lure) area north to montreat. the number was chosen because of the sc 9 renumbering in early 1938.
1972: an i-40-related rerouting just south of downtown black mountain in 1972. in the years before the interstate was built 9 entered town along black mountain avenue, proceeding east onto sutton avenue before continuing north on broadway street. with the completion of i-40, nc 9 followed an extension of broadway street. this is the last major change.


=== north carolina highway 192 (1928-1937) ===

the first north carolina highway 192 (nc 192) was established as a new primary routing between nc 19, in mill spring, and us 74/nc 20, in lake lure. in 1931, nc 192 was extended southeast from mill spring along new primary routing to the south carolina state line, where it continued as sc 177 towards spartanburg. in late 1937, part of the renumbering effort for contiguous routes with south carolina, nc 192 was redesignated as nc 9 to match sc 9, which replaced sc 177 the year prior.

list of high commissioners of new zealand to singapore,non_science,"the high commissioner from new zealand to singapore is new zealand's foremost diplomatic representative in the republic of singapore, and in charge of new zealand's diplomatic mission in singapore.
the high commission is located on orchard road, in the heart of singapore's central area.  new zealand has maintained a resident high commissioner in singapore since singapore's independence in 1965, and a resident head of mission since 1955.  the high commissioner to singapore is concurrently accredited to the maldives.
as fellow members of the commonwealth of nations, diplomatic relations between new zealand and singapore are at governmental level, rather than between heads of state.  thus, the countries exchange high commissioners, rather than ambassadors.
between 1963 and 1965, singapore was a member state of malaysia.  during that period, the diplomatic mission to singapore was subsumed by the greater mission to malaysia; the high commissioner to malaysia was hunter wade.  however, new zealand maintained its commission in singapore, under the supervision of a deputy high commissioner, brian lendrum.

concert for freedom,non_science,"the concert for freedom was a concert held at camp nou football stadium in barcelona on 29 june 2013, organized by òmnium cultural in conjunction with other civil society organization such as the assemblea nacional catalana and the plataforma pro seleccions esportives catalanes with the goal using the universal language of music to demand the right of catalonia and other nations of the world to freely and democratically decide their future. some 90,000 people were in attendance. between the 2012 catalan independence demonstration and the catalan way, the concert was another social mobilization event in favor of independence. more than 400 artists performed, among them lluís llach, sopa de cabra, miquel gil, pastora, joana serrat, jofre bardagí, jordi batiste, lídia pujol, maria del mar bonet, marina rossell, mercedes peón, nena venetsanou, orfeó català, paco ibáñez, pascal comelade,  pau alabajos, pep sala, peret, projecte mut, sabor de gràcia, ferran piqué, joan enric barceló & eduard costa from els amics de les arts, and brams. the artistic directors were gerard quintana and lluís danés, who was in charge of set design. the stage featured various steps symbolizing the path toward freedom.also present at camp nou were nine members of the catalan government and representatives from the majority of catalan political parties that support catalonia's right to self-determination. muriel casals, the president of òmnium cultural, gave a speech affirming that ""catalonia's independence movement is not against anyone or anything"" and requesting that politicians not delay the process toward a referendum.


== background ==
concert tickets went on sale on monday, 3 june and almost all (60,000) were sold the same day, with online wait times to purchase tickets that exceeded six hours. this caused the organization to initially freeze ticket sales  and then release 30,000 tickets for sale on the 17th, though these were for seats at the south goal post of the stadium, behind the stage.when the singer dyango announced his participation in the concert for freedom, some spaniards were outraged. dyango was not intimidated by the attitudes of the hosts on 13 tv, an ecclesiastic television channel that is one of the stalwarts of spanish nationalism, in the face of his support for separatism. he affirmed that the current goal is to hold a catalan referendum, and ultimately achieve full separation from spain. peret also denounced pressure and threats he has received for participating in the concert.singer-songwriter from the canary islands, pedro guerra, cancelled his participation in the concert alleging that the event had veered toward ""purely separatist motivations that he doesn't share"" and that ""this is not his fight,"" while affirming that he was not pressured into withdrawing. singer mayte martín also withdrew at the last minute for similar motives.


== program ==

before the concert an information fair was set up outside camp nou and the local food bank established collection points to benefit the needy, collecting a total of 25 tons of food.the event was divided in two halves. in the first half, various artists interpreted songs related to freedom and popular catalan tunes such as ""l'emigrant"" (the emigrant) sung by peret; ""què volen aquesta gent?"" (what do these people want?) sung by maría del mar bonet and companyia elèctrica dharma, and ""camins"" (paths) sung by sopa de cabra. the second half featured songs by lluís llach sung both by the artist himself and other artists such as orfeó català, perros, ramoncín, pastora and miquel gil, in homage to llach's concert at camp nou in 1985, remembered as a protest in supports of the rights of the catalan nation. at halftime, the castellers de vilafranca orchestrated a 9 level high human tower called a 3 de 9 amb folre and they played the catalan national anthem ""els segadors,"" while forming a giant mosaic reading ""freedom catalonia 2014."" during the first half, readings were performed between songs by cristina plazas, anna sahun, bonaventura clotet, manel esteller, miquel casas, pere joan cardona, alícia casals, isona passola, ventura pons, joel joan, jordi díaz, josep pedrals, lluís soler, màrius serra, matthew tree, montserrat carulla, núria feliu, quim masferrer, roger coma and sílvia bel.
readings were written by bertolt brecht, dolors miquel, enric casasses, jacint verdaguer (la veu del montseny), joan margarit, joana raspall (el vell vestit), maria àngels anglada, marià villangómez, miquel martí i pol, montserrat abelló, salvador espriu (el meu poble i jo), vicent andrés estellés, joan brossa, josep maria de sagarra (la campana de sant honorat).


== international reception ==
the concert for freedom was covered by several international media agencies (such as reuters and the associated press) and various newspapers, television and radio stations from france, germany, italy, poland, the netherlands, portugal, etc. one of the most talked-about images from the event by the media was the mosaic that unfolded in the stands during the playing of the national anthem of catalonia.among the articles covering the event were:

the nobodies (song),non_science,"""the nobodies"" is a song by american rock band marilyn manson. it is the third and final single from their fourth studio album, holy wood (in the shadow of the valley of death), released in 2000. the song addresses eric harris and dylan klebold, perpetrators of the columbine high school massacre in 1999. the song's title is from a quote by john lennon's murderer, mark david chapman, who once lamented that he ""felt like a nobody.""as early as february 10, 2001, manson had made indications that the song would be chosen as the album's third single. the third single was released in physical format on september 3, 2001 in the uk, and on october 6, 2001 in the us.a remixed version of the song would later appear in the 2001 johnny depp film from hell. also, despite its usage of harsh vocals, the band has performed an acoustic version of the song.
in 2016 both the holy wood original and 2005 against all gods mix versions of the song were used by tna professional wrestling stable decay (abyss, crazzy steve, and rosemary), the original version as arena entrance music and the against all gods mix for taped music video vignettes.

== music video ==
the music video for ""the nobodies"" was directed by paul fedor. it premiered on mtv in june 2001. technical presentation of the video uses shaking camera techniques, varying perspective shots, closeups, and fast scene shot changes.originally, the frontman expressed desire to film the music video in russia ""because the atmosphere, the desolation, the coldness, and the architecture would really suit the song."" another concept called for the incorporation of the mtv stunt and prank reality tv series, jackass, due to the song's inclusion in the jackass soundtrack. however, this idea was abandoned after the show began drawing the ire of u.s. senator joseph lieberman (d-conn.), who was among the politicians who targeted marilyn manson for blame after the columbine high school massacre. marilyn manson explained the idea for the music video:

i already had a story for the video that i wanted to do, a sort of marilyn manson fairy tale about some children escaping from an orphanage and seeking refuge with me after fleeing from some terrible, evil nuns who abused them—as all nuns do, i guess. so i decided that they would be watching jackass on television and the nuns would be upset with them, which is why they'd leave. but now i don't know what they'll be watching [...] maybe joseph lieberman—that might be the most appropriate thing.


== the columbine connection ==
the lyrics refer to eric harris and dylan klebold, the shooters of the april 20, 1999 columbine high school massacre. manson references the media coverage in the aftermath of the killings, singing ""some children died the other day / we fed machines and then we prayed / puked up and down in morbid faith / you should have seen the ratings that day.""after the shootings, the media widely reported that listening to manson's music drove the boys to kill, though in fact they didn't appear to be fans of the band. an interview with him about the columbine shootings was featured in the 2002 michael moore documentary bowling for columbine. when moore asked what he would say to shooters harris and klebold, manson replied, ""i wouldn't say anything to them. i would listen to what they have to say and that's what no one did."" also in the film, an acoustic instrumental version of the song is played during a montage of security camera footage and emergency phone calls.


== chart positions ==


== against all gods mix ==
""the nobodies: 2005 against all gods mix"" was released in europe as the second single and in asia as an ep in conjunction with marilyn manson's against all gods world tour, and to radio in the united states in conjunction with the compilation album, lest we forget: the best of; only the original album version is present on the compilation.

"dominion hotel, toronto",non_science,"the dominion hotel is a restaurant and former hotel in toronto, ontario, canada. constructed in the late nineteenth century in the corktown neighbourhood, it is a heritage hotel structure that has not been torn down and replaced with a modern structure. the structure is a designated heritage property.the hotel was constructed in 1889. its first owner was robert t. davies, who founded the dominion brewery to the west of the building (now dominion square) in 1877. davies had previously been the manager of the nearby don brewery, owned by his relative thomas davies.as originally constructed, the hotel was four stories tall, had a mansard roof, and a small tower.
the top floor, once ""boasted an elegant performance space"". sometime after 1945, the structure lost its fourth floor, mansard roof and tower. the hotel re-opened in 1998 as a bar.the bar closed in 2014 for renovation work. in mid-2015, fab restaurant concepts purchased the bar and on november 31, 2015 it was re-opened as the dominion pub & kitchen. the upper floors are used as a rooming house of 25 units.

gtpase hras isoform 1 (human),protein,"ras is a family of related proteins which is expressed in all animal cell lineages and organs. all ras protein family members belong to a class of protein called small gtpase, and are involved in transmitting signals within cells (cellular signal transduction). ras is the prototypical member of the ras superfamily of proteins, which are all related in 3d structure and regulate diverse cell behaviours.
when ras is 'switched on' by incoming signals, it subsequently switches on other proteins, which ultimately turn on genes involved in cell growth, differentiation and survival. mutations in ras genes can lead to the production of permanently activated ras proteins. as a result, this can cause unintended and overactive signaling inside the cell, even in the absence of incoming signals.
because these signals result in cell growth and division, overactive ras signaling can ultimately lead to cancer. the 3 ras genes in humans (hras, kras, and nras) are the most common oncogenes in human cancer; mutations that permanently activate ras are found in 20% to 25% of all human tumors and up to 90% in certain types of cancer (e.g., pancreatic cancer). for this reason, ras inhibitors are being studied as a treatment for cancer and other diseases with ras overexpression.


== history ==
the first two ras genes, hras and kras, were identified from studies of two cancer-causing viruses, the harvey sarcoma virus and kirsten sarcoma virus, by edward m. scolnick and colleagues at the national institutes of health (nih).  these viruses were discovered originally in rats during the 1960s by jennifer harvey and werner h. kirsten, respectively, hence the name rat sarcoma. in 1982, activated and transforming human ras genes were discovered in human cancer cells by geoffrey m. cooper at harvard, mariano barbacid and stuart a. aaronson at the nih, robert weinberg at mit, and michael wigler at cold spring harbor laboratory. a third ras gene was subsequently discovered by researchers in the group of robin weiss at the institute of cancer research, and michael wigler at cold spring harbor laboratory, named  nras, for its initial identification in human neuroblastoma cells.
the three human ras genes encode extremely similar proteins made up of chains of 188 to 189 amino acids.  their gene symbols are hras, nras and kras, the latter of which produces the k-ras4a and k-ras4b isoforms from alternative splicing.


== structure ==

ras contains six beta strands and five alpha helices.
it consists of two domains: a g domain of 166 amino acids (about 20 kda) that binds guanosine nucleotides, and a c-terminal membrane targeting region (caax-cooh, also known as caax box), which is lipid-modified by farnesyl transferase, rce1, and icmt.
the g domain contains five g motifs that bind gdp/gtp directly.
the g1 motif, or the p-loop, binds the beta phosphate of gdp and gtp.
the g2 motif, also called switch i, contains threonine35, which binds the terminal phosphate (γ-phosphate) of gtp and the divalent magnesium ion bound in the active site.  
the g3 motif, also called switch ii, has a dxxgq motif. the d is aspartate57, which is specific for guanine versus adenine binding, and q is glutamine61, the crucial residue that activates a catalytic water molecule for hydrolysis of gtp to gdp.
the g4 motif contains a lvgnkxdl motif, and provides specific interaction to guanine.
the g5 motif contains a sak consensus sequence. the a is alanine146, which provides specificity for guanine rather than adenine.
the two switch motifs, g2 and g3, are the main parts of the protein that move upon activation by gtp. this conformational change by the two switch motifs is what mediates the basic functionality as a molecular switch protein. this gtp-bound state of ras is the ""on"" state, and the gdp-bound state is the ""off"" state.
ras also binds a magnesium ion which helps to coordinate nucleotide binding.


== function ==

ras proteins function as binary molecular switches that control intracellular signaling networks. ras-regulated signal pathways control such processes as actin cytoskeletal integrity, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell adhesion, apoptosis, and cell migration. ras and ras-related proteins are often deregulated in cancers, leading to increased invasion and metastasis, and decreased apoptosis.

ras activates several pathways, of which the mitogen-activated protein (map) kinase cascade has been well-studied. this cascade transmits signals downstream and results in the transcription of genes involved in cell growth and division. another ras-activated signaling pathway is the pi3k/akt/mtor pathway, which stimulates protein synthesis and cellular growth, and inhibits apoptosis.


=== activation and deactivation ===
ras is a guanosine-nucleotide-binding protein. specifically, it is a single-subunit small gtpase, which is related in structure to the gα subunit of heterotrimeric g proteins (large gtpases). g proteins function as binary signaling switches with ""on"" and ""off"" states. in the ""off"" state it is bound to the nucleotide guanosine diphosphate (gdp), while in the ""on"" state, ras is bound to guanosine triphosphate (gtp), which has an extra phosphate group as compared to gdp. this extra phosphate holds the two switch regions in a ""loaded-spring"" configuration (specifically the thr-35 and gly-60). when released, the switch regions relax which causes a conformational change into the inactive state. hence, activation and deactivation of ras and other small g proteins are controlled by cycling between the active gtp-bound and inactive gdp-bound forms.
the process of exchanging the bound nucleotide is facilitated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (gefs) and gtpase activating proteins (gaps). as per its classification, ras has an intrinsic gtpase activity, which means that the protein on its own will hydrolyze a bound gtp molecule into gdp. however this process is too slow for efficient function, and hence the gap for ras, rasgap, may bind to and stabilize the catalytic machinery of ras, supplying additional catalytic residues (""arginine finger"") such that a water molecule is optimally positioned for nucleophilic attack on the gamma-phosphate of gtp. an inorganic phosphate is released and the ras molecule is now bound to a gdp. since the gdp-bound form is ""off"" or ""inactive"" for signaling, gtpase activating protein inactivates ras by activating its gtpase activity. thus, gaps accelerate ras inactivation.
gefs catalyze a ""push and pull"" reaction which releases gdp from ras. they insert close to the p-loop and magnesium cation binding site and inhibit the interaction of these with the gamma phosphate anion. acidic (negative) residues in switch ii ""pull"" a lysine in the p-loop away from the gdp which ""pushes"" switch i away from the guanine. the contacts holding gdp in place are broken and it is released into the cytoplasm. because intracellular gtp is abundant relative to gdp (approximately 10 fold more) gtp predominantly re-enters the nucleotide binding pocket of ras and reloads the spring. thus gefs facilitate ras activation. well known gefs include son of sevenless (sos) and cdc25 which include the rasgef domain.
the balance between gef and gap activity determines the guanine nucleotide status of ras, thereby regulating ras activity.
in the gtp-bound conformation, ras has a high affinity for numerous effectors which allow it to carry out its functions. these include pi3k. other small gtpases may bind adaptors such as arfaptin or second messenger systems such as adenylyl cyclase. the ras binding domain is found in many effectors and invariably binds to one of the switch regions, because these change conformation between the active and inactive forms. however, they may also bind to the rest of the protein surface.
other proteins exist that may change the activity of ras family proteins. one example is gdi (gdp disassociation inhibitor). these function by slowing the exchange of gdp for gtp,  thus prolonging the inactive state of ras family members. other proteins that augment this cycle may exist.


=== membrane attachment ===
ras is attached to the cell membrane owing to its prenylation and palmitoylation (hras and nras) or the combination of prenylation and a polybasic sequence adjacent to the prenylation site (kras). the c-terminal caax box of ras first gets farnesylated at its cys residue in the cytosol, allowing ras to loosely insert into the membrane of the endoplasmatic reticulum and other cellular membranes. the tripeptide (aax) is then cleaved from the c-terminus by a specific prenyl-protein specific endoprotease and the new c-terminus is methylated by a methyltransferase. kras processing is completed at this stage.  dynamic electrostatic interactions between its positively charged basic sequence with negative charges at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane account for its predominant localization at the cell surface at steady-state. nras and hras are further processed on the surface of the golgi apparatus by palmitoylation of one or two cys residues, respectively, adjacent to the caax box. the proteins thereby become stably membrane anchored (lipid-rafts) and are transported to the plasma membrane on vesicles of the secretory pathway. depalmitoylation by acyl-protein thioesterases eventually releases the proteins from the membrane, allowing them to enter another cycle of palmitoylation and depalmitoylation. this cycle is believed to prevent the leakage of nras and hras to other membranes over time and to maintain their steady-state localization along the golgi apparatus, secretory pathway, plasma membrane and inter-linked endocytosis pathway.


== members ==
the clinically most notable members of the ras subfamily are hras, kras and nras, mainly for being implicated in many types of cancer.however, there are many other members of this subfamily as well:diras1; diras2; diras3; eras; gem; mras; nkiras1; nkiras2; nras; rala; ralb; rap1a; rap1b; rap2a; rap2b; rap2c; rasd1; rasd2; rasl10a; rasl10b; rasl11a; rasl11b; rasl12; rem1; rem2; rerg; rergl; rrad; rras; rras2


== ras in cancer ==
mutations in the ras family of proto-oncogenes (comprising h-ras, n-ras and k-ras) are very common, being found in 20% to 30% of all human tumors. it is reasonable to speculate that a pharmacological approach that curtails ras activity may represent a possible method to inhibit certain cancer types. ras point mutations are the single most common abnormality of human proto-oncogenes.ras inhibitor trans-farnesylthiosalicylic acid (fts, salirasib) exhibits profound anti-oncogenic effects in many cancer cell lines.


=== inappropriate activation ===
inappropriate activation of the gene has been shown to play a key role in improper signal transduction, proliferation and malignant transformation.mutations in a number of different genes as well as ras itself can have this effect. oncogenes such as p210bcr-abl or the growth receptor erbb are upstream of ras, so if they are constitutively activated their signals will transduce through ras.
the tumour suppressor gene nf1 encodes a ras-gap – its mutation in neurofibromatosis will mean that ras is less likely to be inactivated. ras can also be amplified, although this only occurs occasionally in tumours.
finally, ras oncogenes can be activated by point mutations so that the gtpase reaction can no longer be stimulated by gap – this increases the half life of active ras-gtp mutants.


=== constitutively active ras ===
constitutively active ras (rasd) is one which contains mutations that prevent gtp hydrolysis, thus locking ras in a permanently 'on' state.
the most common mutations are found at residue g12 in the p-loop and the catalytic residue q61.

the glycine to valine mutation at residue 12 renders the gtpase domain of ras insensitive to inactivation by gap and thus stuck in the ""on state"".  ras requires a gap for inactivation as it is a relatively poor catalyst on its own, as opposed to other g-domain-containing proteins such as the alpha subunit of heterotrimeric g proteins.
residue 61 is responsible for stabilizing the transition state for gtp hydrolysis.  because enzyme catalysis in general is achieved by lowering the energy barrier between substrate and product, mutation of q61 to k (glutamine to lysine) necessarily reduces the rate of intrinsic ras gtp hydrolysis to physiologically meaningless levels.see also ""dominant negative"" mutants such as s17n and d119n.


=== ras-targeted cancer treatments ===
reovirus was noted to be a potential cancer therapeutic when studies suggested it reproduces well in certain cancer cell lines. it replicates specifically in cells that have an activated ras pathway (a cellular signaling pathway that is involved in cell growth and differentiation). reovirus replicates in and eventually kills ras-activated tumour cells and as cell death occurs, progeny virus particles are free to infect surrounding cancer cells. this cycle of infection, replication and cell death is believed to be repeated until all tumour cells carrying an activated ras pathway are destroyed.
another tumor-lysing virus that specifically targets tumor cells with an activated ras pathway is a type ii herpes simplex virus (hsv-2) based agent, designated fuson-h2. activating mutations of the ras protein and upstream elements of the ras protein may play a role in more than two-thirds of all human cancers, including most metastatic disease. reolysin, a formulation of reovirus, and fuson-h2 are currently in clinical trials or under development for the treatment of various cancers. in addition, a treatment based on sirna anti-mutated k-ras (g12d) called sig12d loder is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer (nct01188785, nct01676259).in glioblastoma mouse models shp2 levels were heightened in cancerous brain cells. inhibiting shp2 in turn inhibited ras dephosphorylation. this reduced tumor sizes and accompanying rise in survival rates.other strategies have attempted to manipulate the regulation of the above-mentioned localization of ras. farnesyltransferase inhibitors have been developed to stop the farnesylation of ras and therefore weaken its affinity to membranes. other inhibitors are targeting the palmitoylation cycle of ras through inhibiting depalmitoylation by acyl-protein thioesterases, potentially leading to a destabilization of the ras cycle.

asn-trp-trp,reagent,"enfuvirtide (inn) is an hiv fusion inhibitor, the first of a class of antiretroviral drugs used in combination therapy for the treatment of hiv-1 infection. it is marketed under the trade name fuzeon (roche).


== structural formula ==

ac-tyr-thr-ser-leu-ile-his-ser-leu-ile-glu-glu-ser-gln-asn-gln-gln-glu-lys-asn-glu-gln-glu-leu-leu-glu-leu-asp-lys-trp-ala-ser-leu-trp-asn-trp-phe-nh2


== history ==
enfuvirtide originated at duke university, where researchers formed a pharmaceutical company known as trimeris.  trimeris began development on enfuvirtide in 1996 and initially designated it t-20. in 1999, trimeris entered into partnership with hoffmann-la roche to complete the development of the drug. it was approved by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) on march 13, 2003 as the first hiv fusion inhibitor, a new class of antiretroviral drugs. it was approved on the basis of two studies which compared the effect of optimized regimens of antiretroviral medication with and without the addition of enfuvirtide on serum viral load.


== pharmacology ==


=== mechanism of action ===
enfuvirtide works by disrupting the hiv-1 molecular machinery at the final stage of fusion with the target cell, preventing uninfected cells from becoming infected. a biomimetic peptide, enfuvirtide was designed to mimic components of the hiv-1 fusion machinery and displace them, preventing normal fusion. drugs that disrupt fusion of virus and target cell are termed entry inhibitors or fusion inhibitors.
hiv binds to the host cd4+ cell receptor via the viral protein gp120; gp41, a viral transmembrane protein, then undergoes a conformational change that assists in the fusion of the viral membrane to the host cell membrane. enfuvirtide binds to gp41 preventing the creation of an entry pore for the capsid of the virus, keeping it out of the cell.enfuvirtide is also an activator of the chemotactic factor receptor, formyl peptide receptor 1, and thereby activates phagocytes and presumably other cells bearing this receptor (see formyl peptide receptors).  the physiological significance of this activation is unknown.


=== microbiology ===
enfuvirtide is considered to be active against hiv-1 only. low activity against hiv-2 isolates has been demonstrated in vitro.variable susceptibility to enfuvirtide has been observed in clinical isolates, with acquired resistance the result of a mutated 10 amino acid motif in viral gp41. primary resistance, however, has yet to be observed.


== clinical use ==


=== indications ===
enfuvirtide is indicated for the treatment of hiv-1 infection, in combination therapy with other antiretrovirals, in patients where all other treatments have failed.


=== dosage forms ===
by virtue of its peptide nature, enfuvirtide is marketed in injectable form. the lyophilised enfuvirtide powder must be reconstituted by the patient and administered twice daily by subcutaneous injection. due to the chronic nature of this kind of therapy, this dosage form may be a major problem for the patient's adherence to this drug regimen.


=== adverse effects ===
common adverse drug reactions (≥1% of patients) associated with enfuvirtide therapy include: injection site reactions (pain, hardening of skin, erythema, nodules, cysts, itch; experienced by nearly all patients, particularly in the first week), peripheral neuropathy, insomnia, depression, cough, dyspnoea, anorexia, arthralgia, infections (including bacterial pneumonia) and/or eosinophilia. various hypersensitivity reactions occur infrequently (0.1–1% of patients), symptoms of which include rash, fever, nausea, vomiting, chills, rigors, hypotension, elevated hepatic transaminases; and possibly more severe reactions including respiratory distress, glomerulonephritis and/or anaphylaxis – rechallenge is not recommended.


== society and culture ==


=== economics ===
enfuvirtide therapy costs an estimated us$25,000 per year in the united states. its cost and inconvenient dosing regimen are factors behind its use as a reserve, for salvage therapy in patients with multi-drug resistant hiv.

ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 2 isoform 1,protein,"phosphofructokinase-2 (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, pfk-2) or fructose bisphosphatase-2 (fbpase-2), is an enzyme indirectly responsible for regulating the rates of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in cells. it catalyzes formation and degradation of a significant allosteric regulator, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (fru-2,6-p2) from substrate fructose-6-phosphate. fru-2,6-p2 contributes to the rate-determining step of glycolysis as it activates enzyme phosphofructokinase 1 in the glycolysis pathway, and inhibits fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 in gluconeogenesis. since fru-2,6-p2 differentially regulates glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, it can act as a key signal to switch between the opposing pathways. because pfk-2 produces fru-2,6-p2 in response to hormonal signaling, metabolism can be more sensitively and efficiently controlled to align with the organism's glycolytic needs.this enzyme participates in fructose and mannose metabolism.  the enzyme is important in the regulation of hepatic carbohydrate metabolism and is found in greatest quantities in the liver, kidney and heart. in mammals, several genes often encode different isoforms, each of which differs in its tissue distribution and enzymatic activity. the family described here bears a resemblance to the atp-driven phospho-fructokinases, however, they share little sequence similarity, although a few residues seem key to their interaction with fructose 6-phosphate.pfk-2 is known as the ""bifunctional enzyme"" because of its notable structure: though both are located on one protein homodimer, its two domains act as independently functioning enzymes. one terminus serves as a kinase domain (for pfk-2) while the other terminus acts as a phosphatase domain (fbpase-2).in mammals, genetic mechanisms encode different pfk-2 isoforms to accommodate tissue specific needs. while general function remains the same, isoforms feature slight differences in enzymatic properties and are controlled by different methods of regulation; these differences are discussed below.


== structure ==
the monomers of the bifunctional protein are clearly divided into two functional domains. the kinase domain is located on the n-terminal. it consists of a central six-stranded β sheet, with five parallel strands and an antiparallel edge strand, surrounded by seven α helices. the domain contains nucleotide-binding fold (nbf) at the c-terminal end of the first β-strand. the pfk-2 domain appears to be closely related to the superfamily of mononucleotide binding proteins including adenylate cyclase.on the other hand, the phosphatase domain is located on the c-terminal. it resembles the family of proteins that include phosphoglycerate mutases and acid phosphatases. the domain has a mixed α/ β structure, with a six-stranded central β sheet, plus an additional α-helical subdomain that covers the presumed active site of the molecule. finally, the n-terminal region modulates pfk-2 and fbpase2 activities, and stabilizes the dimer form of the enzyme.while this central catalytic core remains conserved in all forms of pfk-2, slight structural variations exist in isoforms as a result of different amino acid sequences or alternative splicing. with some minor exceptions, the size of pfk-2 enzymes is typically around 55 kda.researchers hypothesize that the unique bifunctional structure of this enzyme arose from a gene fusion event between a primordial bacterial pfk-1 and a primordial mutase/phosphatase.


== function ==
this enzyme's main function is to synthesize or degrade allosteric regulator fru-2,6-p2 in response to glycolytic needs of the cell or organism, as depicted in the accompanying diagram.
in enzymology, a 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (ec 2.7.1.105) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction:

atp + beta-d-fructose 6-phosphate 
  
    
      
        ⇌
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rightleftharpoons }
   adp + beta-d-fructose 2,6-bisphosphatethus, the kinase domain hydrolyzes atp to phosphorylate the carbon-2 of fructose-6-phosphate, producing fru-2,6-p2 and adp. a phosphohistidine intermediate is formed within the reaction.
at the other terminal, the fructose-2,6-bisphosphate 2-phosphatase (ec 3.1.3.46) domain dephosphorylates fru-2,6-p2 with the addition of water. this opposing chemical reaction is:
beta-d-fructose 2,6-bisphosphate + h2o 
  
    
      
        ⇌
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rightleftharpoons }
    d-fructose 6-phosphate + phosphate
because of the enzyme's dual functions, it can be categorized into multiple families. through categorization by the kinase reaction, this enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with an alcohol group as acceptor. on the other hand, the phosphatase reaction is characteristic of the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds.

in almost all isoforms, pfk-2 undergoes covalent modification through phosphorylation/dephosphorylation based on the cell's hormonal signaling. phosphorylation of a specific residue may prompt a shift that stabilizes either kinase or phosphatase domain function. this regulation signal thus controls whether f-2,6-p2 will be synthesized or degraded.furthermore, the allosteric regulation of pfk2 is very similar to the regulation of pfk1. high levels of amp or phosphate group signifies a low energy charge state and thus stimulates pfk2. on the other hand, a high concentration of phosphoenolpyruvate(pep) and citrate signifies that there is a high level of biosynthetic precursor and hence inhibits pfk2. unlike pfk1, pfk2 is not affected by atp concentration.


== isozymes ==
protein isozymes are enzymes that catalyze the same reaction but are encoded with different amino acid sequences and as such, display slight differences in protein characteristics. in humans, the four genes that encode phosphofructokinase 2 proteins include pfkfb-1, pfkfb2, pfkfb3 and pfkfb4.multiple mammalian isoforms of the protein have been reported to date, difference rising by either the transcription of different enzymes or alternative splicing. while the structural core that catalyzes the pfk-2/fbpase-2 reaction is highly conserved across isoforms, the major differences arise from highly variable flanking sequences in the isoform amino and carboxyl terminals. because these areas often contain phosphorylation sites, changes in amino acid composition or terminal length may result in vastly different enzyme kinetics and characteristics. each variant differs in their primary tissue of expression, response to protein kinase regulation, and ratio of kinase/phosphatase domain activity. while multiple types of isozymes may consist in a tissue, isozymes are identified by their primary tissue expression and tissue of discovery below.


=== pfkb1: liver, muscle, and fetal ===
located on the x chromosome, this gene is the most well-known of the four genes particularly because it encodes the highly researched liver enzyme. variable mrna splicing of pfkb1 yields three different promoters (l, m and f) and therefore, three tissue-specific variants that differ in regulation:
l-type: liver tissue
insulin activates liver pfk-2 function to indicate a high abundance of blood glucose is available for glycolysis. insulin activates a protein phosphatase which dephosphorylates the pfk-2 complex and causes favored pfk-2 activity. pfk-2 then increases production of f-2,6-p2. as this product allosterically activates pfk-1, it activates glycolysis and inhibits gluconeogenesis.
in contrast, glucagon increases fbpase-2 activity. at low blood glucose concentrations, glucagon triggers a camp signal cascade and in turn, protein kinase a (pka) phosphorylates serine 32 near the n-terminus. this inactivates the bifunctional enzyme's ability to act as a kinase and stabilizes the phosphatase activity. therefore, glucagon decreases concentrations of f-2,6-p2, slows rates of glycolysis, and stimulates the gluconeogenesis pathway.
m-type: skeletal muscle tissue; f-type: fibroblast and fetal tissuein contrast to most other pfk-2 tissues, pfk-2 in both skeletal muscle and fetal tissue is solely regulated by concentrations of fructose-6-phosphate. within their first exon, there are no regulatory sites that require phosphorylation/dephosphorylation to provoke a change in function. high concentrations of f-6-p will activate kinase function and increase rates of glycolysis, whereas low concentrations of f-6-p will stabilize phosphatase action.


=== pfkb2: cardiac (h-type) ===
the pfkb2 gene is located on chromosome 1. when greater concentrations of adrenaline and/or insulin hormone are circulated, a protein kinase a pathway is activated which phosphorylates either serine 466 or serine 483 in the c-terminus. alternatively, protein kinase b may also phosphorylate these regulatory sites, which are part of the fbpase-2 domain. when this serine residue is phosphorylated, fbpase-2 function is inactivated and greater pfk-2 activity is stabilized.


=== pfkb3: brain, placental, and inducible ===
pfkb3 is located on chromosome 10 and transcribes two major isoforms, inducible type and ubiquitous type. these forms differ in alternative splicing of exon 15 in their c-terminus. however, they are similar in that for both, glucagon activates a cyclic amp pathway; this results in protein kinase a, protein kinase c, or amp-activated protein kinase phosphorylating a regulatory residue on serine 461 in the c-terminus to stabilize pfk-2 kinase function. furthermore, both isoforms transcribed from this gene are noted for having a particularly high, dominant rate of kinase activity as indicated by a kinase/phosphatase activity ratio of 700 (whereas the liver, heart, and testis isozymes respectively have pfk-2/fbpase-2 ratios of 1.5, 80, and 4). therefore, pfkb3 in particular consistently produces large amounts of f-2,6-p2 and sustains high rates of glycolysis.
i-type: inducible
this isoform's name is a result of its increased expression in response to hypoxic stress; its formation is induced by lack of oxygen. this type is highly expressed in rapidly proliferating cells, especially tumor cells.
u-type: ubiquitous; also known as placental or brain
though discovered separately in the placental, pancreatic-β-islet, or brain tissues, the various isoforms appear identical. the tissues it was discovered in all require great energy to function, which may explain pfkb3's advantage of such high kinase-phosphatase activity ratio.
the brain isoform in particular has lengthy n- and c-terminus regions such that this type is almost twice as large as the typical pfk-2, at around 110 kda.


=== pfkb4: testis (t-type) ===
gene pfkb4, located on chromosome 3, expresses pfk-2 in human testis tissue. pfk-2 enzymes encoded by pfk-4 are comparable to the liver enzyme in size at around 54kda, and like the muscle tissue, do not contain a protein kinase phosphorylation site. while less research has clarified regulation mechanisms for this isoform, studies have confirmed that modification from multiple transcription factors in the 5' flanking region regulates the amount of pfk-2 expression in developing testis tissue. this isoform has been particularly implicated as being modified and hyper-expressed for prostate cancer cell survival.


== clinical significance ==
because this enzyme family maintains rates of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, it presents great potential for therapeutic action for control of metabolism particularly in diabetes and cancer cells. data also demonstrates that all of the pfk-2 genes (although the pfkb3 gene response remains the most drastic) were activated by limitations in oxygen. the control of pfk-2/fbp-ase2 activity was found to be linked to heart functioning, particularly for ischemia, and the control against hypoxia. researchers hypothesize that this responsive characteristic of the pfk-2 genes may be a strong, evolutionary physiological adaptation. however, many human cancer cell types (including leukemia, lung, breast, colon, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers) demonstrate over-expression of pfk3 and/or pfk4; this change in metabolism likely plays a role in the warburg effect.lastly, the pfkfb2 gene encoding pfk2/fbpase2 protein is linked to the predisposition to schizophrenia.

hexcer(d32:1),reagent,"diameter is an authentication, authorization, and accounting protocol for computer networks. it evolved from the earlier radius protocol. it belongs to the application layer protocols in the internet protocol suite.
diameter applications extend the base protocol by adding new commands and/or attributes, such as those for use with the extensible authentication protocol (eap).


== comparison with radius ==
the name is a play on words, derived from the radius protocol, which is the predecessor (a diameter is twice the radius). diameter is not directly backwards compatible but provides an upgrade path for radius. the main features provided by diameter but lacking in radius are:

support for sctp
capability negotiation
application layer acknowledgements; diameter defines failover methods and state machines (rfc 3539)
extensibility; new commands can be defined
aligned on 32 bit boundariesalso:
like radius, it is intended to work in both local and roaming aaa situations.
it uses tcp or sctp unlike radius which uses udp.
unlike radius it includes no encryption, but can be protected by transport level security (ipsec or tls).
the base size of the av identifier is 32 bit unlike radius which uses 8 bit as the base av identifier size.
like radius, it supports stateless as well as stateful modes.
like radius, it supports application layer acknowledgment and defines failover.
diameter is used for many different interfaces defined by the 3gpp standards, with each interface typically defining new commands and attributes.


== applications ==
a diameter application is not a software application but is a protocol based on the diameter base protocol defined in rfc 6733 and rfc 7075 (obsoletes: rfc 3588). each application is defined by an application identifier and can add new command codes and/or new mandatory avps (attribute-value pair). adding a new optional avp does not require a new application.
examples of diameter applications:

diameter mobile ipv4 application (mobileip, rfc 4004)
diameter network access server application (nasreq, rfc 7155)(obsoletes: rfc 4005)
diameter extensible authentication protocol application (rfc 4072)
diameter credit-control application (dcca, rfc 8506])(obsoletes: rfc 4006)
diameter session initiation protocol application (rfc 4740)
various applications in the 3gpp ip multimedia subsystemboth the hss and the slf communicate using the diameter protocol.(generic bootstrapping architecture): bootstrapping server function


== history ==
the diameter protocol was initially developed by pat r. calhoun, glen zorn, and ping pan in 1998 to provide a framework for  authentication, authorization and accounting (aaa) that could overcome the limitations of radius.  radius had issues with reliability, scalability, security and flexibility.  radius cannot deal effectively with remote access, ip mobility and policy control.  the diameter protocol defines a policy protocol used by clients to perform policy, aaa, and resource control. this allows a single server to handle policies for many services.like radius, diameter provides aaa functionality, but uses tcp and sctp instead of udp, therefore delegating detection and handling of communication problems to those protocols. the diameter protocol is enhanced further by the development of the 3rd generation partnership project (3gpp) ip multimedia subsystem (ims). the s6a, s6b, gx, gy, sy, rx, cx, dh, dx, rf, ro, sh and zh interfaces are supported by diameter applications.  through the use of extensions, the protocol was designed to be extensible to support proxies, brokers, strong security, mobile ip, network-access servers (nasreq), accounting and resource management.


== protocol description ==
the diameter base protocol is defined by rfc 6733 (obsoletes: rfc 3588 and rfc 5719) and defines the minimum requirements for an aaa protocol. diameter applications can extend the base protocol by adding new commands, attributes, or both. diameter security is provided by ipsec or tls. the iana has assigned tcp and sctp port number 3868 to diameter, as stated in section 11.4 of rfc 6733.


=== packet format ===
the packet consists of a diameter header and a variable number of attribute-value pairs, or avps, for encapsulating information relevant to the diameter message.


=== version ===
this field indicates the version of the diameter base protocol. as of 2014, the only value supported is 1.


=== message length ===
the message length field indicates the length of the diameter message in bytes, including the header fields and the padded avps.


=== command flags ===
the ""r"" (request) bit – if set, the message is a request. if cleared, the message is an answer.
the ""p"" (proxiable) bit – if set, the message may be proxied, relayed or redirected.  if cleared, the message must be locally processed.
the ""e"" (error) bit – if set, the message contains a protocol error, and the message will not conform to the ccf described for this command.  messages with the ""e""  bit set are commonly referred to as error messages. this bit must not be set in request messages.
the ""t"" (potentially re-transmitted message) bit – this flag is set after a link failover procedure, to aid the removal of duplicate requests.  it is  set when resending requests not yet acknowledged as an indication of a possible duplicate due to a link failure.


=== commands ===
each command request/answer pair is assigned a command code. whether it is the request or answer is identified via the ’r’ bit in the command flags field of the header.
the values 0-255 are reserved for radius backward compatibility.
the values 256-16777213 are for permanent, standard commands allocated by iana.
the values 16777214 and 16777215 (hex 0xfffffe and 0xffffff) are reserved for experimental and testing purposes.
a command code is used to determine the action that is to be taken for a particular message. some common diameter commands defined in the protocol (base and applications) are:


=== application-id ===
application-id is used to identify for which diameter application the message is applicable. the application can be an authentication application, an accounting application, or a vendor-specific application.
diameter agents conforming to a certain diameter extension publicize its support by including a specific value of in the auth-application-id attribute of the capabilities-exchange-request (cer) and capabilities-exchange-answer (cea) command.
the value of the application-id field in the header is the same as any relevant application-id avps contained in the message. for instance, the value of the application-id and of the auth-application-id attribute in the credit-control-request (ccr) and credit-control-answer (cca) command for the diameter credit-control application is 4.


=== hop-by-hop identifier ===
the hop-by-hop identifier is an unsigned 32-bit integer field (in network byte order) that is used to match the requests with their answers as the same value in the request is used in the response.
the diameter protocol requires that relaying and proxying agents maintain transaction state, which is used for failover purposes. transaction state implies that upon forwarding a request, its hop-by-hop identifier is saved; the field is replaced with a locally unique identifier, which is restored to its original value when the corresponding answer is received. the request’s state is released upon receipt of the answer. received answers that do not match a known hop-by-hop identifier are ignored by the diameter agent.
in case of redirecting agents, the hop-by-hop identifier is maintained in the header as the diameter agent responds with an answer message.


=== end-to-end identifier ===
the end-to-end identifier is an unsigned 32-bit integer field (in network byte order) that is used to detect duplicate messages along with the combination of the origin-host avp.
when creating a request, the end-to-end identifier is set to a locally unique value. the end-to-end identifier is not modified by diameter agents of any kind, and the same value in the corresponding request is used in the answer.


=== attribute-value pairs (avp) ===
for simplicity, avp flag ""v"" bit means vendor specific; ""m"" bit means mandatory; ""p"" bit means protected.
the ""v"" bit, known as the vendor-specific bit, indicates whether the optional vendor-id field is present in the avp header.  when set the avp code belongs to the specific vendor code address space.
the ""m"" bit, known as the mandatory bit, indicates whether support of the avp is required.  if an avp with the ""m"" bit set is received by a diameter client, server, proxy, or translation agent and either the avp or its value is unrecognized, the message must be rejected.  diameter relay and redirect agents must not reject messages with unrecognized avps.
the ""p"" bit indicates the need for encryption for end-to-end security.


=== state machines ===
the rfc 3588 defines a core state machine for maintaining connections between peers and processing messages. this is part of the basic protocol functionality and all stacks should support it and as such abstract from the connectivity related operations.

		
additionally, application specific state machines can be introduced either later or at a higher abstraction layer. the rfc 3588 defines an authorization and an accounting state machine.

		
		
		


=== message flows ===

the communication between two diameter peers starts with the establishment of a transport connection (tcp or sctp). the initiator then sends a capabilities-exchange-request (cer) to the other peer, which responds with a capabilities-exchange-answer (cea). for rfc3588 compliant peers tls (transport layer security) may optionally be negotiated. for rfc6733 compliant peers tls negotiation may optionally happen before the cer/cea.
the connection is then ready for exchanging application messages.
if no messages have been exchanged for some time either side may send a device-watchdog-request (dwr) and the other peer must respond with device-watchdog-answer.
either side may terminate the communication by sending a disconnect-peer-request (dpr) which the other peer must respond to with disconnect-peer-answer. after that the transport connection can be disconnected.

hydroxybutyric acid,reagent,"gamma-hydroxybutyric acid or γ-hydroxybutyric acid (ghb), also known as 4-hydroxybutanoic acid, is a naturally occurring neurotransmitter and a psychoactive drug. it is a precursor to gaba, glutamate, and glycine in certain brain areas.  it acts on the ghb receptor and is a weak agonist at the gabab receptor. ghb has been used in the medical setting as a general anesthetic and as a treatment for cataplexy, narcolepsy, and alcoholism. it is also used illegally as an intoxicant, as an athletic performance enhancer, as a date-rape drug, and as a recreational drug.
it is commonly used in the form of a salt, such as sodium γ-hydroxybutyrate (naghb, sodium oxybate, or xyrem) or potassium γ-hydroxybutyrate (kghb, potassium oxybate). ghb is also produced as a result of fermentation, and is found in small quantities in some beers and wines, beef and small citrus fruits.succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency is a disease that causes ghb to accumulate in the blood.


== medical use ==
ghb is used for medical purposes in the treatment of narcolepsy and, more rarely, alcoholism, although its use for alcoholism is not supported by evidence from randomized controlled trials. it is sometimes used off-label for the treatment of fibromyalgia. ghb is the active ingredient of the prescription medication sodium oxybate (xyrem). sodium oxybate is approved by u.s. food and drug administration  for the treatment of cataplexy associated with narcolepsy and excessive daytime sleepiness (eds) associated with narcolepsy.ghb has been shown to reliably increase slow-wave sleep and decrease the tendency for rem sleep in modified multiple sleep latency tests.


== recreational use ==

ghb is a central nervous system depressant used as an intoxicant. it has many street names. its effects have been described as comparable with ethanol (alcohol) and mdma use, such as euphoria, disinhibition, enhanced libido and empathogenic states. a review comparing ethanol to ghb concluded that the dangers of the two drugs were similar. at higher doses, ghb may induce nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, agitation, visual disturbances, depressed breathing, amnesia, unconsciousness, and death. one potential cause of death from ghb consumption is polydrug toxicity. co-administration with other cns depressants such as alcohol or benzodiazepines can result in an additive effect (potentiation), as they all bind to gamma-aminobutyric acid (or ""gaba"") receptor sites. the effects of ghb can last from 1.5 to 4 hours, or longer if large doses have been consumed. consuming ghb with alcohol  can cause respiratory arrest and vomiting in combination with unrousable sleep, which can lead to death.recreational doses of 1–2 g generally provide a feeling of euphoria, and larger doses create deleterious effects such as reduced motor function and drowsiness. the sodium salt of ghb has a salty taste. other salt forms such as calcium ghb and magnesium ghb have also been reported, but the sodium salt is by far the most common.
some prodrugs, such as γ-butyrolactone (gbl), convert to ghb in the stomach and blood stream. other prodrugs, such as 1,4-butanediol (1,4-b), have their own toxicity concerns. gbl and 1,4-b are normally found as pure liquids, but they can be mixed with other more harmful solvents when intended for industrial use (e.g. as paint stripper or varnish thinner).
ghb can be manufactured with little knowledge of chemistry, as it involves the mixing of its two precursors, gbl and an alkali hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide, to form the ghb salt. due to the ease of manufacture and the availability of its precursors, it is not usually produced in illicit laboratories like other synthetic drugs, but in private homes by low-level producers.
ghb is ""colourless and odourless"".a 2006 report commissioned by a uk parliamentary committee found the use of ghb to be less dangerous than tobacco and alcohol in physical harm, dependence and social harms.


=== party use ===
ghb has been used as a club drug, apparently starting in the 1990s, as small doses of ghb can act as a euphoriant and are believed to be aphrodisiac. slang terms for ghb include liquid ecstasy, lollipops, liquid x or liquid e due to its tendency to produce euphoria and sociability and its use in the dance party scene.by 2009 this use had diminished, possibly due to efforts to control distribution of ghb and its analogs, or to the narrow range of dosing and adverse effects of confusion, dizziness, blurred vision, hot/cold flushes, profuse sweating, vomiting, and loss of consciousness when overdosed.  the downward trend was still apparent in 2012.


=== sports and athletics ===
some athletes have used ghb or its analogs because of being marketed as anabolic agents, although there is no evidence that it builds muscle or improves performance.


== usage as a date-rape drug ==

ghb became known to the general public as a date-rape drug by the late 1990s. ghb is colourless and odorless and has been described as ""very easy to add to drinks"". when consumed, the victim will quickly feel groggy and sleepy and may become unconscious. upon recovery they may have an impaired ability to recall events that have occurred during the period of intoxication. in these situations evidence and the identification of the perpetrator of the rape is often difficult.it is also difficult to establish how often ghb is used to facilitate rape as it is difficult to detect in a urine sample after a day, and many victims may only recall the rape some time after its occurrence; however, a 2006 study suggested that there was ""no evidence to suggest widespread date rape drug use"" in the uk, and that less than 2% of cases involved ghb, while 17% involved cocaine, and a survey in the netherlands published in 2010 found that the proportion of drug-related rape where ghb was used appeared to be greatly overestimated by the media.there have been several high-profile cases of ghb as a date rape drug that received national attention in the united states. in early 1999, a 15-year-old girl, samantha reid of rockwood, michigan, died from ghb poisoning. reid's death inspired the legislation titled the ""hillory j. farias and samantha reid date-rape drug prohibition act of 2000"". this is the law that made ghb a schedule 1 controlled substance.ghb can be detected in hair. hair testing can be a useful tool in court cases or for the victim's own information. most over-the-counter urine test kits test only for date-rape drugs that are benzodiazepines, and ghb is not a benzodiazepine. to detect ghb in urine, the sample must be taken within four hours of ghb ingestion, and cannot be tested at home.


== adverse effects ==


=== combination with alcohol ===
in humans, ghb has been shown to reduce the elimination rate of alcohol. this may explain the respiratory arrest that has been reported after ingestion of both drugs. a review of the details of 194 deaths attributed to or related to ghb over a ten-year period found that most were from respiratory depression caused by interaction with alcohol or other drugs.


=== deaths ===
one publication has investigated 226 deaths attributed to ghb. of 226 deaths included, 213 had a cardiorespiratory arrest and 13 had fatal accidents. seventy-one deaths (34%) had no co-intoxicants. postmortem blood ghb was 18–4400 mg/l (median=347) in deaths negative for co-intoxicants.
one report has suggested that sodium oxybate overdose might be fatal, based on deaths of three patients who had been prescribed the drug. however, for two of the three cases, post-mortem ghb concentrations were 141 and 110 mg/l, which is within the expected range of concentrations for ghb after death, and the third case was a patient with a history of intentional drug overdose. the toxicity of ghb has been an issue in criminal trials, as in the death of felicia tang, where the defense argued that death was due to ghb, not murder.
ghb is produced in the body in very small amounts, and blood levels may climb after death to levels in the range of 30–50 mg/l. levels higher than this are found in ghb deaths. levels lower than this may be due to ghb or to postmortem endogenous elevations.


=== neurotoxicity ===
in multiple studies, ghb has been found to impair spatial memory, working memory, learning and memory in rats with chronic administration. these effects are associated with decreased nmda receptor expression in the cerebral cortex and possibly other areas as well. in addition, the neurotoxicity appears to be caused by oxidative stress.


=== addiction ===
although there have been reported fatalities due to ghb withdrawal, reports are inconclusive and further research is needed. a common problem is that ghb does not leave traces in the body after a short period of time, complicating diagnosis and research. addiction occurs when repeated drug use disrupts the normal balance of brain circuits that control rewards, memory and cognition, ultimately leading to compulsive drug taking.rats forced to consume massive doses of ghb will intermittently prefer ghb solution to water but, after experiments on rats, it was noted that ""no rat showed any sign of withdrawal when ghb was finally removed at the end of the 20-week period"" or during periods of voluntary abstinence.


=== withdrawal ===
ghb has also been associated with a withdrawal syndrome of insomnia, anxiety, and tremor that usually resolves within three to twenty-one days. the withdrawal syndrome can be severe producing acute delirium and may require hospitalization in an intensive care unit for management. management of ghb dependence involves considering the person's age, comorbidity and the pharmacological pathways of ghb. the mainstay of treatment for severe withdrawal is supportive care and benzodiazepines for control of acute delirium, but larger doses are often required compared to acute delirium of other causes (e.g. > 100 mg/d of diazepam). baclofen has been suggested as an alternative or adjunct to benzodiazepines based on anecdotal evidence and some animal data. however, there is less experience with the use of baclofen for ghb withdrawal, and additional research in humans is needed. baclofen was first suggested as an adjunct because benzodiazepines do not affect gabab receptors and therefore have no cross-tolerance with ghb while baclofen, which works via gabab receptors, is cross-tolerant with ghb and may be more effective in alleviating withdrawal effects of ghb.ghb withdrawal is not widely discussed in textbooks and some psychiatrists, general practitioners, and even hospital emergency physicians may not be familiar with this withdrawal syndrome.


== overdose ==
overdose of ghb can sometimes be difficult to treat because of its multiple effects on the body. ghb tends to cause rapid unconsciousness at doses above 3500 mg, with single doses over 7000 mg often causing life-threatening respiratory depression, and higher doses still inducing bradycardia and cardiac arrest. other side-effects include convulsions (especially when combined with stimulants), and nausea/vomiting (especially when combined with alcohol).the greatest life threat due to ghb overdose (with or without other substances) is respiratory arrest. other relatively common causes of death due to ghb ingestion include aspiration of vomitus, positional asphyxia, and trauma sustained while intoxicated (e.g., motor vehicle accidents while driving under the influence of ghb). the risk of aspiration pneumonia and positional asphyxia risk can be reduced by laying the patient down in the recovery position. people are most likely to vomit as they become unconscious, and as they wake up. it is important to keep the victim awake and moving; the victim must not be left alone due to the risk of death through vomiting. frequently the victim will be in a good mood but this does not mean the victim is not in danger. ghb overdose is a medical emergency and immediate assessment in an emergency department is needed.
convulsions from ghb can be treated with the benzodiazepines diazepam or lorazepam. even though these benzodiazepines are also cns depressants, they primarily modulate gabaa receptors whereas ghb is primarily a gabab receptor agonist, and so do not worsen cns depression as much as might be expected.because of the faster and more complete absorption of gbl relative to ghb, its dose-response curve is steeper, and overdoses of gbl tend to be more dangerous and problematic than overdoses involving only ghb or 1,4-b. any ghb/gbl overdose is a medical emergency and should be cared for by appropriately trained personnel.
a newer synthetic drug sch-50911, which acts as a selective gabab antagonist, quickly reverses ghb overdose in mice. however, this treatment has yet to be tried in humans, and it is unlikely that it will be researched for this purpose in humans due to the illegal nature of clinical trials of ghb and the lack of medical indemnity coverage inherent in using an untested treatment for a life-threatening overdose.


=== detection of use ===
ghb may be quantitated in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients, to provide evidence in an impaired driving, or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. blood or plasma ghb concentrations are usually in a range of 50–250 mg/l in persons receiving the drug therapeutically (during general anesthesia), 30–100 mg/l in those arrested for impaired driving, 50–500 mg/l in acutely intoxicated patients and 100–1000 mg/l in victims of fatal overdosage. urine is often the preferred specimen for routine drug abuse monitoring purposes. both γ-butyrolactone (gbl) and 1,4-butanediol are converted to ghb in the body.in january 2016, it was announced scientists had developed a way to detect ghb, among other things, in saliva.


== endogenous production ==
cells produce ghb by reduction of succinic semialdehyde via succinic semialdehyde reductase (ssr). this enzyme appears to be induced by camp levels, meaning substances that elevate camp, such as forskolin and vinpocetine, may increase ghb synthesis and release. conversely, endogeneous ghb production in those taking valproic acid will be inhibited via inhibition of the conversion from succinic acid semialdehyde to ghb. people with the disorder known as succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, also known as γ-hydroxybutyric aciduria, have elevated levels of ghb in their urine, blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid.the precise function of ghb in the body is not clear. it is known, however, that the brain expresses a large number of receptors that are activated by ghb. these receptors are excitatory, however, and therefore not responsible for the sedative effects of ghb; they have been shown to elevate the principal excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate. the benzamide antipsychotics—amisulpride, nemonapride, etc.—have been shown to bind to these ghb-activated receptors in vivo. other antipsychotics were tested and were not found to have an affinity for this receptor.
ghb is a precursor to gaba, glutamate, and glycine in certain brain areas.in spite of its demonstrated neurotoxicity, (see relevant section, above), ghb has neuroprotective properties, and has been found to protect cells from hypoxia.


== natural fermentation by-product ==
ghb is also produced as a result of fermentation and so is found in small quantities in some beers and wines, in particular fruit wines. the amount found in wine is pharmacologically insignificant and not sufficient to produce psychoactive effects.


== pharmacology ==
ghb has at least two distinct binding sites in the central nervous system. ghb acts as an agonist at the excitatory ghb receptor and as a weak agonist at the inhibitory gabab receptor. ghb is a naturally occurring substance that acts in a similar fashion to some neurotransmitters in the mammalian brain. ghb is probably synthesized from gaba in gabaergic neurons, and released when the neurons fire.ghb has been found to activate oxytocinergic neurons in the supraoptic nucleus.if taken orally, gaba itself does not effectively cross the blood–brain barrier.ghb induces the accumulation of either a derivative of tryptophan or tryptophan itself in the extracellular space, possibly by increasing tryptophan transport across the blood–brain barrier. the blood content of certain neutral amino-acids, including tryptophan, is also increased by peripheral ghb administration. ghb-induced stimulation of tissue serotonin turnover may be due to an increase in tryptophan transport to the brain and in its uptake by serotonergic cells. as the serotonergic system may be involved in the regulation of sleep, mood, and anxiety, the stimulation of this system by high doses of ghb may be involved in certain neuropharmacological events induced by ghb administration.
however, at therapeutic doses, ghb reaches much higher concentrations in the brain and activates gabab receptors, which are primarily responsible for its sedative effects. ghb's sedative effects are blocked by gabab antagonists.
the role of the ghb receptor in the behavioural effects induced by ghb is more complex. ghb receptors are densely expressed in many areas of the brain, including the cortex and hippocampus, and these are the receptors that ghb displays the highest affinity for. there has been somewhat limited research into the ghb receptor; however, there is evidence that activation of the ghb receptor in some brain areas results in the release of glutamate, the principal excitatory neurotransmitter. drugs that selectively activate the ghb receptor cause absence seizures in high doses, as do ghb and gabab agonists.activation of both the ghb receptor and gabab is responsible for the addictive profile of ghb. ghb's effect on dopamine release is biphasic. low concentrations stimulate dopamine release via the ghb receptor. higher concentrations inhibit dopamine release via gabab receptors as do other gabab agonists such as baclofen and phenibut. after an initial phase of inhibition, dopamine release is then increased via the ghb receptor. both the inhibition and increase of dopamine release by ghb are inhibited by opioid antagonists such as naloxone and naltrexone. dynorphin may play a role in the inhibition of dopamine release via kappa opioid receptors.this explains the paradoxical mix of sedative and stimulatory properties of ghb, as well as the so-called ""rebound"" effect, experienced by individuals using ghb as a sleeping agent, wherein they awake suddenly after several hours of ghb-induced deep sleep. that is to say that, over time, the concentration of ghb in the system decreases below the threshold for significant gabab receptor activation and activates predominantly the ghb receptor, leading to wakefulness.
recently, analogs of ghb, such as 4-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoic acid (umb68) have been synthesised and tested on animals, in order to gain a better understanding of ghb's mode of action. analogues of ghb such as 3-methyl-ghb, 4-methyl-ghb, and 4-phenyl-ghb have been shown to produce similar effects to ghb in some animal studies, but these compounds are even less well researched than ghb itself. of these analogues, only 4-methyl-ghb (γ-hydroxyvaleric acid, ghv) and a prodrug form γ-valerolactone (gvl) have been reported as drugs of abuse in humans, and on the available evidence seem to be less potent but more toxic than ghb, with a particular tendency to cause nausea and vomiting.
other prodrug ester forms of ghb have also rarely been encountered by law enforcement, including 1,4-butanediol diacetate (bdda/dabd), methyl-4-acetoxybutanoate (mab), and ethyl-4-acetoxybutanoate (eab), but these are, in general, covered by analogue laws in jurisdictions where ghb is illegal, and little is known about them beyond their delayed onset and longer duration of action. the intermediate compound γ-hydroxybutyraldehyde (ghbal) is also a prodrug for ghb; however, as with all aliphatic aldehydes this compound is caustic and is strong-smelling and foul-tasting; actual use of this compound as an intoxicant is likely to be unpleasant and result in severe nausea and vomiting.

both of the metabolic breakdown pathways shown for ghb can run in either direction, depending on the concentrations of the substances involved, so the body can make its own ghb either from gaba or from succinic semialdehyde. under normal physiological conditions, the concentration of ghb in the body is rather low, and the pathways would run in the reverse direction to what is shown here to produce endogenous ghb. however, when ghb is consumed for recreational or health promotion purposes, its concentration in the body is much higher than normal, which changes the enzyme kinetics so that these pathways operate to metabolise ghb rather than producing it.


== history ==
alexander zaytsev worked on this chemical family and published work on it in 1874. the first extended research into ghb and its use in humans was conducted in the early 1960s by dr. henri laborit to use in studying the neurotransmitter gaba.  it was studied in a range of uses including obstetric surgery and during childbirth and as an anxiolytic; there were anecdotal reports of it having antidepressant and aphrodisiac effects as well.  it was also studied as an intravenous anesthetic agent and was marketed for that purpose starting in 1964 in europe but it was not widely adopted as it caused seizures; as of 2006 that use was still authorized in france and italy but not widely used.  it was also studied to treat alcohol addiction; while the evidence for this use is weak, however sodium oxybate is marketed for this use in italy.ghb and sodium oxybate were also studied for use in narcolepsy from the 1960s onwards.in may 1990 ghb was introduced as a dietary supplement and was marketed to body builders, for help with weight control and as a sleep aid, and as a ""replacement"" for l-tryptophan, which was removed from the market in november 1989 when batches contaminated with trace impurities  were found to cause eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, although eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome is also tied to tryptophan overload. in 2001 tryptophan supplement sales were allowed to resume, and in 2005 the fda ban on tryptophan supplement importation was lifted. by november 1989 57 cases of illness caused by the ghb supplements had been reported to the centers for disease control and prevention, with people having taken up to three teaspoons of ghb; there were no deaths but nine people needed care in an intensive care unit.  the fda issued a warning in november 1990 that sale of ghb was illegal.  ghb continued to be manufactured and sold illegally and it and analogs were adopted as a club drug and came to be used as a date rape drug, and the dea made seizures and the fda reissued warnings several times throughout the 1990s.at the same time, research on the use of ghb in the form of sodium oxybate had formalized, as a company called orphan medical had filed an investigational new drug application and was running clinical trials with the intention of gaining regulatory approval for use to treat narcolepsy.a popular children's toy, bindeez (also known as aqua dots, in the united states), produced by melbourne company moose, was banned in australia in early november 2007 when it was discovered that 1,4-butanediol (1,4-b), which is metabolized into ghb, had been substituted for the non-toxic plasticiser 1,5-pentanediol in the bead manufacturing process. three young children were hospitalized as a result of ingesting a large number of the beads, and the toy was recalled.


== legal status ==

in the united states, ghb was placed on schedule i of the controlled substances act in march 2000. however, used in sodium oxybate under an ind or nda from the us fda, it is considered a schedule iii substance but with schedule i trafficking penalties, one of several drugs that are listed in multiple schedules.on 20 march 2001, the un commission on narcotic drugs placed ghb in schedule iv of the 1971 convention on psychotropic substances.in the uk ghb was made a class c drug in june 2003. in october 2013 the acmd recommended upgrading it from schedule iv to schedule ii in line with un recommendations. their report concluded that the minimal use of xyrem in the uk meant that prescribers would be minimally inconvenienced by the rescheduling. this advice was followed and ghb was moved to schedule 2 on 7 january 2015.in hong kong, ghb is regulated under schedule 1 of hong kong's chapter 134 dangerous drugs ordinance. it can only be used legally by health professionals and for university research purposes. the substance can be given by pharmacists under a prescription. anyone who supplies the substance without prescription can be fined hk$10,000. the penalty for trafficking or manufacturing the substance is a hk$150,000 fine and life imprisonment. possession of the substance for consumption without license from the department of health is illegal with a hk$100,000 fine or five years of jail time.
in canada, ghb has been a schedule i controlled substance since 6 november 2012 (the same schedule that contains heroin and cocaine).  prior to that date, it was a schedule iii controlled substance (the same schedule that contains amphetamines and lsd).in new zealand and australia, ghb, 1,4-b, and gbl are all class b illegal drugs, along with any possible esters, ethers, and aldehydes. gaba itself is also listed as an illegal drug in these jurisdictions, which seems unusual given its failure to cross the blood–brain barrier, but there was a perception among legislators that all known analogues should be covered as far as this was possible. attempts to circumvent the illegal status of ghb have led to the sale of derivatives such as 4-methyl-ghb (γ-hydroxyvaleric acid, ghv) and its prodrug form γ-valerolactone (gvl), but these are also covered under the law by virtue of their being ""substantially similar"" to ghb or gbl and; so importation, sale, possession and use of these compounds is also considered to be illegal.
in chile, ghb is a controlled drug under the law ley de substancias psicotrópicas y estupefacientes (psychotropic substances and narcotics).
in norway and in switzerland, ghb is considered a narcotic and is only available by prescription under the trade name xyrem (union chimique belge s.a.).
sodium oxybate is also used therapeutically in italy under the brand name alcover for treatment of alcohol withdrawal and dependence.

larry wallis,non_science,"larry wallis (19 may 1949 – 19 september 2019) was an english guitarist, songwriter and producer. he was best known as a member of the pink fairies and an early member of motörhead.


== biography and career ==


=== early bands ===
in 1968, he formed a band called the entire sioux nation with terry nolder on vocals, tim taylor on bass and paul nichols on drums (born in 1949). the band split up in late 1969.


=== shagrat ===

steve peregrin took and mick farren formed shagrat with wallis and his ex-entire sioux nation bandmate taylor in february 1970.  (previously, took and farren had been with twink and girlfriend sally ""silver darling"" melzer in a prototype pink fairies lineup.  twink and melzer left the band and in late january 1970, twink formed pink fairies mark 2 with farren's former bandmates from the deviants who had just returned to britain after having previously sacked farren in canada in late 1969, leaving farren bandless and then found themselves stranded in north america for several months.)  very soon though, farren left after having a falling-out with took. 
shagrat thus became took's band outright.  took, wallis and taylor were joined by drummer phil lenoir, formerly of black cat bones.  this lineup recorded three tracks at strawberry studios in stockport played one gig at the phun city festival in july 1970 before taylor and lenoir left.  took and wallis carried on with drummer dave bidwell and in early 1971 the trio recorded four acoustic took songs.  all seven tracks were released in the early 1990s on limited edition vinyl and were later compiled together on the cd lone star in 2001 by japanese label captain trip records, later re-released in 2016 on cleopatra records with bonus tracks from the 1972 sessions described below.


=== blodwyn pig, took and ufo ===
wallis then joined blodwyn pig, which changed its name to lancaster's bombers (later shortened to lancaster) with jack lancaster. they were a short-lived band although they toured supporting yes in 1971.
in february 1972, wallis joined ufo, but left in october 1972, after a tour by europe. wallis did not record with the band, although a bootlegged live recording of a ufo performance featuring wallis is known to exist, as does a black and white kinescope print of a live set on french tv show rock en stock.sometime during 1972 wallis recorded sessions with steve peregrin took at took’s basement flat in mayfair. these very casual sessions contain appearances by twink, mick wayne, duncan sanderson, and almost certainly syd barrett.  material from these sessions was released in 1995 as the missing link to tyrannosaurus rex, a posthumous took solo album on cleopatra records


=== the pink fairies ===
in november 1972, wallis joined the pink fairies, substituting for mick wayne. the band released an  album kings of oblivion which contained mostly wallis-penned tracks. the band played with an extended line-up for a special gig in july 1975. several years later, in 1982, their only live performance was released as live at the roundhouse 1975. in 1991, it was reissued under the name at the roundhouse/previously unreleased, comprising the original live album, plus additional songs by larry wallis from 1984, and an ep by twink from 1977.


=== motörhead ===
while still a member of the pink fairies, in may 1975 wallis joined a new band called motörhead with lemmy and lucas fox. in september 1975 fox left the band and motörhead recruited a new drummer, phil ""philthy animal"" taylor. wallis recorded an album with the band, on parole. it remained unreleased until 1979 when motörhead had established some reputation for themselves. in february 1976 wallis was joined by ""fast"" eddie clarke on guitar. later in the same month wallis left motörhead.


=== steve took ===
during 1975 and 1976, wallis did further recording work with took although none of these sessions have been released to date. wallis was present, by chance, at pathway studios on 29 november 1977 when steve took's horns recorded material which would eventually be released in 2004.


=== stiff records - performer and producer ===
wallis remained with pink fairies, which continued as a trio, until july 1976 when they gained additional guitarist, martin stone. in september 1976 the band released a single, ""between the lines""/""spoiling for a fight"" on stiff records. four months later in january 1977 the band split up. in the same month wallis guested at a one-off gig with members of thin lizzy and rat scabies of the damned.
wallis then became an in-house producer at stiff records. he released a solo single, ""police car""/""on parole"" produced by nick lowe, and backed by two members of eddie and the hot rods; bassist paul gray, and drummer steve nicol. ""police car"" has been covered by the members and snips.  as well as appearing on a compilation album a bunch of stiff records, wallis was part of an ad hoc line-up called the takeaways which included dave edmunds, nick lowe and sean tyla. wallis took part in the live stiffs tour in 1977 and appears as 'larry wallis' psychedelic rowdies' on the album, live stiffs live, that was released later that year.
wallis also produced albums for a number of stiff records artists including wreckless eric, the adverts and mick farren's ep screwed up (november 1977) and album vampires stole my lunch money (august 1978). his song, ""as long as the price is right"", first appeared on dr. feelgood's 1977 album, be seeing you; and a live version of the track was later issued as a single in april 1979.in 1980, wallis recorded an album for stiff records but it was left unreleased when wallis refused to sign a seven album contract with the label and was consequently dropped.  individual tracks have surfaced on various compilations or were rerecorded by wallis for subsequent projects.


=== farren/mc5 collaborations and his own bands ===
in september 1978, wallis became a member of another farren project mick farren & the good guys; featuring mick farren (vocals), andy colquhoun (guitar), willy stallybrass (harmonica), gary tibbs (bass) and alan (hawkwind) powell (drums).
in march 1979 wallis joined ex-mc5 band member wayne kramer, andy colquhoun and george butler for a series of live gigs.
in february 1982 wallis formed larry wallis & the death commandos of love with johnny reverb on guitar, big george webley on bass and jim toomey on drums. this line up was short lived and wallis soon began playing a regular series of gigs, mostly at dingwalls, with a line up completed by duncan sanderson, andy colquhoun and george butler, this line up began life as 'the police cars', playing a christmas gig as the police sleighs before using a large number of aliases such as the pearl divers of death, the starry smoothounds, the knob artists, the death commandoes of love, the donut dunkers of death (as support to the deviants - actually the same band with mick farren on vocals) before settling on the more permanent love pirates of doom. this line up lasted up until the 1987 pink fairies reunion, though in 1986 sanderson was replaced by another bassist called tony.
in 1984 wallis was once again working with mick farren who resurrected the deviants name to record a live album human garbage featuring mick farren on vocals, wayne kramer and wallis on guitars, duncan sanderson on bass and vocals, and george butler on drums.


=== pink fairies resurrection ===
in 1987 the pink fairies were revived with wallis on guitar and vocals, andy colquhoun on guitar, duncan sanderson on bass and vocals, and both twink and russell hunter on drums. this resulted in the album kill 'em and eat 'em. by 1988 twink had left the band, who continued to gig sporadically, even playing european gigs in germany and france, until wallis too left. a final throw of the dice took place on 5 march 1989 at the bob calvert memorial show in brixton academy under the umbrellas name 'pink fairies psychedelic revue' though in reality this comprised separate sets from flying colours (sanderson, hunter, colquhoun) and larry wallis' bandanna club, featuring various friends such as pete thomas (drums) and canvey islands kennedy brothers,


=== dr. feelgood links ===
around 1991 wallis worked with lee brilleaux and phil mitchell (both from dr. feelgood) on the on the bench recording, with ian gibbons. this led to the formation of wallis' new band, the redbirds featuring wallis (guitar, vocals), mitchell (bass) and chris north (drums). the redbyrds released one 12 inch ep, truth, justice and a wholesome packed lunch. wallis also wrote many songs that dr. feelgood later performed, such as ""as long as the price is right"", ""punch drunk"", ""talk of the devil"", and ""can't find the lady"", among others.


=== back in business ===
2001 saw the first wallis solo album to reach release stage, death in the guitarfternoon.  a comeback gig for the fairies was planned for the roundhouse, chalk farm, london on 22 january 2007, however, this was cancelled due to wallis having a trapped nerve in his back. it was never rescheduled.


=== death ===
wallis died on 19 september 2019, aged 70.

solanapyrone d,reagent,"in organic chemistry, an intramolecular diels-alder cycloaddition is a diels–alder reaction in which the diene and a dienophile are both part of the same molecule. the reaction leads to the formation of the same cyclohexene-like structure as usual for a diels–alder reaction, but as part of a more complex fused or bridged cyclic ring system.


== reaction products ==
because the two reacting groups are already attached, two basic modes of addition are possible in this reaction. depending on whether the tether that links to the dienophile is attached to the end or the middle of the diene, fused or bridged polycyclic ring systems can be formed.the tether than attaches the two reacting groups also affects the geometry of the reaction. as a result of its conformational and other structural restrictions, the exo vs endo results are usually not based on the simple (intermolecular) diels–alder reaction effects.


== applications ==
intramolecular diels-alder cycloaddition is extremely useful for the formation of naturally occurring polycyclic rings.  the reaction provides ready access to polycyclic compounds with a great deal of stereoselectivity.  the following are several useful drugs whose complete synthesis has been accomplished using the intramolecular diels-alder reaction.


=== solanapyrone a ===
solanapyrone a is an inhibitor of mammalian dna polymerase β and λ, repair type dna polymerase.  the compound was isolated from the phytopathogenic fungi alternaria solani, the cause of early blight in tomato and potato plants.


=== salvinorin a ===
isolated from the hallucinogenic sage salvia divinorum, salvinorin a is a potent and selective κ-opioid agonist.  the compound has potential uses in psychotherapuetic treatments and alzheimer's treatment.

hydromorphone oral powder,drug,"hydromorphone, also known as dihydromorphinone, and sold under the brand name dilaudid among others, is an opioid used to treat moderate to severe pain. typically, long-term use is only recommended for pain due to cancer. it may be used by mouth or by injection into a vein, muscle, or under the skin. effects generally begin within half an hour and last for up to five hours.common side effects include dizziness, sleepiness, nausea, itchiness, and constipation. serious side effects may include abuse, low blood pressure, seizures, respiratory depression, and serotonin syndrome. rapidly decreasing the dose may result in opioid withdrawal. generally, use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is not recommended. hydromorphone is believed to work by activating opioid receptors, mainly in the brain and spinal cord. hydromorphone 2 mg by mouth is equivalent to approximately 10 mg morphine by mouth.hydromorphone was patented in 1923. it is available as a generic medication. in 2017, it was the 205th most commonly prescribed medication in the united states, with more than two million prescriptions. hydromorphone is made from morphine.


== medical use ==
hydromorphone is used to treat moderate to severe pain. it may be used by mouth or by injection into a vein, muscle, or under the skin. effects generally begin within half an hour and last for up to five hours. typically, long-term use is only recommended for pain due to cancer. a 2016 cochrane review found little difference in benefit between hydromorphone and other opioids for cancer pain.


== side effects ==
adverse effects of hydromorphone are similar to those of other potent opioid analgesics, such as morphine and heroin. the major hazards of hydromorphone include dose-related respiratory depression, urinary retention, bronchospasm, and sometimes, circulatory depression. more common side effects include lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, itching, constipation, nausea, vomiting, headache, perspiration, and hallucinations. these symptoms are common in ambulatory patients and in those not experiencing severe pain.
simultaneous use of hydromorphone with other opioids, muscle relaxants, tranquilizers, sedatives, and general anesthetics may cause a significant increase in respiratory depression, progressing to coma or death. taking benzodiazepines (such as diazepam) in conjunction with hydromorphone may increase side effects such as dizziness and difficulty concentrating. if simultaneous use of these drugs is required, dose adjustment may be made.a particular problem that may occur with hydromorphone is accidental administration in place of morphine due to a mix-up between the similar names, either at the time the prescription is written or when the drug is dispensed. this has led to several deaths and calls for hydromorphone to be distributed in distinctly different packaging from morphine to avoid confusion.massive overdoses are rarely observed in opioid-tolerant individuals, but when they occur, they may lead to circulatory system collapse. symptoms of overdose include respiratory depression, drowsiness leading to coma and sometimes to death, drooping of skeletal muscles, low heart rate, and decreasing blood pressure. at the hospital, individuals with hydromorphone overdose are provided supportive care, such as assisted ventilation to provide oxygen and gut decontamination using activated charcoal through a nasogastric tube. opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, also may be administered concurrently with oxygen supplementation. naloxone works by reversing the effects of hydromorphone, and only is administered in the presence of significant respiratory depression and circulatory depression.sugar cravings associated with hydromorphone use are the result of a glucose crash after transient hyperglycemia following injection, or a less profound lowering of blood sugar over a period of hours, in common with morphine, heroin, codeine, and other opiates.


=== hormone imbalance ===

as with other opioids, hydromorphone (particularly during heavy chronic use) often causes temporary hypogonadism or hormone imbalance.


=== neurotoxicity ===
in the setting of prolonged use, high dosage, and/or kidney dysfunction, hydromorphone has been associated with neuroexcitatory symptoms such as tremor, myoclonus, agitation, and cognitive dysfunction. this toxicity is less than that associated with other classes of opioids such as the pethidine class of synthetics in particular.


=== withdrawal ===
users of hydromorphone may experience painful symptoms if the drug is suspended. some people cannot tolerate the symptoms, which results in continuous drug use. symptoms of opioid withdrawal are not easy to decipher, as there are differences between drug-seeking behaviors and true withdrawal effects. symptoms associated with hydromorphone withdrawal include:
abdominal pain
anxiety or panic attacks
depression
goose bump skin
inability to enjoy daily activities
muscle and joint pain
nausea
runny nose and excessive secretion of tears
sweating
vomitingin the clinical setting, excessive secretion of tears, yawning, and dilation of pupils are helpful presentations in diagnosing opioid withdrawal. hydromorphone is a rapid acting pain killer; however, some formulations may last up to several hours. patients who stop taking this drug abruptly may experience withdrawal symptoms, which may start within hours of taking the last dose of hydromorphone, and last up to several weeks. withdrawal symptoms in people who stopped taking the opioid may be managed by using opioids or non-opioid adjuncts. methadone is an opioid commonly used for this kind of therapy. however, the selection of therapy should be tailored to each specific person. methadone also is used for detoxification in people who have opioid addiction, such as heroin or drugs similar to morphine. it may be given orally or intramuscularly. there is controversy regarding the use of opioids for people experiencing withdrawal symptoms, since these agents also may cause relapse on patients when they suspend therapy. clonidine is a non-opioid adjunct, which may be used in situations where opioid use is not desired, such as in patients with high blood pressure.


== interactions ==
cns depressants may enhance the depressant effects of hydromorphone, such as other opioids, anesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, chloral hydrate, dimenhydrinate, and glutethimide. the depressant effect of hydromorphone also may be enhanced by monoamine oxidase inhibitors (mao inhibitors), first-generation antihistamines (brompheniramine, promethazine, diphenhydramine, chlorphenamine), beta blockers, and alcohol. when combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced.

hydromorphone is a semi-synthetic μ-opioid agonist. as a hydrogenated ketone of morphine, it shares the pharmacologic properties typical of opioid analgesics. hydromorphone and related opioids produce their major effects on the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. these include analgesia, drowsiness, mental clouding, changes in mood, euphoria or dysphoria, respiratory depression, cough suppression, decreased gastrointestinal motility, nausea, vomiting, increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure, increased biliary pressure, and increased pinpoint constriction of the pupils.


=== formulations ===

hydromorphone is available in parenteral, rectal, subcutaneous, and oral formulations, and also can be administered via epidural or intrathecal injection. hydromorphone also has been administered via nebulization to treat shortness of breath, but it is not used as a route for pain control due to low bioavailability. transdermal delivery systems are also under consideration to induce local skin analgesia.concentrated aqueous solutions of hydromorphone hydrochloride have a visibly different refractive index from pure water, isotonic 9‰ (0·9 per cent) saline and the like, especially when stored in clear ampoules and phials may acquire a slight clear amber discolouration upon exposure to light; this reportedly has no effect on the potency of the solution, but 14-dihydromorphinones such as hydromorphone, oxymorphone, and relatives come with instructions to protect from light. ampoules of solution which have developed a precipitate should be discarded.battery-powered intrathecal drug delivery systems are implanted for chronic pain when other options are ruled out, such as surgery and traditional pharmacotherapy, provided that the patient is considered a suitable fit in terms of any contraindications, both physiological and psychological.an extended-release (once-daily) version of hydromorphone is available in the united states. previously, an extended-release version of hydromorphone, palladone, was available before being voluntarily withdrawn from the market after a july 2005 fda advisory warned of a high overdose potential when taken with alcohol. as of march 2010, it is still available in the united kingdom under the brand name palladone sr, nepal under the brand name opidol, and in most other european countries.


=== pharmacokinetics ===
the chemical modification of the morphine molecule to hydromorphone results in higher lipid solubility and greater ability to cross the blood–brain barrier to produce more rapid and complete central nervous system penetration. on a per milligram basis, hydromorphone is considered to be five times as potent as morphine; although the conversion ratio may vary from 4–8 times, five times is in typical clinical usage. the development of tolerance also may vary among individuals.
patients with renal abnormalities must exercise caution when dosing hydromorphone. in those with renal impairment, the half-life of hydromorphone may increase to as much as 40 hours. the typical half-life of intravenous hydromorphone is 2.3 hours. peak plasma levels usually occur between 30 and 60 minutes after oral dosing.the onset of action for hydromorphone administered intravenously is less than 5 minutes and within 30 minutes of oral administration (immediate release).


=== metabolism ===
while other opioids in its class, such as codeine or oxycodone, are metabolized via cyp450 enzymes, hydromorphone is not. hydromorphone is extensively metabolized in the liver to hydromorphone-3-glucoronide, which has no analgesic effects. as similarly seen with the morphine metabolite, morphine-3-glucoronide, a build-up in levels of hydromorphone-3-glucoronide may produce excitatory neurotoxic effects such as restlessness, myoclonus and hyperalgesia. patients with compromised kidney function and older patients are at higher risk for metabolite accumulation.


== chemistry ==
with a formula of c17h19no3 and a molecular weight of 285.343, both identical to morphine, hydromorphone can be considered a structural isomer of morphine and is a hydrogenated ketone thereof.hydromorphone is made from morphine either by direct re-arrangement (made by reflux heating of alcoholic or acidic aqueous solution of morphine in the presence of platinum or palladium catalyst) or reduction to dihydromorphine (usually via catalytic hydrogenation), followed by oxidation with benzophenone in presence of potassium tert butoxide or aluminium tert butoxide (oppenauer oxidation). the 6 ketone group may be replaced with a methylene group via the wittig reaction to produce 6-methylenedihydrodesoxymorphine, which is 80× stronger than morphine.changing morphine into hydromorphone increases its activity and, therefore, makes hydromorphone approximately eight times stronger than morphine on a weight basis, all other things being equal. changed also is lipid solubility, contributing to hydromorphone's having a more rapid onset of action and alterations to the overall absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination profile as well as the side effect profile (in general, less nausea and itching) versus that of morphine. the semi-synthetic opiates, of which hydromorphone and its codeine analogue hydrocodone are among the best-known and oldest, include a huge number of drugs of varying strengths and with differences among themselves both subtle and stark, allowing for many different options for treatment.
hydromorphone is more soluble in water than morphine; therefore, hydromorphone solutions may be produced to deliver the drug in a smaller volume of water. the hydrochloride salt is soluble in three parts of water, whereas a gram of morphine hydrochloride dissolves in 16 ml of water; for all common purposes, the pure powder for hospital use can be used to produce solutions of virtually arbitrary concentration. when the powder appeared on the street, this very small volume of powder needed for a dose means that overdoses are likely for those who mistake it for heroin or other powdered narcotics, especially those that have been diluted prior to consumption.


=== endogenous production ===
hydromorphone is made from morphine via catalytic hydrogenation and also is produced in trace amounts by human and other mammalian metabolisms of morphine. it occasionally appears in assays of opium latex in very small quantities, apparently forming in the plant in an unknown percentage of cases under poorly understood conditions.


==== bacteria ====
some bacteria have been shown to be able to turn morphine into closely related drugs, including hydromorphone and dihydromorphine among others. the bacterium pseudomonas putida serotype m10 produces a naturally-occurring nadh-dependent morphinone reductase that can work on unsaturated 7,8 bonds, with result that, when these bacteria are living in an aqueous solution containing morphine, significant amounts of hydromorphone form, as it is an intermediary metabolite in this process; the same goes for codeine being turned into hydrocodone.the process gave rise to various concentrations of hydromorphone, dihydromorphine, hydromorphinol, and oxymorphone during the experiments. three paths were found: from morphine to hydromorphone with dihydromorphine as the penultimate step, from morphine to hydromorphone with morphinone as the penultimate step, and from morphine to hydromorphinol to hydromorphone.


== history ==
hydromorphone was patented in 1923. it was introduced to the mass market in 1926 under the brand name dilaudid, indicating its derivation and degree of similarity to morphine (by way of laudanum).


== society and culture ==


=== names ===
hydromorphone is known in various countries around the world by the brand names hydal, dimorphone, exalgo, sophidone lp, dilaudid, hydrostat, hydromorfan, hydromorphan, hymorphan, laudicon, opidol, palladone, hydromorph contin, and others. an extended-release version of hydromorphone, called palladone, was available for a short time in the united states before being voluntarily withdrawn from the market after a july 2005 fda advisory warned of a high overdose potential when taken with alcohol. as of march 2010, it is still available in nepal under the brand name opidol, in the united kingdom under the brand name palladone sr, and in most other european countries.
there has also been a once-daily prolonged release version of hydromorphone available in australia under the brand name jurnista as of may 2009.


=== legal status ===
in the united states, the main drug control agency, the drug enforcement administration, reports an increase in annual aggregate production quotas of hydromorphone from 766 kilograms (1,689 pounds) in 1998 to 3,300 kilograms (7,300 lb) in 2006, and an increase in prescriptions in this time of 289%, from about 470,000 to 1,830,000. the 2013 production quota was 5,968 kilograms (13,157 lb).like all opioids used for analgesia, hydromorphone is potentially habit-forming and is listed in schedule ii of the united states controlled substances act of 1970 as well as in similar levels under the drugs laws of practically all other countries and it is listed in the single convention on narcotic drugs. the dea acscn for hydromorphone is 9150.
hydromorphone is listed under the german betäubungsmittelgesetz as a betäubungsmittel in the most restricted schedule for medicinal drugs; it is controlled similarly in austria (suchtgift) under the smg and the swiss betmg. the misuse of drugs act 1971 (united kingdom) and comparable french, canadian, australian, italian, czech, croatian, slovenian, swedish, polish, spanish, greek, russian, and other laws similarly control it, as do regulations in virtually all other countries.


=== use in executions ===
in 2009, ohio approved the use of an intramuscular injection of 500 mg of hydromorphone and a supratherapeutic dose of midazolam as a backup means of carrying out executions when a suitable vein cannot be found for intravenous injection.hydromorphone and midazolam was injected intravenously to execute double-murderer joseph wood in arizona on 24 july 2014. wood was heavily sedated (surgical anesthesia) within four minutes from start, but took almost two hours to transition to stage 4 (cessation of respiration) and death.

ice cream man (film),non_science,"ice cream man is a 1995 american comedy slasher film, produced and directed by norman apstein, written by sven davison and david dobkin, and starring clint howard, olivia hussey, and david naughton. the plot follows a deranged man recently released from a psychiatric institution who opens an ice cream factory where he begins using human flesh in his recipes.
the film had an estimated $2 million budget and was released direct-to-video, and in recent years has developed a cult following among viewers who see it as an unintentional comedy, and enjoy it for its campy production values. joe bob briggs hosted the film on tnt, when it was shown on monstervision. howard himself made an appearance, discussing the film with briggs. it was released on dvd in 2004.


== plot ==
in a 1950s american suburb, young gregory tudor witnesses his local ice cream man, known as the ""ice cream king,"" getting murdered in a drive-by shooting. in the present, gregory has taken over the ""king's"" business, calling himself the ice cream prince, and using the man's truck and ice cream parlor. unbeknownst to the public, gregory is putting gruesome ingredients in his ice cream such as insects, blood, and body parts, and is using the dilapidated ice cream parlor as a sort of laboratory in which he produces his concoctions.
one night, gregory kills a dog belonging to nurse wharton—his landlord and one of the orderlies who treated him for his childhood trauma. the same night, roger, a boy from the neighborhood, goes missing. the other children, having witnessed gregory's creepy personality, suspect him of kidnapping roger, but the police and nurse wharton do not. the kids, johnny, heather, and tuna, agree to gang up and search for roger themselves. soon after, another boy known as small paul disappears.
the kids are initially unable to prove that gregory is dangerous, and the police persist in not believing them. gregory has recurring flashbacks to his abusive treatment at the wishing well sanatorium, and obsessively idolizes the ice cream king, visiting the man's grave at odd hours of the night. as the kids dig deeper, it is revealed that gregory really did kidnap roger and small paul, and is keeping them in a cage at the ice cream parlor. however, small paul shows a macabre interest in gregory's experiments, and so gregory takes him under his wing.
two detectives investigate the wishing well, which turns out to be an unregulated free-for-all; the unstable patients roam freely and cause chaos, while the doctors and administrators are insane themselves. the police now believe the children regarding gregory's craziness, and prepare to search for roger and small paul at the ice cream parlor. when gregory kidnaps tuna, heather enlists the help of tuna's older brother jacob to investigate the parlor, but jacob is killed by gregory, who also kills jacob's girlfriend and frightens heather and johnny into running around the property. gregory outsmarts the two cops and knocks them unconscious. by holding a photo of the ice cream king over his face, small paul causes gregory to walk into a trap that pulls him into the main ice cream mixer, where gregory is dismembered by the razor-sharp mixing blade.
roger and tuna are reunited with their friends, who mention that small paul has been sent to therapy. a closing shot shows small paul sitting alone in a darkened room, silently churning a bucket of ice cream, his face twisted into an evil leer just like gregory's.

palestinians in syria,non_science,"palestinians in syria (arabic: الفلسطينيون في سوريا‎) are people of palestinian origin, most of whom have been residing in syria after they were displaced from their homeland during the 1948 palestinian exodus. palestinians hold most of the same rights as the syrian population, but cannot become syrian nationals except in rare cases.


== history ==
most palestinian refugees fled to syria in 1948 and came from northern palestine districts, safad, haifa, java, acre, tiberias, and nazareth. some refugees arrived in syria via lebanon, some came from galilee and the hula valley onto the golan heights, and others came directly from palestine to jordan to syria. by the summer of 1948, there were about 70,000 palestinian refugees in syria, the majority concentrated along the border area with israel. the refugees were initially housed in deserted military barracks in as-suwayda, aleppo, homs, and hama. in 1949, law no. 450 established the palestine arab refugee institution (pari), which later was replaced by the general authority for palestine arab refugees (gapar), to manage the palestinian refugee affairs. gapar's responsibilities were refugee registration, relief assistance, finding employment opportunities for the refugees, and managing funds and contributions intended for them. gapar, with unrwa, jointly administer the camps. around 526,000 palestine refugees are registered with unrwa. there are nine official and three unofficial camps for refugees.in 1967, palestinian refugees fled the quneitra governorate in the golan heights, and around 4,200 of them were housed in daraa emergency camp. in 1970, as a result of black september, some palestinian refugees fled from jordan to syria. in 1982, in the wake of 1982 lebanon war, a few thousand palestinian refugees left lebanon and found shelter in syria.the initial influx of palestinians was substantial (90,000–100,000), and the government, through a series of laws, gradually paved the way for their integration into the syrian socioeconomic structure while preserving their separate palestinian identity.


=== current trends ===
due to the civil war in syria that commenced in 2011, many palestinians in syria have been displaced, either within syria, itself or they have fled the country. their propensity to fleeing includes having been under siege in refugee camps, while many have opted to make the dangerous journey to europe as conditions remain hostile to palestinians in neighboring middle eastern states. according to unrwa, more than half a million palestinians resided in refugee camps in syria before the war started. as of 2019, it is estimated that at least 120,000 palestinians have been displaced from syria since 2011.according to the euro-mediterranean human rights monitor, palestinians who lived in refugee camps in syria have faced additional obstacles, since they have been made ""refugees for the second time"". the geneva-based organization reported that more than 160,000 palestinian syrian refugees had left their camps in syria, migrating to neighboring or countries of the european union. these include nearly 80,000 refugees who fled to europe, 57,276 others who fled to neighboring countries, such as lebanon, jordan, and turkey, and another 7,000 palestinian syrian refugees who fled to egypt and the gaza strip.
3,642 palestinians died during the first seven years of war, 1,651 palestinians had been detained and more than 300 palestinians were unaccounted for. residents of palestinian camps are suffering from air raids, shelling, siege, and malnutrition, in particular in yarmouk camp in the damascus area, besieged by the government until 2018, leading to the displacement of over 100,000 and many deaths from starvation. by 2019, 3,987 palestinians, including 467 women and 200 children, had been killed in the conflict.according to the spokesperson of the united nations relief and works agency or unrwa, chris gunness, ""palestinians are among those worst affected by the syrian conflict."" he explained that 95 percent of the 438,000 palestinians are in ""critical need of sustained humanitarian assistance. the unrwa is an agency that works for palestine refugee and is mostly funded by voluntary contributions. they also receive their funding from the regular budget of the united nations. unrwa was established by the united nations general assembly resolution 302 iv of 8 december 1949 to carry out relief programs for palestinian refugees. gunness also states ""the war in syria has devastated lives with incalculable cruelty. in this situation, many of the services unrwa provides are often literally life-saving."" gunness is referring to the clinics, emergency assistance and teaching staff that unrwa provides. any pullback in funding has an effect on care for this population. the unrwa educates 45,000 students a day, without funding this agency would no longer be able to assist students. 54 percent of unrwa funds go to education, 17 percent goes to health, 16 percent goes to support services, 9 percent goes to relief and social services and 4 percent goes to infrastructure and camp improvement. the trump administration announced that the united states will indefinitely withhold 65 million dollars of its planned 125 million contributions to the unrwa.the president of the united states, donald j. trump pulled back funding for the united nations agency for palestinian refugees. on 2 january 2018, he wrote ""it’s not just pakistan that we pay billions of dollars for nothing, but also many other countries, and others. as an example, we pay the palestinians hundred of millions of dollars a year and get no appreciation or respect. they don’t even want to negotiate a long overdue…""


== rights ==
children born in syria to fathers who are palestinian nationals, even if they themselves were born in syria, are considered palestinian not syrian nationals. ""only in very limited circumstances, such as the absence or statelessness of a father, could the mother grant her child syrian citizenship.""palestinians in syria have the right to own more than one business or commercial enterprise as well as the right to lease properties. these rights extend to trade and commerce. union membership in syria is also open to palestinians. palestinians are free to travel throughout syria and have the right to establish residence in syrian villages and cities.there is, however, a prominent gap in the home and land ownership laws. unlike syrian nationals, palestinians may not own more than one home or purchase arable land. the 1965 casablanca protocol regarded the treatment of palestinians living in the arab states, it consisted of the following regulations (1) whilst retaining their palestinian nationality, palestinians currently residing in the land of ...... have the right of employment on par with its citizens. (2) palestinians residing at the moment in ...... in accordance with the dictates of their interests have the right to leave and return to this state. (3) palestinians residing in other arab states have the right to enter the land of ...... and to depart from it, in accordance with their interests. their right of entry only gives them the right to stay for the permitted period and for the purpose they entered for, so long as the authorities do not agree to the contrary. (4) palestinians who are at the moment in ......, as well as those who were residing and left to the diaspora, are given, upon request, valid travel documents. the concerned authorities must, wherever they be, issue these documents or renew them without delay. (5) bearers of these travel documents residing in las states receive the same treatment as all other las state citizens, regarding visa, and residency applications. salim salamah is the director of the palestinian league of human rights – syria argues that ""palestinian refugees in syria and those who have been doubly displaced to neighboring countries will suffer as a result of the decision. the impact is going to be really massive and tragic, for palestinians of syria, its life-saving aid, especially in the context that many palestinians lack access to many basic services, even [ those who fled] in lebanon or jordan. it falls within the long-standing tradition of eroding the existence of palestinians... and it is tragic"".


== demographics ==
according to gapar data, 85,000 palestinian refugees settled in syria by the end of 1948. in 1960 the number became 126,662 and in 1989, the refugee population rose to 296,508. by the end of 1998, the number of refugees was 366,493. in 2011 the unrwa reported having 526,744 registered refugees. due to harsh conditions the number of registered refugees has dropped to about 450,000 due to many palestinians fleeing to lebanon, jordan or elsewhere in the region. in 2011 many syrian palestinians escaped the war and went to europe as refugees, especially in germany and sweden.

lincoln mill and mill village historic district,non_science,"the lincoln mill and mill village historic district is a historic district in huntsville, alabama.  opened in 1900, it quickly grew to be huntsville's largest cotton mill in the first quarter of the 20th century.  after closing in 1955, the mills were converted to office space that was used by the u.s. space program.  two of the older production buildings burned in 1980, but one main building and numerous houses built for workers remain.  the district was listed on the national register of historic places in 2010.


== history ==
the lincoln mill began in 1900 as an entirely locally funded concern.  one of the investors was trevanian dallas, founder of the adjacent dallas mill.  named the madison spinning company, the original building was built on oakwood avenue.  the mill required more capital to continue operating by 1903, and outside investors were brought in, including william lincoln barrell.  despite the extra cash, the mill closed in 1906.  it reopened in 1908 under the name abingdon mills.  abingdon constructed a new mill building in 1915, and an addition to it in 1916.  the mill was expanded again in 1918, with a two-story addition to the twisting mill, bringing capacity to 28,080 spindles and 476 looms.  47 houses and the village's first school were also built.
despite the extra capacity, abingdon went bankrupt in 1918.  barrell bought the company at auction, and production resumed later that year under the name lincoln mill.  the next decade saw vast expansion of the mill and village.  the company began constructing 40 more duplexes and apartment buildings north of oakwood avenue, on a tight grid pattern of streets which became known as lincoln village.  a new mill building, costing $2 million and containing 750,000 square feet (70,000 sq. m.), was built in 1923–24.  a one-story dye house quickly followed, and the mill employed 1,000 workers and operated 102,000 spindles.  600 additional houses and apartments were built to serve the expanded workforce.  another expansion in 1927 included more units for mill no. 3 and 500 houses and apartments south of the mill.  the expansion brought the operation to its highest capacity of 120,000 spindles, 1,200 looms, and 2,000 employees.  in 1928, a mill store and community center were built, followed the next year by a larger school.production slowed during the great depression, and ground to a halt in 1934.  from july 17 until september 22, 1934, a strike by the united textile workers of america brought violence to huntsville.  although business rebounded during world war ii, no further expansions of the mill or village were made.  in 1953, longtime superintendent phillip w. peeler retired, and the new management clashed often with the union.  another strike in 1955 turned violent, and lawsuits reached the supreme court, but were not heard before the mill closed.  the mill buildings were converted to offices, some of which were used by the space industry; the apollo lunar roving vehicle was designed in the mill by brown engineering.  the oldest two mills, along oakwood avenue, were destroyed by fire in february 1980.  the remaining mill no. 3 has been renovated to house a variety of tenants, including offices, a microbrewery, loft apartments, and a school focusing on children with learning disabilities.  the remodeling focuses on using sustainable practices.


== architecture ==
the only surviving production structures are mill no. 3 and the adjoining dye house, both built in 1924.  both buildings are of reinforced concrete which was cast in place. the defining feature of the buildings are floor-to-ceiling multi-pane windows with steel muntins.  the lincoln school, built in 1929 and separately listed on the national register in 1982, echos this design, with large bays of windows separated by thick, concrete pilasters, although it contains more decorative details.  the company store, today used as a theater and antique shop, retains the same proportions but has more conventional windows along with street-level storefronts.
the remaining structures in the district are all residential.  most prominent is the two-story, colonial revival superintendent's house along meridian street, that has been renovated as offices for an adjacent auto repair shop.  the majority of the workers houses are duplexes, although there are also twelve extant apartment buildings and a handful of single-family homes.  the majority follow the type m plan, of a one-story, hipped roof duplex that is two rooms deep.  the double entries are covered with a shed roofed porch.  the apartments follow the type m style, but have multiple units attached to one another, and separate, gable roof porches.  other styles include type b, a rectangular, gable roofed plan with closely spaced entrance doors; type d, a one-story plan with a central chimney and steeper gable roof; type e, an l-shaped structure with a shed porch on the front; and type h, a ​1 1⁄2-story single-family design with a gable roof and shed roof dormer.  though mostly undecorated, the houses do show some basic craftsman detail, such as exposed wood rafter ends.  all houses are of wood-frame construction covered in stucco.

good bye lenin! (soundtrack),non_science,"good bye lenin! is the original soundtrack album of the film of the same title starring daniel brühl and katrin sass.
the music is composed by yann tiersen, with the exception of the non-instrumental version of ""summer 78"" sung by claire pichet.
this album has been released with the copy control protection system in some regions.


== analysis ==
parts of the soundtrack are reminiscent of yann tiersen's best known film work, the soundtrack for amélie, which was in turn strongly influenced by french music. in fact, one of the songs on amélie, ""comptine d'un autre été : l'après-midi"", was also used on good bye, lenin! during the scene of the family's first east-west berlin outing, although it does not appear on the soundtrack album.

fibroblast of connective tissue of glandular part of prostate,cell,"stroma (from greek  στρῶμα 'layer, bed, bed covering') is the part of a tissue or organ with a structural or connective role. it is made up of all the parts without specific functions of the organ - for example, connective tissue, blood vessels, ducts, etc. the other part, the parenchyma, consists of the cells that perform the function of the tissue or organ.there are multiple ways of classifying tissues: one classification scheme is based on tissue functions and another analyzes their cellular components. stromal tissue falls into the ""functional"" class that contributes to the body's support and movement. the cells which make up stroma tissues serve as a matrix in which the other cells are embedded. stroma is made of various types of stromal cells.
examples of stroma include:

stroma of iris
stroma of cornea
stroma of ovary
stroma of thyroid gland
stroma of thymus
stroma of bone marrow
lymph node stromal cell
multipotent stromal cell (mesenchymal stem cell)


== structure ==
stromal connective tissues are found in the stroma; this tissue belongs to the group connective tissue proper. the function of connective tissue proper is to secure the parenchymal tissue, including blood vessels and nerves of the stroma, and to construct organs and spread mechanical tension to reduce localised stress. stromal tissue is primarily made of extracellular matrix containing connective tissue cells. extracellular matrix is primarily composed of ground substance - a porous, hydrated gel, made mainly from proteoglycan aggregates - and connective tissue fibers. there are three types of fibers commonly found within the stroma: collagen type i, elastic, and reticular (collagen type iii) fibres.


=== cells ===
wandering cells - cells that migrate into the tissue from blood stream in response to a variety of stimuli; for example, immune system blood cells causing inflammatory response.
fixed cells - cells that are permanent inhabitants of the tissue.
fibroblast - produce  and secrete the organic parts of the ground substance and extracellular fibers of the matrix.


=== types ===
loose connective tissue - this type is mainly located under the epithelial membranes and glandular epithelium, attaching the epithelia to other tissues. it supports the blood vessels and nerves supplied to the epithelia. additionally, it serves as the main site of inflammatory response within the body.
dense irregular connective tissue - the function of this type is binding at a high tensile strength between tissues to convert tension from one point.

1983 british virgin islands general election,non_science,"general elections were held in the british virgin islands on 11 november 1983.  the result was a victory for the opposition united party in coalition with independent candidate cyril romney over the governing virgin islands party (vip) led by former chief minister lavity stoutt.  each major party won four seats, and cyril romney was the sole remaining elected independent.  accordingly, romney allegedly agree to join a coalition with whichever party would make him chief minister.  the vip declined to do so, but the up eventually agreed thereby winning the election despite securing a smaller overall percentage of the vote.
janice george served as the supervisor of elections.  turnout averaged 73.1% across the six districts that voted; the 1st district had the highest turnout (83.5%) and the 3rd district had the lowest (67.8%).1983 was the second election after the legislative council had been expanded from seven district seats to nine.  astonishingly, just like the previous election, fully one third of the seats up for election were not contested, with only a single candidate standing in the 7th, 8th and 9th districts.  for the 7th and 8th districts, this was the second consecutive general election when those seats went uncontested.
the election is also notable in that every single person who would ever serve as chief minister of the british virgin islands (excluding premiers) (stoutt, wheatley, romney and o'neal) was elected during the 1983 general election.
notable candidates who were elected for the first time included future leader of the opposition, e. walwyn brewley.

clonostachys rosea f. rosea,non_science,"clonostachys rosea f. rosea, also known as gliocladium roseum, is a species of fungus in the family bionectriaceae. it colonizes living plants as an endophyte, digests material in soil as a saprophyte and is also known as a parasite of other fungi and of nematodes. it produces a wide range of volatile organic compounds which are toxic to organisms including other fungi, bacteria, and insects, and is of interest as a biological pest control agent.


== biological control ==
clonostachys rosea protects plants against botrytis cinerea (""grey mold"") by suppressing  spore production. its hyphae have been found to coil around, penetrate, and grow inside the hyphae and conidia of b. cinerea.nematodes are infected by c. rosea when the fungus' conidia  attach to their cuticle and germinate, going on to produce germ tubes which penetrate the host's body and kill it.


== biofuels ==

in 2008 an isolate of clonostachys rosea (nrrl 50072) was identified as producing a series of volatile compounds that are similar to some existing fuels. however, the taxonomy of this isolate was later revised to ascocoryne sarcoides.

dapsone,antibiotic,"dapsone, also known as diaminodiphenyl sulfone (dds), is an antibiotic commonly used in combination with rifampicin and clofazimine for the treatment of leprosy. it is a second-line medication for the treatment and prevention of pneumocystis pneumonia and for the prevention of toxoplasmosis in those who have poor immune function. additionally, it has been used for acne, dermatitis herpetiformis, and various other skin conditions. dapsone is available both topically and by mouth.severe side effects may include a decrease in blood cells, red blood cell breakdown especially in those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (g-6-pd), or hypersensitivity. common side effects include nausea and loss of appetite. other side effects include liver inflammation and a number of types of skin rashes. while the safety of use during pregnancy is not entirely clear some physicians recommend that it be continued in those with leprosy. it is of the sulfone class.dapsone was first studied as an antibiotic in 1937. its use for leprosy began in 1945. it is on the world health organization's list of essential medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. the form, which is taken by mouth, is available as a generic drug and not very expensive.


== medical uses ==


=== infections ===
dapsone is commonly used in combination with rifampicin and clofazimine for the treatment of leprosy. it is also used to both treat and prevent pneumocystis pneumonia (pcp). it is also used for toxoplasmosis in people unable to tolerate trimethoprim with sulfamethoxazole.dapsone by mouth was one of the first medications used to treat moderate to severe acne vulgaris, and is still occasionally prescribed for the treatment of severe cases. a topical form of dapsone is also effective with potentially less side effects.it is unclear if the combination with pyrimethamine is useful in the prevention of malaria.


=== autoimmune disease ===
cutaneous lupus erythematosis. dapsone is effective and safe in persons with moderate, severe, or refractory cutaneous lupus erythematosis.
idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. dapsone is effective and safe for adjunctive glucocorticoid-sparing treatment of persons with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and is preferred over danazol or interferon alpha in those people with antinuclear antibodies.
chronic spontaneous urticaria. dapsone is effective and safe for treatment of second-line therapy for people with chronic spontaneous urticaria in those for whom antihistamines and other first-line agents have failed.
relapsing polychondritis. there are no clinical trials but there are many case reports that dapsone is effective at doses of 25 mg/day to 200 mg/day for treatment of relapsing polychondritis.


=== other ===
dermatitis herpetiformis in combination with a gluten-free diet.dapsone may be used to treat brown recluse spider bites that become necrotic.dapsone is the recommended treatment for erythema elevatum diutinum, as a review found that using oral dapsone alone was effective in 80% of early cases of the disease. however, dapsone can potentially cause severe side effects, meaning that sometimes steroids or other antibiotics should be used instead, although these alternative treatments are much less effective.an august 2015 review notes that dapsone is reported to be effective against generalized granuloma annulare.dapsone has been used as a monomer in the design of dye adsorbent polymers.


== contraindications and precautions ==
people with porphyria, anemia, cardiac disease, lung disease, hiv infection, g6pd deficiency, and liver impairment are at higher risks of adverse effects when using dapsone.
recommend using pulse oximeter 2x/day to monitor for methemoglobinemia.


== adverse effects ==
hypersensitivity reactions occur in 1.4% of persons treated with dapsone, and can be fatal in medical settings with low resources. it is a form of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (scars) in which a scars disorder, primarily the dress syndrome or a dress syndrome-like reaction occurs.


=== blood ===
the most prominent side-effects of this drug are dose-related hemolysis (which may lead to hemolytic anemia) and methemoglobinemia. about 20% of patients treated with dapsone suffer hemolysis and the side-effect is more common and severe in those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, leading to the dapsone-containing antimalarial combination lapdap being withdrawn from clinical use. a case of hemolysis in a neonate from dapsone in breast milk has been reported. agranulocytosis occurs rarely when dapsone is used alone but more frequently in combination regimens for malaria prophylaxis. abnormalities in white blood cell formation, including aplastic anemia, are rare, yet are the cause of the majority of deaths attributable to dapsone therapy.


=== liver ===
toxic hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported by the manufacturer. these toxic reactions may also occur as part of the dapsone hypersensitivity syndrome (a form of scars-see above) or dapsone syndrome (see below). dapsone is metabolized by the cytochrome p450 system, specifically isozymes cyp2d6, cyp2b6, cyp3a4, and cyp2c19. dapsone metabolites produced by the cytochrome p450 2c19 isozyme are associated with the methemoglobinemia side effect of the drug.


=== skin ===
when used topically, dapsone can cause mild skin irritation, redness, dry skin, burning, and itching. when used together with benzoyl peroxide products, temporary yellow or orange skin discolorations can occur.


=== other adverse effects ===
other adverse effects include nausea, headache, and rash (which are common), and insomnia, psychosis, and peripheral neuropathy. effects on the lung occur rarely and may be serious, though are generally reversible.


=== dapsone syndrome ===
hypersensitivity reactions occur in some patients. this reaction may be more frequent in patients receiving multiple-drug therapy.the reaction always involves a rash, may also include fever, jaundice, and eosinophilia, and is likely to be one manifestation of the scars reaction viz., the dress syndrome (see above). in general, these symptoms will occur within the first six weeks of therapy or not at all, and may be ameliorated by corticosteroid therapy.


== mechanism of action ==
as an antibacterial, dapsone inhibits bacterial synthesis of dihydrofolic acid, via competition with para-aminobenzoate for the active site of dihydropteroate synthase, thereby inhibiting nucleic acid synthesis. though structurally distinct from dapsone, the sulfonamide group of antibacterial drugs also work in this way.
as an anti-inflammatory, dapsone inhibits the myeloperoxidase-h2o2-halide-mediated cytotoxic system in polymorphonucleocytes. as part of the respiratory burst that neutrophils use to kill bacteria, myeloperoxidase converts hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) into hypochlorous acid (hocl). hocl is the most potent oxidant generated by neutrophils, and can cause significant tissue damage during inflammation. dapsone arrests myeloperoxidase in an inactive intermediate form, reversibly inhibiting the enzyme.  this prevents accumulation of hypochlorous acid, and reduces tissue damage during inflammation. myeloperoxidase inhibition has also been suggested as a neuron-sparing mechanism for reducing inflammation in neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer's disease and stroke.dapsone's anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects are thought to be its mechanism of action in treating dermatitis herpetiformis.dapsone is an odorless white to creamy-white crystalline powder with a slightly bitter taste.


== history ==


=== discovery ===

in the early 20th century, the german chemist paul ehrlich was developing theories of selective toxicity based largely on the ability of certain dyes to kill microbes. gerhard domagk, who would later win a nobel prize for his efforts, made a major breakthrough in 1932 with the discovery of the antibacterial prontosil red (sulfonamidochrysoidine). further investigation into the involved chemicals opened the way to sulfa drug and sulfone therapy, first with the discovery of sulfanilamide, the active agent of prontosil, by daniel bovet and his team at pasteur institute (1935), then with that of dapsone independently by ernest fourneau in france and gladwin buttle in the united kingdom.


=== proposed use in antimalarial drugs ===
the spread of drug-resistant malaria in africa has encouraged the development of new, low-cost antimalarial drugs. plasmodium falciparum, one of the plasmodium species that causes malaria, has developed resistance both to chloroquine and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, two of the most common treatments for malaria. artemisinin, another antimalarial drug, had been developed in the 1980s but was too expensive for large-scale use. this led glaxosmithkline to develop lapdap, a combination drug consisting of chlorproguanil and dapsone. lapdap was licensed in the united kingdom starting in october 2003.one advantage of lapdap was that chlorproguanil and dapsone are both low-cost drugs. another was that by virtue of being a combination drug, it was less likely to cause drug resistance. however, because dapsone causes hemolytic anemia in patients with g6pd deficiency, and because g6pd deficiency affects 10-25% of the population of sub-saharan africa, it was discovered that lapdap is not safe for use in africa. it was available in many african countries for four years before glaxosmithkline took it off the market in february 2008.


=== dapsone gel ===
dapsone had been reported in a few cases to effectively treat acne, but the risk of hemolytic anemia kept it from being widely used for this purpose. for many years scientists attempted to develop a topical formulation of dapsone that would be as effective against acne as oral dapsone, but without the hemolysis side effect. this was difficult to accomplish because dapsone is highly insoluble in aqueous solvents. in the early 2000s qlt usa developed aczone, a 5% dapsone gel that was shown to be effective against acne without causing clinically significant declines in hemoglobin levels, even in subjects with g6pd deficiency.  in february 2016, the fda approved a 7.5% dapsone gel.  this higher strength has the advantage of a once-daily application, versus twice-daily application of the 5% formulation.


== other uses ==
dapsone also find uses as a curing agent in the manufacture of paints, adhesives, composites, powder coats and printed circuit boards.

hilus cell of ovary,cell,"asparagales (asparagoid lilies) is an order of plants in modern classification systems such as the angiosperm phylogeny group (apg) and the angiosperm phylogeny web. the order takes its name from the type family asparagaceae and is placed in the monocots amongst the lilioid monocots. the order has only recently been recognized in classification systems. it was first put forward by huber in 1977 and later taken up in the dahlgren system of 1985 and then the apg in 1998, 2003 and 2009. before this, many of its families were assigned to the old order liliales, a very large order containing almost all monocots with colorful tepals and lacking starch in their endosperm. dna sequence analysis indicated that many of the taxa previously included in liliales should actually be redistributed over three orders, liliales, asparagales, and dioscoreales. the boundaries of the asparagales and of its families have undergone a series of changes in recent years; future research may lead to further changes and ultimately greater stability. in the apg circumscription, asparagales is the largest order of monocots with 14 families, 1,122 genera, and about 36,000 species.
the order is clearly circumscribed on the basis of molecular phylogenetics, but it is difficult to define morphologically since its members are structurally diverse. most species of asparagales are herbaceous perennials, although some are climbers and some are tree-like. the order also contains many geophytes (bulbs, corms, and various kinds of tuber). according to telomere sequence, at least two evolutionary switch-points happened within the order. the basal sequence is formed by tttaggg like in the majority of higher plants. basal motif was changed to vertebrate-like ttaggg and finally, the most divergent motif ctcggttatggg appears in allium. one of the defining characteristics (synapomorphies) of the order is the presence of phytomelanin, a black pigment present in the seed coat, creating a dark crust. phytomelanin is found in most families of the asparagales (although not in orchidaceae, thought to be the sister-group of the rest of the order).
the leaves of almost all species form a tight rosette, either at the base of the plant or at the end of the stem, but occasionally along the stem. the flowers are not particularly distinctive, being 'lily type', with six tepals and up to six stamina.
the order is thought to have first diverged from other related monocots some 120–130 million years ago (early in the cretaceous period), although given the difficulty in classifying the families involved, estimates are likely to be uncertain.
from an economic point of view, the order asparagales is second in importance within the monocots to the order poales (which includes grasses and cereals). species are used as food and flavourings (e.g. onion, garlic, leek, asparagus, vanilla, saffron), in medicinal or cosmetic applications (aloe), as cut flowers (e.g. freesia, gladiolus, iris, orchids), and as garden ornamentals (e.g. day lilies, lily of the valley, agapanthus).


== description ==

although most species in the order are herbaceous, some no more than 15 cm high, there are a number of climbers (e.g., some species of asparagus), as well as several genera forming trees (e.g. agave, cordyline, yucca, dracaena, aloe ), which can exceed 10 m in height. succulent genera occur in several families (e.g. aloe).
almost all species have a tight cluster of leaves (a rosette), either at the base of the plant or at the end of a more-or-less woody stem as with yucca. in some cases, the leaves are produced along the stem. the flowers are in the main not particularly distinctive, being of a general 'lily type', with six tepals, either free or fused from the base and up to six stamina. they are frequently clustered at the end of the plant stem.
the asparagales are generally distinguished from the liliales by the lack of markings on the tepals, the presence of septal nectaries in the ovaries, rather than the bases of the tepals or stamen filaments, and the presence of secondary growth. they are generally geophytes, but with linear leaves, and a lack of fine reticular venation.
the seeds characteristically have the external epidermis either obliterated (in most species bearing fleshy fruit), or if present, have a layer of black carbonaceous phytomelanin in species with dry fruits (nuts). the inner part of the seed coat is generally collapsed, in contrast to liliales whose seeds have a well developed outer epidermis, lack phytomelanin, and usually display a cellular inner layer.
the orders which have been separated from the old liliales are difficult to characterize. no single morphological character appears to be diagnostic of the order asparagales.

the flowers of asparagales are of a general type among the lilioid monocots. compared to liliales, they usually have plain tepals without markings in the form of dots. if nectaries are present, they are in the septa of the ovaries rather than at the base of the tepals or stamens.
those species which have relatively large dry seeds have a dark, crust-like (crustose) outer layer containing the pigment phytomelan. however, some species with hairy seeds (e.g. eriospermum, family asparagaceae s.l.), berries (e.g. maianthemum, family asparagaceae s.l.), or highly reduced seeds (e.g. orchids) lack this dark pigment in their seed coats. phytomelan is not unique to asparagales (i.e. it is not a synapomorphy) but it is common within the order and rare outside it. the inner portion of the seed coat is usually completely collapsed. in contrast, the morphologically similar seeds of liliales have no phytomelan, and usually retain a cellular structure in the inner portion of the seed coat.
most monocots are unable to thicken their stems once they have formed, since they lack the cylindrical meristem present in other angiosperm groups. asparagales have a method of secondary thickening which is otherwise only found indioscorea (in the order disoscoreales). in a process called 'anomalous secondary growth', they are able to create new vascular bundles around which thickening growth occurs. agave, yucca, aloe, dracaena, nolina and cordyline can become massive trees, albeit not of the height of the tallest dicots, and with less branching. other genera in the order, such as lomandra and aphyllanthes, have the same type of secondary growth but confined to their underground stems.
microsporogenesis (part of pollen formation) distinguishes some members of asparagales from liliales. microsporogenesis involves a cell dividing twice (meiotically) to form four daughter cells. there are two kinds of microsporogenesis: successive and simultaneous (although intermediates exist). in successive microsporogenesis, walls are laid down separating the daughter cells after each division. in simultaneous microsporogenesis, there is no wall formation until all four cell nuclei are present. liliales all have successive microsporogenesis, which is thought to be the primitive condition in monocots. it seems that when the asparagales first diverged they developed simultaneous microsporogenesis, which the 'lower' asparagale families retain. however, the 'core' asparagales (see #phylogeny section) have reverted to successive microsporogenesis.
the asparagales appear to be unified by a mutation affecting their telomeres (a region of repetitive dna at the end of a chromosome). the typical 'arabidopsis-type' sequence of bases has been fully or partially replaced by other sequences, with the 'human-type' predominating.
other apomorphic characters of the order according to stevens are: the presence of chelidonic acid, anthers longer than wide, tapetal cells bi- to tetra-nuclear, tegmen not persistent, endosperm helobial, and loss of mitochondrial gene sdh3.


== taxonomy ==
as circumscribed within the angiosperm phylogeny group system asparagales is the largest order within the monocotyledons, with 14 families, 1,122 genera and about 25,000–42,000 species, thus accounting for about 50% of all monocots and 10–15% of the flowering plants (angiosperms). the attribution of botanical authority for the name asparagales belongs to johann heinrich friedrich link (1767–1851) who coined the word 'asparaginae' in 1829 for a higher order taxon that included asparagus although adanson and jussieau had also done so earlier (see history). earlier circumscriptions of asparagales attributed the name to bromhead (1838), who had been the first to use the term 'asparagales'.


=== history ===


==== pre-darwinian ====
the type genus, asparagus, from which the name of the order is derived, was described by carl linnaeus in 1753, with ten species. he placed asparagus within the hexandria monogynia (six stamens, one carpel) in his sexual classification in the species plantarum. the majority of taxa now considered to constitute asparagales have historically been placed within the very large and diverse family, liliaceae. the family liliaceae was first described by michel adanson in 1763, and in his taxonomic scheme he created eight sections within it, including the asparagi with asparagus and three other genera. the system of organising genera into families is generally credited to antoine laurent de jussieu who formally described both the liliaceae and the type family of asparagales, the asparagaceae, as lilia and asparagi, respectively, in 1789. jussieu established the hierarchical system of taxonomy (phylogeny), placing asparagus and related genera within a division of monocotyledons, a class (iii) of stamina perigynia and 'order' asparagi, divided into three subfamilies. the use of the term ordo (order) at that time was closer to what we now understand as family, rather than order. in creating his scheme he used a modified form of linnaeus' sexual classification but using the respective topography of stamens to carpels rather than just their numbers. while de jussieu's stamina perigynia also included a number of 'orders' that would eventually form families within the asparagales such as the asphodeli (asphodelaceae), narcissi (amaryllidaceae) and irides (iridaceae), the remainder are now allocated to other orders. jussieu's asparagi soon came to be referred to as asparagacées in the french literature (latin: asparagaceae). meanwhile, the 'narcissi' had been renamed as the 'amaryllidées' (amaryllideae) in 1805, by jean henri jaume saint-hilaire, using amaryllis as the type species rather than narcissus, and thus has the authority attribution for amaryllidaceae. in 1810 brown proposed that a subgroup of liliaceae be distinguished on the basis of the position of the ovaries and be referred to as amaryllideae and in 1813 de candolle described liliacées juss. and amaryllidées brown as two quite separate families.the literature on the organisation of genera into families and higher ranks became available in the english language with samuel frederick gray's a natural arrangement of british plants (1821). gray used a combination of linnaeus' sexual classification and jussieu's natural classification to group together a number of families having in common six equal stamens, a single style and a perianth that was simple and petaloid, but did not use formal names for these higher ranks. within the grouping he separated families by the characteristics of their fruit and seed. he treated groups of genera with these characteristics as separate families, such as amaryllideae, liliaceae, asphodeleae and asparageae.

the circumscription of asparagales has been a source of difficulty for many botanists from the time of john lindley (1846), the other important british taxonomist of the early nineteenth century. in his first taxonomic work, an introduction to the natural system of botany (1830) he partly followed jussieu by describing a subclass he called endogenae, or monocotyledonous plants (preserving de candolle's endogenæ phanerogamæ) divided into two tribes, the petaloidea and glumaceae. he divided the former, often referred to as petaloid monocots, into 32 orders, including the liliaceae (defined narrowly), but also most of the families considered to make up the asparagales today, including the amaryllideae.
by 1846, in his final scheme lindley had greatly expanded and refined the treatment of the monocots, introducing both an intermediate ranking (alliances) and tribes within orders (i.e. families). lindley placed the liliaceae within the liliales, but saw it as a paraphyletic (""catch-all"") family, being all liliales not included in the other orders, but hoped that the future would reveal some characteristic that would group them better. the order liliales was very large and had become a used to include almost all monocotyledons with colourful tepals and without starch in their endosperm (the lilioid monocots). the liliales was difficult to divide into families because morphological characters were not present in patterns that clearly demarcated groups. this kept the liliaceae separate from the amaryllidaceae (narcissales). of these liliaceae was divided into eleven tribes (with 133 genera) and amaryllidaceae into four tribes (with 68 genera), yet both contained many genera that would eventually segregate to each other's contemporary orders (liliales and asparagales respectively). the liliaceae would be reduced to a small 'core' represented by the tribe tulipae, while large groups such scilleae and asparagae would become part of asparagales either as part of the amaryllidaceae or as separate families. while of the amaryllidaceae, the agaveae would be part of asparagaceae but the alstroemeriae would become a family within the liliales.
the number of known genera (and species) continued to grow and by the time of the next major british classification, that of the bentham & hooker system in 1883 (published in latin) several of lindley's other families had been absorbed into the liliaceae. they used the term 'series' to indicate suprafamilial rank, with seven series of monocotyledons (including glumaceae), but did not use lindley's terms for these. however they did place the liliaceous and amaryllidaceous genera into separate series. the liliaceae were placed in series coronariae, while the amaryllideae were placed in series epigynae. the liliaceae now consisted of twenty tribes (including tulipeae, scilleae and asparageae), and the amaryllideae of five (including agaveae and alstroemerieae). an important addition to the treatment of the liliaceae was the recognition of the allieae as a distinct tribe that would eventually find its way to the asparagales as the subfamily allioideae of the amaryllidaceae.


==== post-darwinian ====
the appearance of charles darwin's origin of species in 1859 changed the way that taxonomists considered plant classification, incorporating evolutionary information into their schemata. the darwinian approach led to the concept of phylogeny (tree-like structure) in assembling classification systems, starting with eichler. eichler, having established a hierarchical system in which the flowering plants (angiosperms) were divided into monocotyledons and dicotyledons, further divided into former into seven orders. within the liliiflorae were seven families, including liliaceae and amaryllidaceae. liliaceae included allium and ornithogalum (modern allioideae) and asparagus.engler, in his system developed eichler's ideas into a much more elaborate scheme which he treated in a number of works including die natürlichen pflanzenfamilien (engler and prantl 1888) and syllabus der pflanzenfamilien (1892–1924). in his treatment of liliiflorae the liliineae were a suborder which included both families liliaceae and amaryllidaceae. the liliaceae had eight subfamilies and the amaryllidaceae four. in this rearrangement of liliaceae, with fewer subdivisions, the core liliales were represented as subfamily lilioideae (with tulipae and scilleae as tribes), the asparagae were represented as asparagoideae and the allioideae was preserved, representing the alliaceous genera. allieae, agapantheae and gilliesieae were the three tribes within this subfamily. in the amaryllidacea, there was little change from the bentham & hooker. a similar approach was adopted by wettstein.


==== twentieth century ====
in the twentieth century the wettstein system (1901–1935) placed many of the taxa in an order called 'liliiflorae'. next johannes paulus lotsy (1911) proposed dividing the liliiflorae into a number of smaller families including asparagaceae. then herbert huber (1969, 1977), following lotsy's example, proposed that the liliiflorae be split into four groups including the  'asparagoid' liliiflorae.the widely used cronquist system (1968–1988) used the very broadly defined order liliales.
these various proposals to separate small groups of genera into more homogeneous families made little impact till that of dahlgren (1985) incorporating new information including synapomorphy. dahlgren developed huber's ideas further and popularised them, with a major deconstruction of existing families into smaller units. they created a new order, calling it asparagales. this was one of five orders within the superorder liliiflorae. where cronquist saw one family, dahlgren saw forty distributed over three orders (predominantly liliales and asparagales).
over the 1980s, in the context of a more general review of the classification of angiosperms, the liliaceae were subjected to more intense scrutiny. by the end of that decade, the royal botanic gardens at kew, the british museum of natural history and the edinburgh botanical gardens formed a committee to examine the possibility of separating the family at least for the organization of their herbaria. that committee finally recommended that 24 new families be created in the place of the original broad liliaceae, largely by elevating subfamilies to the rank of separate families.


=== phylogenetics ===
the order asparagales as currently circumscribed has only recently been recognized in classification systems, through the advent of phylogenetics. the 1990s saw considerable progress in plant phylogeny and phylogenetic theory, enabling a phylogenetic tree to be constructed for all of the flowering plants. the establishment of major new clades necessitated a departure from the older but widely used classifications such as cronquist and thorne based largely on morphology rather than genetic data. this complicated discussion about plant evolution and necessitated a major restructuring. rbcl gene sequencing and cladistic analysis of monocots had redefined the liliales in 1995. from four morphological orders sensu dahlgren. the largest clade representing the liliaceae, all previously included in liliales, but including both the calochortaceae and liliaceae sensu tamura. this redefined family, that became referred to as core liliales, but corresponded to the emerging circumscription of the angiosperm phylogeny group (1998).


=== phylogeny and apg system ===
the 2009 revision of the angiosperm phylogeny group system, apg iii, places the order in the clade monocots.from the dahlgren system of 1985 onwards, studies based mainly on morphology had identified the asparagales as a distinct group, but had also included groups now located in liliales, pandanales and zingiberales. research in the 21st century has supported the monophyly of asparagales, based on morphology, 18s rdna, and other dna sequences, although some phylogenetic reconstructions based on molecular data have suggested that asparagales may be paraphyletic, with orchidaceae separated from the rest. within the monocots, asparagales is the sister group of the commelinid clade.this cladogram shows the placement of asparagales within the orders of lilianae sensu chase & reveal (monocots) based on molecular phylogenetic evidence. the lilioid monocot orders are bracketed, namely petrosaviales, dioscoreales, pandanales, liliales and asparagales. these constitute a paraphyletic assemblage, that is groups with a common ancestor that do not include all direct descendants (in this case commelinids as the sister group to asparagales); to form a clade, all the groups joined by thick lines would need to be included. while acorales and alismatales have been collectively referred to as ""alismatid monocots"" (basal or early branching monocots), the remaining clades (lilioid and commelinid monocots) have been referred to as the ""core monocots"". the relationship between the orders (with the exception of the two sister orders) is pectinate, that is diverging in succession from the line that leads to the commelinids. numbers indicate crown group (most recent common ancestor of the sampled species of the clade of interest) divergence times in mya (million years ago).


=== subdivision ===
a phylogenetic tree for the asparagales, generally to family level, but including groups which were recently and widely treated as families but which are now reduced to subfamily rank, is shown below.
the tree shown above can be divided into a basal paraphyletic group, the 'lower asparagales (asparagoids)', from orchidaceae to asphodelaceae, and a well-supported monophyletic group of 'core asparagales' (higher asparagoids), comprising the two largest families, amaryllidaceae sensu lato and asparagaceae sensu lato.two differences between these two groups (although with exceptions) are: the mode of microsporogenesis and the position of the ovary. the 'lower asparagales' typically have simultaneous microsporogenesis (i.e. cell walls develop only after both meiotic divisions), which appears to be an apomorphy within the monocots, whereas the 'core asparagales' have reverted to successive microsporogenesis (i.e. cell walls develop after each division). the 'lower asparagales' typically have an inferior ovary, whereas the 'core asparagales' have reverted to a superior ovary. a 2002 morphological study by rudall treated possessing an inferior ovary as a synapomorphy of the asparagales, stating that reversions to a superior ovary in the 'core asparagales' could be associated with the presence of nectaries below the ovaries. however, stevens notes that superior ovaries are distributed among the 'lower asparagales' in such a way that it is not clear where to place the evolution of different ovary morphologies. the position of the ovary seems a much more flexible character (here and in other angiosperms) than previously thought.


==== changes to family structure in apg iii ====
the apg iii system when it was published in 2009, greatly expanded the families xanthorrhoeaceae, amaryllidaceae, and asparagaceae. thirteen of the families of the earlier apg ii system were thereby reduced to subfamilies within these three families. the expanded xanthorrhoeaceae is now called ""asphodelaceae"". the apg ii families (left) and their equivalent apg iii subfamilies (right) are as follows:


==== structure of asparagales ====


===== orchid clade =====
orchidaceae is the largest family of all angiosperms and hence by far the largest in the order. the dahlgren system recognized three families of orchids, but dna sequence analysis later showed that these families are polyphyletic and so should be combined. several studies suggest (with high bootstrap support) that orchidaceae is the sister of the rest of the asparagales. other studies have placed the orchids differently in the phylogenetic tree, generally among the boryaceae-hypoxidaceae clade. the position of orchidaceae shown above seems the best current hypothesis, but cannot be taken as confirmed.
orchids have simultaneous microsporogenesis and inferior ovaries, two characters that are typical of the 'lower asparagales'. however, their nectaries are rarely in the septa of the ovaries, and most orchids have dust-like seeds, atypical of the rest of the order. (some members of vanilloideae and cypripedioideae have crustose seeds, probably associated with dispersal by birds and mammals that are attracted by fermenting fleshy fruit releasing fragrant compounds, e.g. vanilla.)
in terms of the number of species, orchidaceae diversification is remarkable. however, although the other asparagales may be less rich in species, they are more variable morphologically, including tree-like forms.


===== boryaceae to hypoxidaceae =====
the four families excluding boryaceae form a well-supported clade in studies based on dna sequence analysis. all four contain relatively few species, and it has been suggested that they be combined into one family under the name hypoxidaceae sensu lato. the relationship between boryaceae (which includes only two genera, borya and alania), and other asparagales has remained unclear for a long time. the boryaceae are mycorrhizal, but not in the same way as orchids. morphological studies have suggested a close relationship between boryaceae and blandfordiaceae. there is relatively low support for the position of boryaceae in the tree shown above.


===== ixioliriaceae to xeronemataceae =====
the relationship shown between ixioliriaceae and tecophilaeaceae is still unclear. some studies have supported a clade of these two families, others have not. the position of doryanthaceae has also varied, with support for the position shown above, but also support for other positions.the clade from iridaceae upwards appears to have stronger support. all have some genetic characteristics in common, having lost arabidopsis-type telomeres. iridaceae is distinctive among the asparagales in the unique structure of the inflorescence (a rhipidium), the combination of an inferior ovary and three stamens, and the common occurrence of unifacial leaves whereas bifacial leaves are the norm in other asparagales.
members of the clade from iridaceae upwards have infra-locular septal nectaries, which rudall interpreted as a driver towards secondarily superior ovaries.


===== asphodelaceae + 'core asparagales' =====
the next node in the tree (xanthorrhoeaceae sensu lato + the 'core asparagales') has strong support. 'anomalous' secondary thickening occurs among this clade, e.g. in xanthorrhoea (family asphodelaceae) and dracaena (family asparagaceae sensu lato), with species reaching tree-like proportions.
the 'core asparagales', comprising amaryllidaceae sensu lato and asparagaceae sensu lato, are a strongly supported clade, as are clades for each of the families. relationships within these broadly defined families appear less clear, particularly within the asparagaceae sensu lato. stevens notes that most of its subfamilies are difficult to recognize, and that significantly different divisions have been used in the past, so that the use of a broadly defined family to refer to the entire clade is justified. thus the relationships among subfamilies shown above, based on apweb as of december 2010, is somewhat uncertain.


=== evolution ===
several studies have attempted to date the evolution of the asparagales, based on phylogenetic evidence. earlier studies generally give younger dates than more recent studies, which have been preferred in the table below.

a 2009 study suggests that the asparagales have the highest diversification rate in the monocots, about the same as the order poales, although in both orders the rate is little over half that of the eudicot order lamiales, the clade with the highest rate.


=== comparison of family structures ===
 
the taxonomic diversity of the monocotyledons is described in detail by kubitzki. up-to-date information on the asparagales can be found on the angiosperm phylogeny website.the apg iii system's family circumscriptions are being used as the basis of the kew-hosted world checklist of selected plant families. with this circumscription, the order consists of 14 families (dahlgren had 31) with approximately 1120 genera and 26000 species.order asparagales link

two older systems which use the order asparagales are the dahlgren system and the kubitzki system. the families included in the circumscriptions of the order in these two systems are shown in the first and second columns of the table below. the equivalent family in the modern apg iii system (see below) is shown in the third column. note that although these systems may use the same name for a family, the genera which it includes may be different, so the equivalence between systems is only approximate in some cases.

baku puppet theatre,non_science,"the baku puppet theatre (formally azerbaijan state puppet theatre named after abdulla shaig , azerbaijani: abdulla şaiq adına azərbaycan dövlət kukla teatrı) is located on neftchiler avenue of baku. it was built in 1910 by polish architect józef płoszko, initially as the french renaissance ""phenomenon"" movie theater.the puppets vary in size from a few centimetres to double the size of a human.


== overview ==
the theatre building was erected at the baku boulevard when there was no greenery yet. the exhaust ventilation system was superseded by forced ventilation. when the movie theater was opened to the public in june 1910, its administration advertised the features of full air change, occurring every 15 minutes and special ozonator.auditorium hall of the movie theater was 24 m. in length, 11 m. in width, 10 m. in height. 400 seats were available in parterre. additionally there were 7 loges, and in upper section 3 verandas.


== history ==


=== history of the building ===
the first owner of “phenomenon” cinema was m.gofman. it was planning to rent the cinema hall for spectacles. entrepreneurs were arranging a permission from city authorities to enlarge the building in the future. as a result, the architectural appearance of the building was completed by the monuments of 4 ancient mythological figures – mercury, bacchus, poseidon and aphrodite.in 1921, according to project of azerbaijani architect zivar bey ahmadbeyov the building was cardinally rebuilt for theatre ""satyragite"".“phenomenon” operated as cinema, casino, satyrogite theatre, musical comedy theater and museum of agricultural achievements till 1931.


=== history of puppet theatre ===
the idea to establish puppet theatre in state level was introduced by the organizer of theater museum, actor molla agha babirli. on the initiative of theater activists led by jafar jabbarly, puppet theatre was founded in 1931 by the decision of education commission. the first spectacle of the theatre was “circus” played in 1932.puppet theatre operated independently in 1931-1941, and in 1946-1950, under azerbaijan state theatre of young spectators in 1941-1946 and azerbaijan state philharmonic hall in 1950. in 1964 “state” status was given to the theatre.since 1975 plays for adult audience have been performing as well.

we must love,non_science,"we must love is the third extended play from south korean–japanese boy group onf. it was released on february 7, 2019 by wm entertainment and distributed by stone music entertainment. consisted of five dominantly edm and dance-pop tracks, the extended play was produced and written mostly by production team monotree, with member mk and wyatt contributed lyrically. upon its release, we must love became the group's longest charting release to date on the gaon album chart, peaking at number five for one week and stayed for fourteen consecutive weeks on the chart, eventually became the twenty-fourth best selling release of february 2019. it was also the group's last release to feature founding member laun, whom left the group six months after its release. 
to further promote the extended play, onf released its eponymous title track as the lead single from the extended play and proceeded with their first asian tour with the same name in march 2019. though uncharted, ""we must love"" has since become the group's signature song and one of their most recognized tunes. 


== background and release ==
on january 28, 2019, wm entertainment announced that onf would release their third extended play on february 7, 2019, marking the group's first music release following their second japanese single ""complete"" in september 2018, and subsequently their first korean release in eight months following you complete me in june 2018. in addition, the label unveiled onf's teaser images on their official social media platforms, portraying a half-open image in a pink envelope stamped with on and off (onf) stamps and contains a big letter with the message ""#ㅅㄹㅎㄱㄷㄱㅇ"", which was the korean abbreviation for their upcoming album title. two days later, wm entertainment unveiled the first group pyro-photograph with all members wearing black and red costume, showcasing a ""dark"" and more ""mature"" image transition from their previous ""bubbly"" and ""bright"" images. the entire tracklist was then revealed on february 1. the label then released both ""we must love"" and its parental extended play on all south korean digital platforms on february 7, while the physical edition was released a day later.


== promotion ==
following the release of we must love, the group held an album showcase at the k-art hall at olympic park, seoul, where they performed live the title track and ""yayaya"" for the first time. onf then started their initial promotion on various south korean television music programs, starting with their appearance on kbs's music bank on february 8 and followed by performances on the show, show! music core, m countdown and show champion. the group then expanded their promotion with ""we must love asia tour 2019"", their first asian tour since the group's debut in march and april, and later participated at the kcon japan 2019 music festival on may 18, 2019. the title track was then sampled and eventually re-arranged for the group's participation in road to kingdom, the male counterpart reality television program of queendom that features seven rising boy groups competing with live performances of their previous singles and new recording.

idraparinux,drug,"idraparinux sodium is an anticoagulant medication in development by sanofi-aventis.it has a similar chemical structure and the same method of action as fondaparinux, but with an elimination half-life about five to six times longer (an increase from fondaparinux's 17 hours to approximately 80 hours), which means that the drug should only need to be injected once a week.supriya dey et al recently reported shortest chemical synthesis of idraparinux for the large scale production[8].
sanofi discontinued the development of idraparinux sodium.


== negative clinical trial ==
a phase iii trial of idraparinux sodium for stroke prevention in patients with af (amadeus) was halted prematurely due to excessive clinically relevant and intracranial bleeding. bleedings were particularly increased in elderly patients and those with renal impairment.  sanofi discontinued the development of idraparinux sodium in favour of a biotinylated formulation of the drug called idrabiotaparinux sodium.


== method of action ==
idraparinux selectively blocks coagulation factor xa.see heparin: mechanism of anticoagulant action for a comparison of the mechanism of heparin, low-molecular-weight heparins, fondaparinux and idraparinux.


== idrabiotaparinux ==
idrabiotaparinux sodium is also administered once-weekly. it has the same pentasaccharidic structure as idraparinux sodium, but with biotin
attached, which allows its neutralisation with avidin, an egg-derived protein with low antigenicity.
sanofi conducted three phase iii trials of idrabiotaparinux sodium between 2006 and 2008 in approximately 13,550 patients. in one phase iii trial (the borealis-af study), idrabiotaparinux sodium was non-inferior to warfarin in preventing the recurrent venous thromboembolism at three months in patients with pulmonary embolism and the incidence of clinically relevant bleeding was lower in the idrabiotaparinux sodium arm. the drug was expected to be filed for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation in 2011. the study was prematurely terminated, and the reason remains unclear. however, sanofi has since discontinued its development. the company announced in may 2011 that the drug is available for licensing. a systematic review found that until now there is not sufficient evidence to clarify whether idraparinux or idrabiotaparinux are as effective and safe as the standard warfarin treatment for venous thromboembolism prevention. idraparinux or idrabiotaparinux decreased major bleeding rate significantly but had a trend to increase the all-cause mortality compared with warfarin.

drebrin-like protein isoform h2 (human),protein,"single-minded homolog 2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the sim2 gene. it plays a major role in the development of the central nervous system midline as well as the construction of the face and head.


== function ==
sim1 and sim2 genes are drosophila single-minded (sim) gene homologs. the drosophila sim gene encodes a transcription factor that is a master regulator of neurogenesis of midline cells in the central nervous system. sim2 maps within the so-called down syndrome chromosomal region, specifically on the q arm of chromosome 21, band 22.2.  based on the mapping position, its potential function as transcriptional repressor and similarity to drosophila sim, it is proposed that sim2 may contribute to some specific down syndrome phenotypes


== interactions ==
sim2 has been shown to interact with aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator.when the sim2 gene is tranfected into pc12 cells, it effects the normal cycle of cell maturation. sim2 inhibits the expression of cyclin e, which in turn inhibits the cell's ability to pass through the g1/s checkpoint and suppresses the cell's proliferation ability. it also up-regulates the presence of p27, a growth inhibitor protein. the presence of p27 inhibits the activation of cell cycle regulatory kinases.


== disease state ==
there are three states of the gene: +/+, +/-, and -/-. when the gene is expressed as sim2 -/-, it is considered disrupted and many physical malformations are seen, particularly in the craniofacial area. individuals with sim2 -/- have either a full or partial secondary palate cleft and malformations in the tongue and pterygoid processes of the sphenoid bone. these malformations cause aerophagia, or the swallowing of air, and postnatal death. severe aerophagia leads to accumulation of air in the gastrointestinal tract, causing the belly to be distended.
it is thought that the over-expression of the sim2 gene brings about some of the phenotypic deformities that are characteristic of down syndrome. the presence of sim2 mrna in many parts of the brain known to show deformities in individuals with down syndrome, as well as in the palate, oral and tongue epithelia, mandibular and hyoid bones.


== sim2 short (sim2s) ==
there are two known isoforms of sim2 which play different roles in various tissues. the isoform sim2 short (sim2s) has been shown to be specifically expressed in mammary gland tissue. sim2s is a splice variant which lacks exon 11 of sim2. it has been researched that sim2s acts in mammary gland development and has tumor suppressive characteristics specifically in breast cancer. in a mouse specimen, when sim2s was not expressed in mammary epithelial cells there were development defects leading to cancer-like characteristics in the cells. the defects were increased cell proliferation, cellular invasion of local stroma, loss of cellular polarity, and loss of e-cadherin cellular adhesion molecules. these observations suggest that sim2s is essential for proper mammary gland development. experiments reintroducing sim2s in human breast cancer cells allowed for the tumor suppressive characteristics to be observed. comparing normal human breast cells to human breast cancer cells with immunohistochemical staining showed that sim2s was expressed more in the normal than the cancerous. reintroducing sim2s expression in breast cancer cells showed a decrease in growth, proliferation, and invasiveness. sim2s represses the actions of the matrix metalloprotease-3 gene (mmp3) which include cell migration, cancer progression, and epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (emt). sim2s also represses the slug transcription factor which in turn suppresses emt. emt suppression allows for e-cadherin to remain and for the cell to not undergo pathological emt associated with tumor formation. these actions show the tumor suppressive effects of sim2s in mammary epithelium.


== knockout model ==
scientists can purposefully ""knockout"" or cause the gene to be disrupted. to do this, they perform homologous recombination and eliminate the predicted start codon and the following 47 amino acids. then the ecori restriction site is introduced into the chromosome.

von neumann–wigner interpretation,non_science,"the von neumann–wigner interpretation, also described as ""consciousness causes collapse"", is an interpretation of quantum mechanics in which consciousness is postulated to be necessary for the completion of the process of quantum measurement.


== background: observation in quantum mechanics ==
in the orthodox copenhagen interpretation, quantum mechanics predicts only the probabilities for different observed experimental outcomes. what constitutes an observer or an observation is not directly specified by the theory, and the behavior of a system under measurement and observation is completely different from its usual behavior: the wavefunction that describes a system spreads out into an ever-larger superposition of different possible situations. however, during observation, the wavefunction describing the system collapses to one of several options. if there is no observation, this collapse does not occur, and none of the options ever becomes less likely.
it can be predicted using quantum mechanics, absent a collapse postulate, that an observer observing a quantum superposition will turn into a superposition of different observers seeing different things. the observer will have a wavefunction which describes all the possible outcomes. still, in actual experience, an observer never senses a superposition, but always senses that one of the outcomes has occurred with certainty. this apparent conflict between a wavefunction description and classical experience is called the problem of observation (see measurement problem).

in his 1932 book the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics, john von neumann argued that the mathematics of quantum mechanics allows the collapse of the wave function to be placed at any position in the causal chain from the measurement device to the ""subjective perception"" of the human observer.  in 1939, fritz london and edmond bauer argued for the latter boundary (consciousness).  in the 1960s, eugene wigner reformulated the ""schrödinger's cat"" thought experiment as ""wigner's friend"" and proposed that the consciousness of an observer is the demarcation line that precipitates collapse of the wave function, independent of any realist interpretation.  see consciousness and measurement. the non-physical mind is postulated to be the only true measurement apparatus.this interpretation has been summarized thus:

the rules of quantum mechanics are correct but there is only one system which may be treated with quantum mechanics, namely the entire material world. there exist external observers which cannot be treated within quantum mechanics, namely human (and perhaps animal) minds, which perform measurements on the brain causing wave function collapse.

henry stapp has argued for the concept as follows:

from the point of view of the mathematics of quantum theory it makes no sense to treat a measuring device as intrinsically different from the collection of atomic constituents that make it up. a device is just another part of the physical universe...  moreover, the conscious thoughts of a human observer ought to be causally connected most directly and immediately to what is happening in his brain, not to what is happening out at some measuring device...  our bodies and brains thus become ... parts of the quantum mechanically described physical universe. treating the entire physical universe in this unified way provides a conceptually simple and logically coherent theoretical foundation...


== objections to the interpretation ==
there are other possible solutions to the ""wigner's friend"" thought experiment, which do not require consciousness to be different from other physical processes.  moreover, wigner actually shifted to those interpretations (and away from ""consciousness causes collapse"") in his later years. this was partly because he was embarrassed that ""consciousness causes collapse"" can lead to a kind of solipsism, but also because he decided that he had been wrong to try to apply quantum physics at the scale of everyday life (specifically, he rejected his initial idea of treating macroscopic objects as isolated systems). see consciousness and superposition.
this interpretation relies upon an interactionist form of dualism that is inconsistent with the materialism that is commonly used to understand the brain, and accepted by most scientists.  (materialism assumes that consciousness has no special role in relation to quantum mechanics.)  the measurement problem notwithstanding, they point to a causal closure of physics, suggesting a problem with how consciousness and matter might interact, reminiscent of objections to descartes' substance dualism.

the only form of interactionist dualism that has seemed even remotely tenable in the contemporary picture is one that exploits certain properties of quantum mechanics. there are two ways this might go. first, some [e.g., eccles 1986] have appealed to the existence of quantum indeterminacy, and have suggested that a nonphysical consciousness might be responsible for filling the resultant causal gaps, determining which values some physical magnitudes might take within an apparently ""probabilistic"" distribution… this is an audacious and interesting suggestion, but it has a number of problems… a second way in which quantum mechanics bears on the issue of causal closure lies with the fact that in some interpretations of the quantum formalism, consciousness itself plays a vital causal role, being required to bring about the so-called ""collapse of the wave-function."" this collapse is supposed to occur upon any act of measurement; and in one interpretation, the only way to distinguish a measurement from a nonmeasurement is via the presence of consciousness. this theory is certainly not universally accepted (for a start, it presupposes that consciousness is not itself physical, surely contrary to the views of most physicists), and i do not accept it myself, but in any case it seems that the kind of causal work consciousness performs here is quite different from the kind required for consciousness to play a role in directing behavior… in any case, all versions of interactionist dualism have a conceptual problem that suggests that they are less successful in avoiding epiphenomenalism than they might seem; or at least they are no better off than [naturalistic dualism]. even on these views, there is a sense in which the phenomenal is irrelevant. we can always subtract the phenomenal component from any explanatory account, yielding a purely causal component.
the interpretation has also been criticized for not explaining which things have sufficient consciousness to collapse the wave function. also, it posits an important role for the conscious mind, and it has been questioned how this could be the case for the earlier universe, before consciousness had evolved or emerged.  it has been argued that ""[consciousness causes collapse] does not allow sensible discussion of big bang cosmology or biological evolution"". for example, roger penrose remarked: ""[t]he evolution of conscious life on this planet is due to appropriate mutations having taken place at various times.  these, presumably, are quantum events, so they would exist only in linearly superposed form until they finally led to the evolution of a conscious being—whose very existence depends on all the right mutations having 'actually' taken place!""  others further suppose a universal mind (see also panpsychism and panexperientialism).  other researchers have expressed similar objections to the introduction of any subjective element in the collapse of the wavefunction.


== testability ==
all interpretations of quantum mechanics are empirically indistinguishable, as they all predict the same outcomes to quantum mechanical experiments.  it has been argued that the results of delayed-choice quantum eraser experiments empirically falsify this interpretation.  however, the argument was shown to be invalid because an interference pattern would only be visible after post-measurement detections were correlated through use of a coincidence counter; if that wasn't true, the experiment would allow signaling into the past.  the delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment has also been used to argue for support of this interpretation, but, as with other arguments, none of the cited references proves or falsifies this interpretation.


== reception ==
a poll was conducted at a quantum mechanics conference in 2011 using 33 participants (including physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers). researchers found that 6% of participants (2 of the 33) indicated that they believed the observer ""plays a distinguished physical role (e.g., wave-function collapse by consciousness)"". this poll also states that 55% (18 of the 33) indicated that they believed the observer ""plays a fundamental role in the application of the formalism but plays no distinguished physical role"". they also mention that ""popular accounts have sometimes suggested that the copenhagen interpretation attributes such a role to consciousness. in our view, this is to misunderstand the copenhagen interpretation.""


=== views of the pioneers of quantum mechanics ===
many of the originators of quantum mechanical theory held that humans can effectively interrogate nature through interacting with it, and that in this regard quantum mechanics is not different from classical mechanics.  in addition, werner heisenberg maintained that wave function collapse, ""the discontinuous change in the probability function"", takes place when the result of a measurement is registered in the mind of an observer. however, this is because he understood the probability function as an artifact of human knowledge: he also argued that the reality of the material transition from ""possible"" to ""actual"" was mind-independent.  albert einstein, who believed in realism, and did not accept the theoretical completeness of quantum mechanics, similarly appealed for the merely epistemic conception of the wave function:

[i advocate] that one conceives of the psi-function [i.e., wavefunction] only as an incomplete description of a real state of affairs, where the incompleteness of the description is forced by the fact that observation of the state is only able to grasp part of the real factual situation. then one can at least escape the singular conception that observation (conceived as an act of consciousness) influences the real physical state of things; the change in the psi-function through observation then does not correspond essentially to the change in a real matter of fact but rather to the alteration in our knowledge of this matter of fact.
heisenberg and bohr described quantum mechanics in logical positivist terms. bohr also took an active interest in the philosophical implications of quantum theories such as his complementarity, for example. he believed quantum theory offers a complete description of nature, albeit one that is simply ill-suited for everyday experiences - which are better described by classical mechanics and probability. bohr never specified a demarcation line above which objects cease to be quantum and become classical. he believed that it was not a question of physics, but one of philosophy or convenience.

sampling error,non_science,"in statistics, sampling errors are incurred when the statistical characteristics of a population are estimated from a subset, or sample, of that population. since the sample does not include all members of the population, statistics of the sample (often known as estimators), such as means and quartiles, generally differ from the statistics of the entire population (known as parameters). the difference between the sample statistic and population parameter is considered the sampling error. for example, if one measures the height of a thousand individuals from a population of one million, the average height of the thousand is typically not the same as the average height of all one million people in the country.
since sampling is almost always done to estimate population parameters that are unknown, by definition exact measurement of the sampling errors will not be possible; however they can often be estimated, either by general methods such as bootstrapping, or by specific methods incorporating some assumptions (or guesses) regarding the true population distribution and parameters thereof.


== description ==


=== sampling error ===
the sampling error is the error caused by observing a sample instead of the whole population. the sampling error is the difference between a sample statistic used to estimate a population parameter and the actual but unknown value of the parameter.


=== effective sampling ===
in statistics, a truly random sample means selecting individuals from a population with an equivalent probability; in other words, picking individuals from a group without bias. failing to do this correctly will result in a sampling bias, which can dramatically increase the sample error in a systematic way. for example, attempting to measure the average height of the entire human population of the earth, but measuring a sample only from one country, could result in a large over- or under-estimation. in reality, obtaining an unbiased sample can be difficult as many parameters (in this example, country, age, gender, and so on) may strongly bias the estimator and it must be ensured that none of these factors play a part in the selection process.
even in a perfectly non-biased sample, the sample error will still exist due to the remaining statistical component; consider that measuring only two or three individuals and taking the average would produce a wildly varying result each time. the likely size of the sampling error can generally be reduced by taking a larger sample.


=== sample size determination ===
the cost of increasing a sample size may be prohibitive in reality. since the sample error can often be estimated beforehand as a function of the sample size, various methods of sample size determination are used to weigh the predicted accuracy of an estimator against the predicted cost of taking a larger sample.


=== bootstrapping and standard error ===

as discussed, a sample statistic, such as an average or percentage, will generally be subject to sample-to-sample variation. by comparing many samples, or splitting a larger sample up into smaller ones (potentially with overlap), the spread of the resulting sample statistics can be used to estimate the standard error on the sample.


== in genetics ==
the term ""sampling error"" has also been used in a related but fundamentally different sense in the field of genetics; for example in the bottleneck effect or founder effect, when natural disasters or migrations dramatically reduce the size of a population, resulting in a smaller population that may or may not fairly represent the original one. this is a source of genetic drift, as certain alleles become more or less common), and has been referred to as ""sampling error"", despite not being an ""error"" in the statistical sense.

rutacridone,reagent,"alkaloids are a class of basic, naturally occurring organic compounds  that contain at least one nitrogen atom. this group also includes some related compounds with neutral and even weakly acidic properties. some synthetic compounds of similar structure may also be termed alkaloids. in addition to carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen, alkaloids may also contain oxygen, sulfur and, more rarely, other elements such as chlorine, bromine, and phosphorus.alkaloids are produced by a large variety of organisms including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. they can be purified from crude extracts of these organisms by acid-base extraction, or solvent extractions followed by silica-gel column chromatography.  alkaloids have a wide range of pharmacological activities including antimalarial (e.g. quinine), antiasthma (e.g. ephedrine), anticancer (e.g. homoharringtonine), cholinomimetic (e.g. galantamine), vasodilatory (e.g. vincamine), antiarrhythmic (e.g. quinidine), analgesic (e.g. morphine), antibacterial (e.g. chelerythrine), and antihyperglycemic activities (e.g. piperine).  many have found use in traditional or modern medicine, or as starting points for drug discovery.  other alkaloids possess psychotropic (e.g. psilocin) and stimulant activities (e.g. cocaine, caffeine, nicotine, theobromine), and have been used in entheogenic rituals or as recreational drugs. alkaloids can be toxic too (e.g. atropine, tubocurarine).  although alkaloids act on a diversity of metabolic systems in humans and other animals, they almost uniformly evoke a bitter taste.the boundary between alkaloids and other nitrogen-containing natural compounds is not clear-cut. compounds like amino acid peptides, proteins, nucleotides, nucleic acid, amines, and antibiotics are usually not called alkaloids. natural compounds containing nitrogen in the exocyclic position (mescaline, serotonin, dopamine, etc.) are usually classified as amines rather than as alkaloids. some authors, however, consider alkaloids a special case of amines.


== naming ==

the name ""alkaloids"" (german: alkaloide) was introduced in 1819 by the german chemist carl friedrich wilhelm meißner, and is derived from late latin root alkali (which, in turn, comes from the arabic al-qalwī meaning 'ashes of plants') and the suffix -οειδής -('like'). however, the term came into wide use only after the publication of a review article, by oscar jacobsen in the chemical dictionary of albert ladenburg in the 1880s.there is no unique method for naming alkaloids. many individual names are formed by adding the suffix ""ine"" to the species or genus name. for example, atropine is isolated from the plant atropa belladonna; strychnine is obtained from the seed of the strychnine tree  (strychnos nux-vomica l.). where several alkaloids are extracted from one plant their names are often distinguished by variations in the  suffix: ""idine"", ""anine"", ""aline"", ""inine"" etc. there are also at least 86 alkaloids whose names contain the root ""vin"" because they are extracted from vinca plants such as vinca rosea (catharanthus roseus); these are called vinca alkaloids.


== history ==

alkaloid-containing plants have been used by humans since ancient times for therapeutic and recreational purposes. for example, medicinal plants have been known in mesopotamia from about 2000 bc. the odyssey of homer referred to a gift given to helen by the egyptian queen, a drug bringing oblivion. it is believed that the gift was an opium-containing drug. a chinese book on houseplants written in 1st–3rd centuries bc mentioned a medical use of ephedra and opium poppies. also, coca leaves have been used by south american indians since ancient times.extracts from plants containing toxic alkaloids, such as aconitine and tubocurarine, were used since antiquity for poisoning arrows.studies of alkaloids began in the 19th century. in 1804, the german chemist friedrich sertürner isolated from opium a ""soporific principle"" (latin: principium somniferum), which he called ""morphium"", referring to morpheus, the greek god of dreams; in german and some other central-european languages, this is still the name of the drug. the term ""morphine"", used in english and french, was given by the french physicist joseph louis gay-lussac.
a significant contribution to the chemistry of alkaloids in the early years of its development was made by the french researchers pierre joseph pelletier and joseph bienaimé caventou, who discovered quinine (1820) and strychnine (1818). several other alkaloids were discovered around that time, including xanthine (1817), atropine (1819), caffeine (1820), coniine (1827), nicotine (1828), colchicine (1833), sparteine (1851), and cocaine (1860).  the development of the chemistry of alkaloids was accelerated by the emergence of spectroscopic and chromatographic methods in the 20th century, so that by 2008 more than 12,000 alkaloids had been identified.the first complete synthesis of an alkaloid was achieved in 1886 by the german chemist albert ladenburg. he produced coniine by reacting 2-methylpyridine with acetaldehyde and reducing the resulting 2-propenyl pyridine with sodium.


== classifications ==

compared with most other classes of natural compounds, alkaloids are characterized by a great structural diversity.  there is no uniform classification. initially, when knowledge of chemical structures was lacking, botanical classification of the source plants was relied on.  this classification is now considered obsolete.more recent classifications are based on similarity of the carbon skeleton (e.g., indole-, isoquinoline-, and pyridine-like) or biochemical precursor (ornithine, lysine, tyrosine, tryptophan, etc.). however, they require compromises in borderline cases; for example, nicotine contains a pyridine fragment from nicotinamide and a pyrrolidine part from ornithine and therefore can be assigned to both classes.alkaloids are often divided into the following major groups:
""true alkaloids"" contain nitrogen in the heterocycle and originate from amino acids. their characteristic examples are atropine, nicotine, and morphine. this group also includes some alkaloids that besides the nitrogen heterocycle contain terpene (e.g., evonine) or peptide fragments (e.g. ergotamine). the piperidine alkaloids coniine and coniceine may be regarded as true alkaloids (rather than pseudoalkaloids: see below) although they do not originate from amino acids.
""protoalkaloids"", which contain nitrogen (but not the nitrogen heterocycle) and also originate from amino acids. examples include mescaline, adrenaline and ephedrine.
polyamine alkaloids – derivatives of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine.
peptide and cyclopeptide alkaloids.
pseudoalkaloids – alkaloid-like compounds that do not originate from amino acids. this group includes terpene-like and steroid-like alkaloids, as well as purine-like alkaloids such as caffeine, theobromine, theacrine and theophylline. some authors classify as pseudoalkaloids such compounds such as ephedrine and cathinone. those originate from the amino acid phenylalanine, but acquire their nitrogen atom not from the amino acid but through transamination.some alkaloids do not have the carbon skeleton characteristic of their group. so, galanthamine and homoaporphines do not contain isoquinoline fragment, but are, in general, attributed to isoquinoline alkaloids.main classes of monomeric alkaloids are listed in the table below:


== properties ==

most alkaloids contain oxygen in their molecular structure; those compounds are usually colorless crystals at ambient conditions. oxygen-free alkaloids, such as nicotine or coniine, are typically volatile, colorless, oily liquids. some alkaloids are colored, like berberine (yellow) and sanguinarine (orange).most alkaloids are weak bases, but some, such as theobromine and theophylline, are amphoteric. many alkaloids dissolve poorly in water but readily dissolve in organic solvents, such as diethyl ether, chloroform or 1,2-dichloroethane. caffeine, cocaine, codeine and nicotine are slightly soluble in water (with a solubility of ≥1g/l), whereas others, including morphine and yohimbine are very slightly water-soluble (0.1–1 g/l). alkaloids and acids form salts of various strengths. these salts are usually freely soluble in water and ethanol and poorly soluble in most organic solvents. exceptions include scopolamine hydrobromide, which is soluble in organic solvents, and the water-soluble quinine sulfate.most alkaloids have a bitter taste or are poisonous when ingested. alkaloid production in plants appeared to have evolved in response to feeding by herbivorous animals; however, some animals have evolved the ability to detoxify alkaloids.  some alkaloids can produce developmental defects in the offspring of animals that consume but cannot detoxify the alkaloids.  one example is the alkaloid cyclopamine, produced in the leaves of corn lily. during the 1950s, up to 25% of lambs born by sheep that had grazed on corn lily had serious facial deformations. these ranged from deformed jaws to cyclopia (see picture). after decades of research, in the 1980s, the compound responsible for these deformities was identified as the alkaloid 11-deoxyjervine, later renamed to cyclopamine.


== distribution in nature ==

alkaloids are generated by various living organisms, especially by higher plants – about 10 to 25% of those contain alkaloids. therefore, in the past the term ""alkaloid"" was associated with plants.the alkaloids content in plants is usually within a few percent and is inhomogeneous over the plant tissues. depending on the type of plants, the maximum concentration is observed in the leaves (black henbane), fruits or seeds (strychnine tree), root (rauvolfia serpentina) or bark (cinchona). furthermore, different tissues of the same plants may contain different alkaloids.beside plants, alkaloids are found in certain types of fungi, such as psilocybin in the fungus of the genus psilocybe, and in animals, such as bufotenin in the skin of some toads  and a number of insects, markedly ants. many marine organisms also contain alkaloids. some amines, such as adrenaline and serotonin, which play an important role in higher animals, are similar to alkaloids in their structure and biosynthesis and are sometimes called alkaloids.


== extraction ==

because of the structural diversity of alkaloids, there is no single method of their extraction from natural raw materials. most methods exploit the property of most alkaloids to be soluble in organic solvents  but not in water, and the opposite tendency of their salts.
most plants contain several alkaloids. their mixture is extracted first and then individual alkaloids are separated. plants are thoroughly ground before extraction. most alkaloids are present in the raw plants in the form of salts of organic acids. the extracted alkaloids may remain salts or change into bases. base extraction is achieved by processing the raw material with alkaline solutions and extracting the alkaloid bases with organic solvents, such as 1,2-dichloroethane, chloroform, diethyl ether or benzene. then, the impurities are dissolved by weak acids; this converts alkaloid bases into salts that are washed away with water. if necessary, an aqueous solution of alkaloid salts is again made alkaline and treated with an organic solvent. the process is repeated until the desired purity is achieved.
in the acidic extraction, the raw plant material is processed by a weak acidic solution (e.g., acetic acid in water, ethanol, or methanol). a base is then added to convert alkaloids to basic forms that are extracted with organic solvent (if the extraction was performed with alcohol, it is removed first, and the remainder is dissolved in water). the solution is purified as described above.alkaloids are separated from their mixture using their different solubility in certain solvents and different reactivity with certain reagents or by distillation.a number of alkaloids are identified from insects, among which the fire ant venom alkaloids known as solenopsins have received greater attention from researchers. these insect alkaloids can be efficiently extracted by solvent immersion of live fire ants  or by centrifugation of live ants  followed by silica-gel chromatography purification. tracking and dosing the extracted solenopsin ant alkaloids has been described as possible based on their absorbance peak around 232 nanometers.


== biosynthesis ==
biological precursors of most alkaloids are amino acids, such as ornithine, lysine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, histidine, aspartic acid, and anthranilic acid. nicotinic acid can be synthesized from tryptophan or aspartic acid. ways of alkaloid biosynthesis are too numerous and cannot be easily classified. however, there are a few typical reactions involved in the biosynthesis of various classes of alkaloids, including synthesis of schiff bases and mannich reaction.


=== synthesis of schiff bases ===

schiff bases can be obtained by reacting amines with ketones or aldehydes. these reactions are a common method of producing c=n bonds.

in the biosynthesis of alkaloids, such reactions may take place within a molecule, such as in the synthesis of piperidine:


=== mannich reaction ===

an integral component of the mannich reaction, in addition to an amine and a carbonyl compound, is a carbanion, which plays the role of the nucleophile in the nucleophilic addition to the ion formed by the reaction of the amine and the carbonyl.

the mannich reaction can proceed both intermolecularly and intramolecularly:


== dimer alkaloids ==
in addition to the described above monomeric alkaloids, there are also dimeric, and even trimeric and tetrameric alkaloids formed upon condensation of two, three, and four monomeric alkaloids. dimeric alkaloids are usually formed from monomers of the same type through the following mechanisms:
mannich reaction, resulting in, e.g., voacamine
michael reaction (villalstonine)
condensation of aldehydes with amines (toxiferine)
oxidative addition of phenols (dauricine, tubocurarine)
lactonization (carpaine).
		
		
		
		
		
there are also dimeric alkaloids formed from two distinct monomers, such as the vinca alkaloids vinblastine and vincristine, which are formed from the coupling of catharanthine and vindoline.    the newer semi-synthetic chemotherapeutic agent vinorelbine is used in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer.  it is another derivative dimer of vindoline and catharanthine and is synthesised from anhydrovinblastine, starting either from leurosine or the monomers themselves.


== biological role ==
the role of alkaloids for living organisms that produce them is still unclear. it was initially assumed that the alkaloids are the final products of nitrogen  metabolism  in plants, as urea in mammals. it was later shown that alkaloid concentration varies over time, and this hypothesis was refuted. a number of ants are suggested to also produce alkaloids as venom components, however the exact biosynthesis pathways have not been empirically demonstrated.most of the known functions of alkaloids are related to protection. for example, aporphine alkaloid liriodenine produced by the tulip tree protects it from parasitic mushrooms. in addition, the presence of alkaloids in the plant prevents insects and chordate animals from eating it. however, some animals are adapted to alkaloids and even use them in their own metabolism. such alkaloid-related substances as serotonin, dopamine and histamine are important neurotransmitters in animals. alkaloids are also known to regulate plant growth. one example of an organism that uses alkaloids for protection is the utetheisa ornatrix, more commonly known as the ornate moth. pyrrolizidine alkaloids render these larvae and adult moths unpalatable to many of their natural enemies like coccinelid beetles, green lacewings, insectivorous hemiptera and insectivorous bats. another example of alkaloids being utilized occurs in the poison hemlock moth (agonopterix alstroemeriana). this moth feeds on its highly toxic and alkaloid-rich host plant poison hemlock (conium maculatum) during its larval stage. a. asltroemeriana may benefit twofold from the toxicity of the naturally-occurring alkaloids, both through the unpalatability of the species to predators and through the ability of a. alstroemeriana to recognize conium maculatum as the correct location for oviposition. a fire ant venom alkaloid known as solenopsin has been demonstrated to protect queens of invasive fire ants during the foundation of new nests, thus playing a central role in the spread of this pest ant species around the world.


== applications ==


=== in medicine ===
medical use of alkaloid-containing plants has a long history, and, thus, when the first alkaloids were isolated in the 19th century, they immediately found application in clinical practice. many alkaloids are still used in medicine, usually in the form of salts widely used including the following:
many synthetic and semisynthetic drugs are structural modifications of the alkaloids, which were designed to enhance or change the primary effect of the drug and reduce unwanted side-effects. for example, naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist, is a derivative of thebaine that is present in opium.

		


=== in agriculture ===
prior to the development of a wide range of relatively low-toxic synthetic pesticides, some alkaloids, such as salts of nicotine and anabasine, were used as insecticides. their use was limited by their high toxicity to humans.


=== use as psychoactive drugs ===
preparations of plants containing alkaloids and their extracts, and later pure alkaloids, have long been used as psychoactive substances. cocaine, caffeine, and cathinone are stimulants of the central nervous system. mescaline and many indole alkaloids (such as psilocybin, dimethyltryptamine and ibogaine) have hallucinogenic effect. morphine and codeine are strong narcotic pain killers.there are alkaloids that do not have strong psychoactive effect themselves, but are precursors for semi-synthetic psychoactive drugs. for example, ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are used to produce methcathinone and methamphetamine. thebaine is used in the synthesis of many painkillers such as oxycodone.

a stationary camera looks diagonally across a racetrack toward the infield showing the horses as they pass. once the horses have passed the camera it is clear that the race has come to an end and there is a close finish between three horses. once the race is over police officers run onto the field. the camera also displays various members of the audience moving around.


== current status ==
often muddled with the 1896 derby, shot by robert paul, the 1895 film is now freely available to viewers in the uk in a digital restoration on the bfi player. new research has revealed that the acres and paul films, including this one, were shot far slower than the forty frames per second required by the kinetoscope. they were actually filmed at around sixteen frames per second, which would later be established as the standard speed in the silent era.

fluoroquinolone resistant pare,antibiotic,"streptococcus pneumoniae, or pneumococcus, is a gram-positive, spherical bacteria, alpha-hemolytic (under aerobic conditions) or beta-hemolytic (under anaerobic conditions), facultative anaerobic member of the genus streptococcus. they are usually found in pairs (diplococci) and  do not form spores and are non motile. as a significant human pathogenic bacterium s. pneumoniae was recognized as a major cause of pneumonia in the late 19th century, and is the subject of many humoral immunity studies.
streptococcus pneumoniae resides asymptomatically in healthy carriers typically colonizing the respiratory tract, sinuses, and nasal cavity. however, in susceptible individuals with weaker immune systems, such as the elderly and young children, the bacterium may become pathogenic and spread to other locations to cause disease. it spreads by  direct person-to-person contact via respiratory droplets and by auto inoculation in persons carrying the bacteria in their upper respiratory tracts. it can be a cause of neonatal infections.streptococcus pneumoniae is the main cause of community acquired pneumonia and meningitis in children and the elderly, and of sepsis in those infected with hiv. the organism also causes many types of pneumococcal infections other than pneumonia.  these invasive pneumococcal diseases include bronchitis, rhinitis, acute sinusitis, otitis media, conjunctivitis, meningitis, sepsis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, endocarditis, peritonitis, pericarditis, cellulitis, and brain abscess.streptococcus pneumoniae can be differentiated from the viridans streptococci, some of which are also alpha-hemolytic, using an optochin test, as s. pneumoniae is optochin-sensitive. s. pneumoniae can also be distinguished based on its sensitivity to lysis by bile, the so-called ""bile solubility test"". the encapsulated, gram-positive, coccoid bacteria have a distinctive morphology on gram stain, lancet-shaped diplococci. they have a polysaccharide capsule that acts as a virulence factor for the organism; more than 90 different serotypes are known, and these types differ in virulence, prevalence, and extent of drug resistance.


== history ==
in 1881, the organism, known later in 1886 as the pneumococcus for its role as a cause of pneumonia, was first isolated simultaneously and independently by the u.s. army physician george sternberg and the french chemist louis pasteur.the organism was termed diplococcus pneumoniae from 1920 because of its characteristic appearance in gram-stained sputum. it was renamed streptococcus pneumoniae in 1974 because it was very similar to streptococci.streptococcus pneumoniae played a central role in demonstrating that genetic material consists of dna.  in 1928, frederick griffith demonstrated transformation of life turning harmless pneumococcus into a lethal form by co-inoculating the live pneumococci into a mouse along with heat-killed virulent pneumococci.  in 1944, oswald avery, colin macleod, and maclyn mccarty demonstrated that the transforming factor in griffith's experiment was not protein, as was widely believed at the time, but dna. avery's work marked the birth of the molecular era of genetics.


== genetics ==
the genome of s. pneumoniae is a closed, circular dna structure that contains between 2.0 and 2.1 million base pairs depending on the strain. it has a core set of 1553 genes, plus 154 genes in its virulome, which contribute to virulence and 176 genes that maintain a noninvasive phenotype. genetic information can vary up to 10% between strains. the pneumococcal genome is known to contain a large and diverse repertoire of antimicrobial peptides, including 11 different lantibiotics.


=== transformation ===
natural bacterial transformation involves the transfer of dna from one bacterium to another through the surrounding medium. transformation is a complex developmental process requiring energy and is dependent on expression of numerous genes. in s. pneumoniae, at least 23 genes are required for transformation. for a bacterium to bind, take up, and recombine exogenous dna into its chromosome, it must enter a special physiological state called competence.
competence in s. pneumoniae is induced by dna-damaging agents such as mitomycin c, fluoroquinolone antibiotics (norfloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin), and topoisomerase inhibitors. transformation protects s. pneumoniae against the bactericidal effect of mitomycin c.  michod et al. summarized evidence that induction of competence in s. pneumoniae is associated with increased resistance to oxidative stress and increased expression of the reca protein, a key component of the recombinational repair machinery for removing dna damages. on the basis of these findings, they suggested that transformation is an adaptation for repairing oxidative dna damages. s. pneumoniae infection stimulates polymorphonuclear leukocytes (granulocytes) to produce an oxidative burst that is potentially lethal to the bacteria. the ability of s. pneumoniae to repair the oxidative dna damages in its genome, caused by this host defense, likely contributes to this pathogen's virulence. consistent with this premise, li et al. reported that, among different highly transformable s. pneumoniae isolates, nasal colonization fitness and virulence (lung infectivity) depend on an intact competence system.


== infection ==

streptococcus pneumoniae is part of the normal upper respiratory tract flora. as with many natural flora, it can become pathogenic under the right conditions, typically when the immune system of the host is suppressed. invasins, such as pneumolysin, an antiphagocytic capsule, various adhesins, and immunogenic cell wall components are all major virulence factors. after s. pneumoniae colonizes the air sacs of the lungs, the body responds by stimulating the inflammatory response, causing plasma, blood, and white blood cells to fill the alveoli. this condition is called pneumonia.


== diseases and symptoms ==
pneumonia is the most common of the s. pneumoniae diseases which include symptoms such as fever and chills, cough, rapid breathing, difficulty breathing, and chest pain. for the elderly, they may include confusion, low alertness, and the former listed symptoms to a lesser degree.
pneumococcal meningitis is an infection of the tissue covering the brain and spinal cord. symptoms include stiff neck, fever, headache, confusion, and photophobia.
sepsis is caused by overwhelming response to an infection and leads to tissue damage, organ failure, and even death. the symptoms include confusion, shortness of breath, elevated heart rate, pain or discomfort, over-perspiration, fever, shivering, or feeling cold.


== vaccine ==

due to the importance of disease caused by s. pneumoniae, several vaccines have been developed to protect against invasive infection. the world health organization recommends routine childhood pneumococcal vaccination; it is incorporated into the childhood immunization schedule in a number of countries including the united kingdom, the united states, and south africa.


== interaction with haemophilus influenzae ==
historically, haemophilus influenzae  has been a significant cause of infection, and both h. influenzae and s. pneumoniae can be found in the human upper respiratory system. a study of competition in vitro revealed  s. pneumoniae overpowered h. influenzae by attacking it with  hydrogen peroxide. however, in a study adding both bacteria to the nasal cavity of a mouse within 2 weeks, only h. influenzae survives; further analysis showed that neutrophils exposed to dead h. influenzae were more aggressive in attacking s. pneumoniae.


== diagnosis ==

diagnosis is generally made based on clinical suspicion along with a positive culture from a sample from virtually any place in the body. s. pneumoniae is, in general, optochin sensitive, although optochin resistance has been observed.the recent advances in next-generation sequencing  and comparative genomics have enabled the development of robust and reliable molecular methods for the detection and identification of s. pneumoniae. for instance, the xisco gene was recently described as a biomarker for pcr-based detection of s. pneumoniae and differentiation from closely related species.atromentin and leucomelone possess antibacterial activity, inhibiting the enzyme enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase, (essential for the biosynthesis of fatty acids) in s. pneumoniae.


== resistance ==

resistant pneumococcal strains are called penicillin-resistant pneumococci (prp), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp), streptococcus pneumoniae penicillin resistant (sppr) or drug-resistant strepotococcus pneumoniae (drsp). in 2015, in the us, there were an estimated 30,000 cases, and in 30% of them the strains were resistant to one or more antibiotics.

glutamine-dependent nad(+) synthetase isoform 1,protein,"the citric acid cycle (cac) – also known as the tca cycle (tricarboxylic acid cycle) or the krebs cycle – is a series of chemical reactions used by all aerobic organisms to release stored energy through the oxidation of acetyl-coa derived from carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. in addition, the cycle provides precursors of certain amino acids, as well as the reducing agent nadh, that are used in numerous other reactions. its central importance to many biochemical pathways suggests that it was one of the earliest components of metabolism and may have originated abiogenically. even though it is branded as a 'cycle', it is not necessary for metabolites to follow only one specific route; at least three segments of the citric acid cycle have been recognized.the name of this metabolic pathway is derived from the citric acid (a tricarboxylic acid, often called citrate, as the ionized form predominates at biological ph) that is consumed and then regenerated by this sequence of reactions to complete the cycle. the cycle consumes acetate (in the form of acetyl-coa) and water, reduces nad+ to nadh, releasing carbon dioxide. the nadh generated by the citric acid cycle is fed into the oxidative phosphorylation (electron transport) pathway. the net result of these two closely linked pathways is the oxidation of nutrients to produce usable chemical energy in the form of atp.
in eukaryotic cells, the citric acid cycle occurs in the matrix of the mitochondrion. in prokaryotic cells, such as bacteria, which lack mitochondria, the citric acid cycle reaction sequence is performed in the cytosol with the proton gradient for atp production being across the cell's surface (plasma membrane) rather than the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. the overall yield of energy-containing compounds from the tca cycle is three nadh, one fadh2, and one gtp.


== discovery ==
several of the components and reactions of the citric acid cycle were established in the 1930s by the research of albert szent-györgyi, who received the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1937 specifically for his discoveries pertaining to fumaric acid, a key component of the cycle. he made this discovery by studying pigeon breast muscle. because this tissue maintains its oxidative capacity well after breaking down in the ""latapie"" mill and releasing in aqueous solutions, breast muscle of the pigeon was very well qualified for the study of oxidative reactions. the citric acid cycle itself was finally identified in 1937 by hans adolf krebs and william arthur johnson while at the university of sheffield, for which the former received the nobel prize for physiology or medicine in 1953, and for whom the cycle is sometimes named (krebs cycle).


== overview ==

the citric acid cycle is a key metabolic pathway that connects carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism. the reactions of the cycle are carried out by eight enzymes that completely oxidize acetate (a two carbon molecule), in the form of acetyl-coa, into two molecules each of carbon dioxide and water. through catabolism of sugars, fats, and proteins, the two-carbon organic product acetyl-coa (a form of acetate) is produced which enters the citric acid cycle. the reactions of the cycle also convert three equivalents of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nad+) into three equivalents of reduced nad+ (nadh), one equivalent of flavin adenine dinucleotide (fad) into one equivalent of fadh2, and one equivalent each of guanosine diphosphate (gdp) and inorganic phosphate (pi) into one equivalent of guanosine triphosphate (gtp). the nadh and fadh2 generated by the citric acid cycle are, in turn, used by the oxidative phosphorylation pathway to generate energy-rich atp.
one of the primary sources of acetyl-coa is from the breakdown of sugars by glycolysis which yield pyruvate that in turn is decarboxylated by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex generating acetyl-coa according to the following reaction scheme:

ch3c(=o)c(=o)o−pyruvate + hscoa + nad+ → ch3c(=o)scoaacetyl-coa + nadh + co2the product of this reaction, acetyl-coa, is the starting point for the citric acid cycle. acetyl-coa may also be obtained from the oxidation of fatty acids. below is a schematic outline of the cycle:

the citric acid cycle begins with the transfer of a two-carbon acetyl group from acetyl-coa to the four-carbon acceptor compound (oxaloacetate) to form a six-carbon compound (citrate).
the citrate then goes through a series of chemical transformations, losing two carboxyl groups as co2. the carbons lost as co2 originate from what was oxaloacetate, not directly from acetyl-coa. the carbons donated by acetyl-coa become part of the oxaloacetate carbon backbone after the first turn of the citric acid cycle. loss of the acetyl-coa-donated carbons as co2 requires several turns of the citric acid cycle. however, because of the role of the citric acid cycle in anabolism, they might not be lost, since many citric acid cycle intermediates are also used as precursors for the biosynthesis of other molecules.
most of the electrons made available by the oxidative steps of the cycle are transferred to nad+, forming nadh. for each acetyl group that enters the citric acid cycle, three molecules of nadh are produced. the citric acid cycle includes a series of oxidation reduction reaction in mitochondria .
in addition, electrons from the succinate oxidation step are transferred first to the fad cofactor of succinate dehydrogenase, reducing it to fadh2, and eventually to ubiquinone (q) in the mitochondrial membrane, reducing it to ubiquinol (qh2) which is a substrate of the electron transfer chain at the level of complex iii.
for every nadh and fadh2 that are produced in the citric acid cycle, 2.5 and 1.5 atp molecules are generated in oxidative phosphorylation, respectively.
at the end of each cycle, the four-carbon oxaloacetate has been regenerated, and the cycle continues.


== steps ==
there are ten basic steps in the citric acid cycle, as outlined below. the cycle is continuously supplied with new carbon in the form of acetyl-coa, entering at step 0 in the table.
two carbon atoms are oxidized to co2, the energy from these reactions is transferred to other metabolic processes through gtp (or atp), and as electrons in nadh and qh2. the nadh generated in the citric acid cycle may later be oxidized (donate its electrons) to drive atp synthesis in a type of process called oxidative phosphorylation. fadh2 is covalently attached to succinate dehydrogenase, an enzyme which functions both in the cac and the mitochondrial electron transport chain in oxidative phosphorylation. fadh2, therefore, facilitates transfer of electrons to coenzyme q, which is the final electron acceptor of the reaction catalyzed by the succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex, also acting as an intermediate in the electron transport chain.mitochondria in animals, including humans, possess two succinyl-coa synthetases: one that produces gtp from gdp, and another that produces atp from adp. plants have the type that produces atp (adp-forming succinyl-coa synthetase). several of the enzymes in the cycle may be loosely associated in a multienzyme protein complex within the mitochondrial matrix.the gtp that is formed by gdp-forming succinyl-coa synthetase may be utilized by nucleoside-diphosphate kinase to form atp (the catalyzed reaction is gtp + adp → gdp + atp).


== products ==
products of the first turn of the cycle are one gtp (or atp), three nadh, one qh2 and two co2.
because two acetyl-coa molecules are produced from each glucose molecule, two cycles are required per glucose molecule. therefore, at the end of two cycles, the products are: two gtp, six nadh, two qh2, and four co2.

the above reactions are balanced if pi represents the h2po4− ion, adp and gdp the adp2− and gdp2− ions, respectively, and atp and gtp the atp3− and gtp3− ions, respectively.
the total number of atp molecules obtained after complete oxidation of one glucose in glycolysis, citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation is estimated to be between 30 and 38.


== efficiency ==
the theoretical maximum yield of atp through oxidation of one molecule of glucose in glycolysis, citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation is 38 (assuming 3 molar equivalents of atp per equivalent nadh and 2 atp per uqh2). in eukaryotes, two equivalents of nadh and four equivalents of atp are generated in glycolysis, which takes place in the cytoplasm. transport of two of these equivalents of nadh into the mitochondria consumes two equivalents of atp, thus reducing the net production of atp to 36. furthermore, inefficiencies in oxidative phosphorylation due to leakage of protons across the mitochondrial membrane and slippage of the atp synthase/proton pump commonly reduces the atp yield from nadh and uqh2 to less than the theoretical maximum yield. the observed yields are, therefore, closer to ~2.5 atp per nadh and ~1.5 atp per uqh2, further reducing the total net production of atp to approximately 30. an assessment of the total atp yield with newly revised proton-to-atp ratios provides an estimate of 29.85 atp per glucose molecule.


== variation ==
while the citric acid cycle is in general highly conserved, there is significant variability in the enzymes found in different taxa (note that the diagrams on this page are specific to the mammalian pathway variant).
some differences exist between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. the conversion of d-threo-isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate is catalyzed in eukaryotes by the nad+-dependent ec 1.1.1.41, while prokaryotes employ the nadp+-dependent ec 1.1.1.42. similarly, the conversion of (s)-malate to oxaloacetate is catalyzed in eukaryotes by the nad+-dependent ec 1.1.1.37, while most prokaryotes utilize a quinone-dependent enzyme, ec 1.1.5.4.a step with significant variability is the conversion of succinyl-coa to succinate. most organisms utilize ec 6.2.1.5, succinate–coa ligase (adp-forming) (despite its name, the enzyme operates in the pathway in the direction of atp formation). in mammals a gtp-forming enzyme, succinate–coa ligase (gdp-forming) (ec 6.2.1.4) also operates. the level of utilization of each isoform is tissue dependent. in some acetate-producing bacteria, such as acetobacter aceti, an entirely different enzyme catalyzes this conversion – ec 2.8.3.18, succinyl-coa:acetate coa-transferase. this specialized enzyme links the tca cycle with acetate metabolism in these organisms. some bacteria, such as helicobacter pylori, employ yet another enzyme for this conversion – succinyl-coa:acetoacetate coa-transferase (ec 2.8.3.5).some variability also exists at the previous step – the conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-coa. while most organisms utilize the ubiquitous nad+-dependent 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, some bacteria utilize a ferredoxin-dependent 2-oxoglutarate synthase (ec 1.2.7.3).
other organisms, including obligately autotrophic and methanotrophic bacteria and archaea, bypass succinyl-coa entirely, and convert 2-oxoglutarate to succinate via succinate semialdehyde, using ec 4.1.1.71, 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylase, and ec 1.2.1.79, succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase.in cancer, there are substantial metabolic derangements that occur to ensure the proliferation of tumor cells, and consequently metabolites can accumulate which serve to facilitate tumorigenesis, dubbed oncometabolites. among the best characterized oncometabolites is 2-hydroxyglutarate which is produced through a heterozygous gain-of-function mutation (specifically a neomorphic one) in isocitrate dehydrogenase (idh) (which under normal circumstances catalyzes the oxidation of isocitrate to oxalosuccinate, which then spontaneously decarboxylates to alpha-ketoglutarate, as discussed above; in this case an additional reduction step occurs after the formation of alpha-ketoglutarate via nadph to yield 2-hydroxyglutarate), and hence idh is considered an oncogene. under physiological conditions, 2-hydroxyglutarate is a minor product of several metabolic pathways as an error but readily converted to alpha-ketoglutarate via hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase enzymes (l2hgdh and d2hgdh) but does not have a known physiologic role in mammalian cells; of note, in cancer, 2-hydroxyglutarate is likely a terminal metabolite as isotope labelling experiments of colorectal cancer cell lines show that its conversion back to alpha-ketoglutarate is too low to measure. in cancer, 2-hydroxyglutarate serves as a competitive inhibitor for a number of enzymes that facilitate reactions via alpha-ketoglutarate in alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. this mutation results in several important changes to the metabolism of the cell. for one thing, because there is an extra nadph-catalyzed reduction, this can contribute to depletion of cellular stores of nadph and also reduce levels of alpha-ketoglutarate available to the cell. in particular, the depletion of nadph is problematic because nadph is highly compartmentalized and cannot freely diffuse between the organelles in the cell. it is produced largely via the pentose phosphate pathway in the cytoplasm. the depletion of nadph results in increased oxidative stress within the cell as it is a required cofactor in the production of gsh, and this oxidative stress can result in dna damage. there are also changes on the genetic and epigenetic level through the function of histone lysine demethylases (kdms) and ten-eleven translocation (tet) enzymes; ordinarily tets hydroxylate 5-methylcytosines to prime them for demethylation. however, in the absence of alpha-ketoglutarate this cannot be done and there is hence hypermethylation of the cell's dna, serving to promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (emt) and inhibit cellular differentiation. a similar phenomenon is observed for the jumonji c family of kdms which require a hydroxylation to perform demethylation at the epsilon-amino methyl group. additionally, the inability of prolyl hydroxylases to catalyze reactions results in stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha, which is necessary to promote degradation of the latter (as under conditions of low oxygen there will not be adequate substrate for hydroxylation). this results in a pseudohypoxic phenotype in the cancer cell that promotes angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming, cell growth, and migration.


== regulation ==
allosteric regulation by metabolites. the regulation of the citric acid cycle is largely determined by product inhibition and substrate availability. if the cycle were permitted to run unchecked, large amounts of metabolic energy could be wasted in overproduction of reduced coenzyme such as nadh and atp. the major eventual substrate of the cycle is adp which gets converted to atp. a reduced amount of adp causes accumulation of precursor nadh which in turn can inhibit a number of enzymes. nadh, a product of all dehydrogenases in the citric acid cycle with the exception of succinate dehydrogenase, inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and also citrate synthase. acetyl-coa inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase, while succinyl-coa inhibits alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase. when tested in vitro with tca enzymes, atp inhibits citrate synthase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase; however, atp levels do not change more than 10% in vivo between rest and vigorous exercise. there is no known allosteric mechanism that can account for large changes in reaction rate from an allosteric effector whose concentration changes less than 10%.citrate is used for feedback inhibition, as it inhibits phosphofructokinase, an enzyme involved in glycolysis that catalyses formation of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, a precursor of pyruvate. this prevents a constant high rate of flux when there is an accumulation of citrate and a decrease in substrate for the enzyme.
regulation by calcium. calcium is also used as a regulator in the citric acid cycle. calcium levels in the mitochondrial matrix can reach up to the tens of micromolar levels during cellular activation. it activates pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase which in turn activates the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. calcium also activates isocitrate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. this increases the reaction rate of many of the steps in the cycle, and therefore increases flux throughout the pathway.
transcriptional regulation. recent work has demonstrated an important link between intermediates of the citric acid cycle and the regulation of hypoxia-inducible factors (hif). hif plays a role in the regulation of oxygen homeostasis, and is a transcription factor that targets angiogenesis, vascular remodeling, glucose utilization, iron transport and apoptosis. hif is synthesized constitutively, and hydroxylation of at least one of two critical proline residues mediates their interaction with the von hippel lindau e3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which targets them for rapid degradation. this reaction is catalysed by prolyl 4-hydroxylases. fumarate and succinate have been identified as potent inhibitors of prolyl hydroxylases, thus leading to the stabilisation of hif.


== major metabolic pathways converging on the citric acid cycle ==
several catabolic pathways converge on the citric acid cycle. most of these reactions add intermediates to the citric acid cycle, and are therefore known as anaplerotic reactions, from the greek meaning to ""fill up"". these increase the amount of acetyl coa that the cycle is able to carry, increasing the mitochondrion's capability to carry out respiration if this is otherwise a limiting factor. processes that remove intermediates from the cycle are termed ""cataplerotic"" reactions.
in this section and in the next, the citric acid cycle intermediates are indicated in italics to distinguish them from other substrates and end-products.
pyruvate molecules produced by glycolysis are actively transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane, and into the matrix. here they can be oxidized and combined with coenzyme a to form co2, acetyl-coa, and nadh, as in the normal cycle.however, it is also possible for pyruvate to be carboxylated by pyruvate carboxylase to form oxaloacetate. this latter reaction ""fills up"" the amount of oxaloacetate in the citric acid cycle, and is therefore an anaplerotic reaction, increasing the cycle's capacity to metabolize acetyl-coa when the tissue's energy needs (e.g. in muscle) are suddenly increased by activity.in the citric acid cycle all the intermediates (e.g. citrate, iso-citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate, and oxaloacetate) are regenerated during each turn of the cycle. adding more of any of these intermediates to the mitochondrion therefore means that that additional amount is retained within the cycle, increasing all the other intermediates as one is converted into the other. hence the addition of any one of them to the cycle has an anaplerotic effect, and its removal has a cataplerotic effect. these anaplerotic and cataplerotic reactions will, during the course of the cycle, increase or decrease the amount of oxaloacetate available to combine with acetyl-coa to form citric acid. this in turn increases or decreases the rate of atp production by the mitochondrion, and thus the availability of atp to the cell.acetyl-coa, on the other hand, derived from pyruvate oxidation, or from the beta-oxidation of fatty acids, is the only fuel to enter the citric acid cycle. with each turn of the cycle one molecule of acetyl-coa is consumed for every molecule of oxaloacetate present in the mitochondrial matrix, and is never regenerated. it is the oxidation of the acetate portion of acetyl-coa that produces co2 and water, with the energy of o2 thus released captured in the form of atp. the three steps of beta-oxidation resemble the steps that occur in the production of oxaloacetate from succinate in the tca cycle. acyl-coa is oxidized to trans-enoyl-coa while fad is reduced to fadh2, which is similar to the oxidation of succinate to fumarate. following, trans-enoyl-coa is hydrated across the double bond to beta-hydroxyacyl-coa, just like fumarate is hydrated to malate. lastly, beta-hydroxyacyl-coa is oxidized to beta-ketoacyl-coa while nad+ is reduced to nadh, which follows the same process as the oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate.in the liver, the carboxylation of cytosolic pyruvate into intra-mitochondrial oxaloacetate is an early step in the gluconeogenic pathway which converts lactate and de-aminated alanine into glucose, under the influence of high levels of glucagon and/or epinephrine in the blood. here the addition of oxaloacetate to the mitochondrion does not have a net anaplerotic effect, as another citric acid cycle intermediate (malate) is immediately removed from the mitochondrion to be converted into cytosolic oxaloacetate, which is ultimately converted into glucose, in a process that is almost the reverse of glycolysis.in protein catabolism, proteins are broken down by proteases into their constituent amino acids. their carbon skeletons (i.e. the de-aminated amino acids) may either enter the citric acid cycle as intermediates (e.g. alpha-ketoglutarate derived from glutamate or glutamine), having an anaplerotic effect on the cycle, or, in the case of leucine, isoleucine, lysine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine, they are converted into acetyl-coa which can be burned to co2 and water, or used to form ketone bodies, which too can only be burned in tissues other than the liver where they are formed, or excreted via the urine or breath. these latter amino acids are therefore termed ""ketogenic"" amino acids, whereas those that enter the citric acid cycle as intermediates can only be cataplerotically removed by entering the gluconeogenic pathway via malate which is transported out of the mitochondrion to be converted into cytosolic oxaloacetate and ultimately into glucose. these are the so-called ""glucogenic"" amino acids. de-aminated alanine, cysteine, glycine, serine, and threonine are converted to pyruvate and can consequently either enter the citric acid cycle as oxaloacetate (an anaplerotic reaction) or as acetyl-coa to be disposed of as co2 and water.in fat catabolism, triglycerides are hydrolyzed to break them into fatty acids and glycerol. in the liver the glycerol can be converted into glucose via dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate by way of gluconeogenesis. in many tissues, especially heart and skeletal muscle tissue, fatty acids are broken down through a process known as beta oxidation, which results in the production of mitochondrial acetyl-coa, which can be used in the citric acid cycle. beta oxidation of fatty acids with an odd number of methylene bridges produces propionyl-coa, which is then converted into succinyl-coa and fed into the citric acid cycle as an anaplerotic intermediate.the total energy gained from the complete breakdown of one (six-carbon) molecule of glucose by glycolysis, the formation of 2 acetyl-coa molecules, their catabolism in the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation equals about 30 atp molecules, in eukaryotes. the number of atp molecules derived from the beta oxidation of a 6 carbon segment of a fatty acid chain, and the subsequent oxidation of the resulting 3 molecules of acetyl-coa is 40.

several of the citric acid cycle intermediates are used for the synthesis of important compounds, which will have significant cataplerotic effects on the cycle.acetyl-coa cannot be transported out of the mitochondrion. to obtain cytosolic acetyl-coa, citrate is removed from the citric acid cycle and carried across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the cytosol. there it is cleaved by atp citrate lyase into acetyl-coa and oxaloacetate. the oxaloacetate is returned to mitochondrion as malate (and then converted back into oxaloacetate to transfer more acetyl-coa out of the mitochondrion). the cytosolic acetyl-coa is used for fatty acid synthesis and the production of cholesterol. cholesterol can, in turn, be used to synthesize the steroid hormones, bile salts, and vitamin d.the carbon skeletons of many non-essential amino acids are made from citric acid cycle intermediates. to turn them into amino acids the alpha keto-acids formed from the citric acid cycle intermediates have to acquire their amino groups from glutamate in a transamination reaction, in which pyridoxal phosphate is a cofactor. in this reaction the glutamate is converted into alpha-ketoglutarate, which is a citric acid cycle intermediate. the intermediates that can provide the carbon skeletons for amino acid synthesis are oxaloacetate which forms aspartate and asparagine; and alpha-ketoglutarate which forms glutamine, proline, and arginine.of these amino acids, aspartate and glutamine are used, together with carbon and nitrogen atoms from other sources, to form the purines that are used as the bases in dna and rna, as well as in atp, amp, gtp, nad, fad and coa.the pyrimidines are partly assembled from aspartate (derived from oxaloacetate). the pyrimidines, thymine, cytosine and uracil, form the complementary bases to the purine bases in dna and rna, and are also components of ctp, ump, udp and utp.the majority of the carbon atoms in the porphyrins come from the citric acid cycle intermediate, succinyl-coa. these molecules are an important component of the hemoproteins, such as hemoglobin, myoglobin and various cytochromes.during gluconeogenesis mitochondrial oxaloacetate is reduced to malate which is then transported out of the mitochondrion, to be oxidized back to oxaloacetate in the cytosol. cytosolic oxaloacetate is then decarboxylated to phosphoenolpyruvate by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, which is the rate limiting step in the conversion of nearly all the gluconeogenic precursors (such as the glucogenic amino acids and lactate) into glucose by the liver and kidney.because the citric acid cycle is involved in both catabolic and anabolic processes, it is known as an amphibolic pathway.

== glucose feeds the tca cycle via circulating lactate ==
the metabolic role of lactate is well recognized as a fuel for tissues and tumors. in the classical cori cycle, muscles produce lactate which is then taken up by the liver for gluconeogenesis. new studies suggest that lactate can be used as a source of carbon for the tca cycle.


== evolution ==
it is believed that components of the citric acid cycle were derived from anaerobic bacteria, and that the tca cycle itself may have evolved more than once. theoretically, several alternatives to the tca cycle exist; however, the tca cycle appears to be the most efficient. if several tca alternatives had evolved independently, they all appear to have converged to the tca cycle.

lone (caste),non_science,"lone (kashmiri: लोन (devanagari), لون (nastaleeq)) is a kashmiri caste found in the indian administered union territory of jammu and kashmir and the pakistani administered province of azad kashmir. the caste belongs to the vaishya order, who were mainly agriculturalists and traders.
 only one kram the lon is generally assigned a vaisya origin.
the lone tribe is based mainly in northern kashmir, although in the past few centuries there has been gradual diffusion of the tribe throughout the valley of kashmir and other parts of india. some members of this caste are also found in the pakistani-administered kashmir, they are said to have migrated there in 1947 or in the 1990s when militancy was at its height in the valley. however, the place of origin of the tribe and the area where the tribe is said to be mostly concentrated in is the northern kupwara district of the kashmir valley.although the vast majority of the lone tribe speak kashmiri as their mother tongue, significant numbers speak shina, especially those who live in the gurez valley. the majority of the people of the lone tribe follow islam as their religion and are predominantly  sunni muslims.

hygromycin b,antibiotic,"hygromycin b is an antibiotic produced by the bacterium streptomyces hygroscopicus. it is an aminoglycoside that kills bacteria, fungi and higher eukaryotic cells by inhibiting protein synthesis.


== history ==
hygromycin b was originally developed in the 1950s for use with animals and is still added into swine and chicken feed as an anthelmintic or anti-worming agent (product name: hygromix). hygromycin b is produced by streptomyces hygroscopicus, a bacterium isolated in 1953 from a soil sample. resistance genes were discovered in the early 1980s.


== mechanism of action ==
hygromycin is active against both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. it acts by inhibiting polypeptide synthesis. it stabilizes the trna-ribosomal acceptor site, thereby inhibiting translation.


== use in research ==
in the laboratory it is used for the selection and maintenance of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells that contain the hygromycin resistance gene. the resistance gene is a kinase that inactivates hygromycin b through phosphorylation. since the discovery of hygromycin-resistance genes, hygromycin b has become a standard selection antibiotic in gene transfer experiments in many prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. based on impurity monitor method, four different kinds of impurities are discovered in commercial hygromycin b from different suppliers and toxicities of different impurities to the cell lines are described in the following external links.


=== use in plant research ===
hygromycin resistance gene is frequently used as a selectable marker in research on plants. in rice agrobacterium-mediated transformation system, hygromycin is used at about 30–75 mg l−1, with an average of 50 mg l−1. the use of hygromycin at 50 mg l−1 demonstrated highly toxic to non-transformed calli. thus, it can be efficiently used to select transformants.

vant,antibiotic,"the van 't hoff equation relates the change in the equilibrium constant, keq, of a chemical reaction to the change in temperature, t, given the standard enthalpy change, δh⊖, for the process. it was proposed by dutch chemist jacobus henricus van 't hoff in 1884 in his book études de dynamique chimique (studies in dynamic chemistry). this equation is sometimes also referred to as the vukančić-vuković equation.the van 't hoff equation has been widely utilized to explore the changes in state functions in a thermodynamic system. the van 't hoff plot, which is derived from this equation, is especially effective in estimating the change in enthalpy, or total energy, and entropy, or number of accessible microstates, of a chemical reaction.

=== under standard conditions ===
under standard conditions, the van 't hoff equation is

where ln denotes natural logarithm and r is the ideal gas constant. this equation is exact at any one temperature. in practice, the equation is often integrated between two temperatures under the assumption that the reaction enthalpy δh is constant. since in reality δh and the reaction entropy δs do vary with temperature for most processes, the integrated equation is only approximate.
a major use of the integrated equation is to estimate a new equilibrium constant at a new absolute temperature assuming a constant standard enthalpy change over the temperature range.
to obtain the integrated equation, it is convenient to first rewrite the van 't hoff equation as

  differentiation of this expression with respect to the variable t yields the van 't hoff equation.
provided that δh⊖ and δs⊖ are constant, the preceding equation gives ln k as a linear function of 1/t and hence is known as the linear form of the van 't hoff equation. therefore, when the range in temperature is small enough that the standard reaction enthalpy and reaction entropy are essentially constant, a plot of the natural logarithm of the equilibrium constant versus the reciprocal temperature gives a straight line. the slope of the line may be multiplied by the gas constant r to obtain the standard enthalpy change of the reaction, and the intercept may be multiplied by r to obtain the standard entropy change.

the gibbs free energy changes with the temperature and pressure of the thermodynamic system. the van 't hoff isotherm can be used to determine the gibbs free energy for non-standard state reactions at a constant temperature:

  
    
      
        
          
            (

  where δrg is the gibbs free energy for the reaction, and qr is the reaction quotient. when a reaction is at equilibrium, qr = keq. the van 't hoff isotherm can help estimate the equilibrium reaction shift. when δrg < 0, the reaction moves in the forward direction. when δrg > 0, the reaction moves in the backwards directions. see chemical equilibrium.


== van 't hoff plot ==
for a reversible reaction, the equilibrium constant can be measured at a variety of temperatures. this data can be plotted on a graph with ln keq on the y-axis and 1/t on the x axis. the data should have a linear relationship, the equation for which can be found by fitting the data using the linear form of the van 't hoff equation

by measuring the equilibrium constant, keq, at different temperatures, the van 't hoff plot can be used to assess a reaction when temperature changes. knowing the slope and intercept from the van 't hoff plot, the enthalpy and entropy of a reaction can be easily obtained using

  the van 't hoff plot can be used to quickly determine the enthalpy of a chemical reaction both qualitatively and quantitatively. change in enthalpy can be positive or negative, leading to two major forms of the van 't hoff plot.


=== endothermic reactions ===

for an endothermic reaction, heat is absorbed, making the net enthalpy change positive. thus, according to the definition of the slope:

  for an endothermic reaction, δh > 0 (and the gas constant r > 0), so

    {\displaystyle {\text{slope}}=-{\frac {\delta h}{r}}<0.}
  thus, for an endothermic reaction, the van 't hoff plot should always have a negative slope.


=== exothermic reactions ===

for an exothermic reaction, heat is released, making the net enthalpy change negative. thus, according to the definition of the slope:

  
    
      
        
          slope
        
        =
        −
        
          
            
              δ
              h

        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{slope}}=-{\frac {\delta h}{r}},}
  from an exothermic reaction, δh < 0, so

  
    
      
        
          slope
        
        =
        −

            r
          
        
        >
        0.
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\text{slope}}=-{\frac {\delta h}{r}}>0.}
  thus, for an exothermic reaction, the van 't hoff plot should always have a positive slope.

    {\displaystyle \delta h^{\ominus }\approx 76\left(\ln k_{1}-\ln k_{2}\right){\text{ kj/mol}}.}
  now, error propagation shows that the error on δh⊖ will be about 76 kj/mol times the error on (ln k1 − ln k2), or about 110 kj/mol times the error on the ln k values.  assume for example that the error on each ln k is σ ≈ 0.05, a small but reasonable value. the error on δh⊖ will be about 5 kj/mol. so, even though the individual stability constants were determined with good precision, the enthalpy calculated in this way is subject to a significant error.
the entropy will then be obtained from δs⊖ = 1/t(δh⊖ + rt ln k). in this expression the error on the second term is negligible compared to the error on the first term. the magnifying factor is then 76 kj/mol ÷ 298 k, so for an error of 0.05 in the logarithms the error on δs⊖ will be of the order of 17 j/(k mol).
when equilibrium constants are measured at three or more temperatures, values of δh⊖ will be obtained by straight-line fitting. in this case the error on the standard enthalpy will be magnified to a somewhat lesser, but still substantial, extent.


== applications of the van 't hoff plot ==


=== van 't hoff analysis ===

in biological research, the van 't hoff plot is also called van 't hoff analysis. it is most effective in determining the favored product in a reaction.
assume two products b and c form in a reaction:

a a + d d → b b,
a a + d d → c c.in this case, keq can be defined as ratio of b to c rather than the equilibrium constant.
when b/c > 1, b is the favored product, and the data on the van 't hoff plot will be in the positive region.
when b/c < 1, c is the favored product, and the data on the van 't hoff plot will be in the negative region.
using this information, a van 't hoff analysis can help determine the most suitable temperature for a favored product.
in 2010, a van 't hoff analysis was used to determine whether water preferentially forms a hydrogen bond with the c-terminus or the n-terminus of the amino acid proline. the equilibrium constant for each reaction was found at a variety of temperatures, and a van 't hoff plot was created. this analysis showed that enthalpically, the water preferred to hydrogen bond to the c-terminus, but entropically it was more favorable to hydrogen bond with the n-terminus. specifically, they found that c-terminus hydrogen bonding was favored by 4.2–6.4 kj/mol. the n-terminus hydrogen bonding was favored by 31–43 j/(k mol).
this data alone could not conclude which site water will preferentially hydrogen-bond to, so additional experiments were used. it was determined that at lower temperatures, the enthalpically favored species, the water hydrogen-bonded to the c-terminus, was preferred. at higher temperatures, the entropically favored species, the water hydrogen-bonded to the n-terminus, was preferred.


=== mechanistic studies ===

a chemical reaction may undergo different reaction mechanisms at different temperatures.in this case, a van 't hoff plot with two or more linear fits may be exploited. each linear fit has a different slope and intercept, which indicates different changes in enthalpy and entropy for each distinct mechanisms. the van 't hoff plot can be used to find the enthalpy and entropy change for each mechanism and the favored mechanism under different temperatures.

  in the example figure, the reaction undergoes mechanism 1 at high temperature and mechanism 2 at low temperature.


=== temperature dependence ===

the van 't hoff plot is linear based on the tacit assumption that the enthalpy and entropy are constant with temperature changes. however, in some cases the enthalpy and entropy do change dramatically with temperature. a first-order approximation is to assume that the two different reaction products have different heat capacities. incorporating this assumption yields an additional term c/t2 in the expression for the equilibrium constant as a function of temperature. a polynomial fit can then be used to analyze data that exhibits a non-constant standard enthalpy of reaction:

  thus, the enthalpy and entropy of a reaction can still be determined at specific temperatures even when a temperature dependence exists.

dugong hunting in australia,non_science,"dugong hunting in australia is not prohibited; however, the practise is heavily regulated.  dugongs are protected throughout australia, although the rules vary by state; in some areas indigenous hunting is allowed. dugongs are listed under the nature conservation act in the australian state of queensland as vulnerable. most currently live in established marine parks, where boats must travel at a restricted speed and mesh net fishing is restricted.dugong hunting has been practised in wide bay–burnett in queensland since at least 1861.  commercial netting began in 1924.  the dugong was a prized source of oil, hide, and meat, and charcoal from their bones was used in sugar refining. the practice was banned in 1965, apart from a limited catch by indigenous australians, who used dugongs as a food source since before the arrival of european settlers. the native title act 1993 allows for traditional owners to hunt both turtles and dugongs.


== history ==

hunting of dugongs for their flesh and oil which was exported to europe for medicinal purposes began in the 1850s. apart from the traditional aboriginal hunters, it is difficult to place precisely when dugong hunting commenced in the waters of the wide bay. one of the first references we have of this activity was recorded in the maryborough chronicle in august 1861 when a report claimed that a man named thomas gees, who was employed in 'dugong fishing' in hervey bay.john lionel ching during the 1870s and 1880s, was the person who primarily controlled the dugong industry in wide bay and hervey's bay. ching's method of catching the mammals was to string a long net across the mouths of estuaries and creeks where the dugongs were grazing on sea grasses. the dugong could then be driven into the nets where they would become entangled and finally drown; he would sell the flesh and oil to a ready market in maryborough and elsewhere. his production plant was based at stewart island, opposite boonooroo. john even perfected an ointment which he advertised in his pamphlets as being capable of curing rheumatism, bruises, sprains and other ills the flesh has. this oil was used during the first world war to relieve the suffering of soldiers who had been gassed in the trenches.  however, ching was so successful in hunting dugongs that after several years few of the mammals could be found in the region and he was forced to travel north where he soon set up another dugong processing plant.
during the 1870s, other dugong fishermen set up a small operation at hervey bay, building a crude hut where they carried out the boiling down of the mammals. their work was only modestly successful and they later gave up the venture.
commercial netting began in 1924 where the dugongs were netted, brought to the surface and then shot. prior to the banning of the trade in 1965, dugong oil was a popular australian product. brisbane chemists bought it in large quantities and it was also used in the production of cosmetics. dugong bone, when turned into charcoal, was said to be the best charcoal for sugar refining.
a ban on hunting dugongs in moreton bay was enacted on 20 march 1969.


== current practice ==
aboriginal people are still allowed to hunt a small number of sea cows, and this practice has been partially responsible for the decline in dugong numbers during the past 30 years. other factors, such as human clearance of seagrass, the dugong's main food source; and metal pollution, have also contributed to the decline. however, the current dugong population of australia is comparatively healthy, and is under limited threat except in eastern queensland.

edith hamilton,non_science,"edith hamilton (august 12, 1867 – may 31, 1963) was an american educator and internationally known author who was one of the most renowned classicists of her era in the united states. a graduate of bryn mawr college, she also studied in germany at the university of leipzig and the university of munich. hamilton began her career as an educator and head of the bryn mawr school, a private college preparatory school for girls in baltimore, maryland; however, hamilton is best known for her essays and best-selling books on ancient greek and roman civilizations.
hamilton's second career as an author began after her retirement from the bryn mawr school in 1922. she was sixty-two years old when her first book, the greek way, was published in 1930. it was an immediate success and a featured selection by the book-of-the-month club in 1957. hamilton's other notable works include the roman way (1932), the prophets of israel (1936), mythology (1942), and the echo of greece (1957).
critics have acclaimed hamilton's books for their lively interpretations of ancient cultures, and she is described as the classical scholar who ""brought into clear and brilliant focus the golden age of greek life and thought ... with homeric power and simplicity in her style of writing"". her works are said to influence modern lives through a ""realization of the refuge and strength in the past"" to those ""in the troubled present."" hamilton's younger sister was alice hamilton, an expert in industrial toxicology and the first woman appointed to the faculty of harvard university.


== early life and education ==


=== childhood and family ===

edith hamilton, the eldest child of american parents gertrude pond (1840–1917) and montgomery hamilton (1843–1909), was born on august 12, 1867, in dresden, germany. shortly after her birth, the hamilton family returned to the united states and made their home in fort wayne, indiana, where edith's grandfather, allen hamilton, had settled in the early 1820s. edith spent her youth among her extended family in fort wayne.edith's grandfather, allen hamilton, was an irish immigrant who came to indiana in 1823 by way of canada and settled in fort wayne. in 1828 he married emerine holman, the daughter of indiana supreme court justice jesse lynch holman. allen hamilton became a successful fort wayne businessman and a land speculator. much of the city of fort wayne was built on land he once owned. the hamilton family's large estate on a three-block area of downtown fort wayne included three homes. the family also built a home at mackinac island, michigan, where they spent many of their summers. for the most part, the second and third generations of the extended hamilton family, which included edith's family, as well as her uncles, aunts, and cousins, lived on inherited wealth.montgomery hamilton, a scholarly man of leisure, was one of allen and emerine (holman) hamilton's eleven children; however, only five of the siblings lived. her father attended princeton university and harvard law school and also studied in germany. montgomery met gertrude pond, the daughter of a wealthy wall street broker and sugar importer, while living in germany. they were married in 1866. montgomery hamilton became a partner in a wholesale grocery business in fort wayne, but the partnership dissolved in 1885 and the business failure caused a financial loss for the family. afterwards, montgomery hamilton retreated from public life. edith's mother, gertrude, who loved modern literature and spoke several languages, remained socially active in the community and had ""wide cultural and intellectual interests."" after the failure of her father's business, edith realized that she would need to provide a livelihood for herself and decided to become an educator.edith was the oldest of five siblings that included three sisters (alice (1869–1970), margaret (1871–1969), and norah (1873–1945)) and a brother (arthur ""quint"" (1886–1967)), all of whom were accomplished in their respective fields. edith became an educator and renowned author;  alice became a founder of industrial medicine; margaret, like her older sister, edith, became an educator and headmistress at bryn mawr school; and norah was an artist. hamilton's youngest sibling, arthur, was nineteen years her junior. he became a writer, professor of spanish, and assistant dean for foreign students at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign. arthur was the only sibling to marry; he and his wife, mary neal (d. 1965), had no children.


=== education ===
because edith's parents disliked the public school system's curriculum, they taught their children at home. as she once described him, ""my father was well-to-do, but he wasn't interested in making money; he was interested in making people use their minds."" edith, who learned to read at an early age, became an excellent storyteller. hamilton credited her father for guiding her towards studies of the classics; he began teaching her latin when she was seven years old. her father also introduced her to greek language and literature, where her mother taught the hamilton children french and had them tutored in german.in 1884 edith began two years of study at miss porter's finishing school for young ladies (now known as miss porter's school) in farmington, connecticut, where attendance was a family tradition for the hamilton women. three of hamilton's aunts, three cousins, and her three sisters attended the school.hamilton returned to indiana in 1886 and began four years of preparation prior to her acceptance at bryn mawr college near philadelphia, pennsylvania, in 1891. she majored in greek and latin and was awarded a bachelor of arts and a master of arts degree in 1894. hamilton spent the year after her graduation as a fellow in latin at bryn mawr college and was awarded the mary e. garrett european fellowship, the college's highest honor. the cash award from bryn mawr provided funds to enable edith and alice, who had completed her medical degree at the university of michigan in 1893,  to pursue further studies in germany for an academic year. hamilton became the first woman to enroll at the university of munich.


==== studies in germany ====
in the fall of 1895 the hamilton sisters departed for germany, where alice intended to continue her studies in pathology at the university of leipzig and edith planned to study the classics and attend lectures. at that time, most north american women, including edith and alice, registered as auditors for their classes. when the sisters arrived in leipzig, they found a fair number of foreign women studying at the university. they were informed that women could attend lectures, but they were expected to remain ""invisible"" and would not be allowed to participate in discussions.according to alice, ""edith was extremely disappointed with the lectures she attended."" although they were thorough, the lectures ""lost sight of the beauty of literature by focusing on obscure grammatical points."" as a result, they decided to enroll at the university of munich, but it was not much of an improvement. initially, it was uncertain whether edith would be allowed to audit lectures, but she was granted permission to do so, albeit under trying conditions. according to alice, when edith arrived at her first class, she was escorted to the lecture platform and seated in a chair beside the lecturer, facing the audience, ""so that nobody would be contaminated by contact with her."" edith is quoted as saying, ""the head of the university used to stare at me, then shake his head and say sadly to a colleague, 'there now, you see what's happened? we're right in the midst of the woman question.'""


== career ==


=== educator ===
hamilton intended to remain in munich, germany, to earn a doctoral degree, but her plans changed after martha carey thomas, president of bryn mawr college, persuaded hamilton to return to the united states. in 1896 hamilton became head administrator of bryn mawr school. founded in 1885 as a college preparatory school for girls in baltimore, maryland, bryn mawr school was the country's only private high school for women that prepared all of its students for collegiate coursework. the school's students were required to pass bryn mawr college's entrance exam as a requirement for graduation.although hamilton never completed her doctorate, she did become an ""inspiring and respected head of the school"" and was revered as an outstanding teacher of the classics, along with being an effective and successful administrator. she enhanced student life, maintained its high academic standards, and offered new ideas. hamilton was unafraid to suggest new initiatives such as having her school's basketball team compete against another girls' team from a nearby boarding school. the proposed athletic competition was considered a scandalous suggestion for the time because news coverage would include the names of the participants. after hamilton convinced the local press not to cover the event, the games proceeded and it became an annual tradition.in 1906, hamilton's accomplishments as an educator and administrator were recognized when she was named the first headmistress in the school's history. hamilton, who believed in providing students with a ""rigorous"" curriculum, successfully transitioned the girls school from its ""mediocre beginnings into one of the foremost preparatory institutions in the country."" her insistence on offering challenging standards to the students and different options on school policies led to confrontations with dean thomas. as hamilton became increasingly frustrated with the situation at the school, her health also declined. she retired in 1922 at the age of fifty-four, after twenty-six years of service to the school.


=== classicist and author ===
after retiring as an educator in 1922 and moving to new york city in 1924, hamilton began a second career as an author of essays and best-selling books on ancient greek and roman civilizations. she had studied greek and latin from her youth and it remained her lifelong interest. ""i came to the greeks early,"" hamilton told an interviewer when she was ninety-one, ""and i found answers in them. greece's great men let all their acts turn on the immortality of the soul. we don't really act as if we believed in the soul's immortality and that's why we are where we are today.""for more than fifty years her ""love affair with greece had smoldered without literary outlet"". at the suggestion of rosamund gilder, editor of theater arts monthly, hamilton began by writing essays about greek drama and comedies. several of her early articles were published in theater arts monthly before she began writing the series of books on ancient greek and roman life for which she is most noted. hamilton went on to become america's most renowned classicist of her era.according to her biographer, barbara sicherman, hamilton's life was ""ruled by a passionately nonconformist vision"" that was also the source of her ""strength and vitality"" as well as her ""appeal as public figure and author."" however, hamilton was not, and did not claim to be, a scholar. she did not attempt to present excessive detailed facts from the past. instead, hamilton focused on readability and uncovering ""truths of the spirit,"" which she found from ancient writers. drawing from greek, roman, hebrew, and early christian writings, hamilton put into words what ancient people were like by concentrating on what they wrote about their own lives. using the qualities and styles of the ancient writers, she emulated their directness, strived for perfection, and did not include footnotes.
the greek wayhamilton was sixty-two when her first book, the greek way, was published in 1930 and is considered by some as her most honored work, the successful book, which hamilton wrote at the urging of elling annestad, an editor at w. w. norton company, made her a well-known author in the united states. the bestseller drew comparisons between ancient greece and modern-day life with essays about some of the great figures of athenian history and literature. critically praised for its ""vivid and graceful prose,"" the book brought hamilton immediate acclaim and established her reputation as a scholar. biographer robert kanigel states that ""the greek way renders the ancient greek mind accessible to the modern reader. it serves up a delectable appetizer of greek civilization that leaves you begging for the rest of the meal. it is a work of popularization of the highest order.""in hamilton's view, greek civilization at its peak represented a ""flowering of the mind"" that has yet to be equaled in the history of the world. the greek way showed that the greeks recognized and appreciated such things as love, athletic games, love of knowledge, fine arts, and intelligent conversation. in ""east and west,"" the first of the book's twelve chapters, hamilton described the differences between the west and the  eastern nations which preceded it. one book reviewer noted that the greeks, which hamilton considered the first westerners, challenged eastern ways that ""remained the same throughout the ages, forever remote from all that is modern."" hamilton further suggested that the modern spirit of the west was ""a greek discovery, and the place of the greeks is in the modern world.""more recent writers have used hamilton's observations in contrasting the civilizations and cultures of the east with that of the west. in comparing ancient egypt with greece, for instance, hamilton's writing describes the unique geography, climate, agriculture, and government. historian james golden cites from the greek way that ""egyptian society was preoccupied with death."" its pharaohs erected giant monuments to themselves to impress future generations and its priests advised the slaves to ""look forward to an afterlife."" golden used hamilton's research to contrast these differences with the greeks, especially the athenians. hamilton argued that individual ""perfection of mind and body"" dominated greek thought and as a result, the greeks ""excelled at philosophy and sports"" and that life ""in all its exuberant potential"" was the hallmark of greek civilization.
the roman waythe roman way (1932), her second book, provided similar contrasts between ancient rome and present-day life. it was also a book-of-the-month club selection in 1957. hamilton described life as it existed according to ancient roman poets such as plautus, virgil and juvenal, interpreted roman thought and manners, and compared them to people's lives in the twentieth century. she also suggested how roman ideas applied to the modern world.although her books were successful and popular among readers, she conceded ""that it was hopeless to persuade americans to be greeks"" and that ""life had become far too complex since the age of pericles to recapture the simple directness of greek life ... the calm lucidity of the greek mind, which convinced the great thinkers of athens of their mastery of truth and enlightenment.""
the prophets of israelher books later covered other areas of interest, especially from the bible. in 1936 hamilton wrote the prophets of israel (norton, 1936), which interpreted the beliefs of the ""spokesmen for god"" in the old testament. with no knowledge of the hebrew language, she relied on english language versions of the bible to similarly compare the achievements and personal lives of the prophets with those of twentieth-century readers. she concludes that the prophets were practical and their political views reflected their time, but their ideals were modern.hamilton also summarized the importance of that connection to people in modern times: ""love and grief and joy remain the same forever beautiful"" and ""poetic truth is always true"" as are truths of the spirit. ""the prophets understand them as no men have more, and in their pages we can find ourselves. our aspirations are there, our desires for humanity."" american historian bruce catton noted the prophets, whose ""religion was an affair of the workaday world,"" and their messages that hamilton described in her ""excellent book"" are still as relevant today. a subsequent edition of the book, spokesmen for god: the great teachers of the old testament (norton, 1949), supplied additional commentary on the first five books of the old testament. christian science historian robert peel described it as ""a work of sheer delight.""

mythologyjohn mason brown, american drama critic, praised hamilton's the greek way, placing it at the top among modern-day written about ancient greece,"" and mythology as ""incomparably superior to thomas bulfinch's work on the subject. hamilton's mythology (1942), recounts the stories of classical mythology and ancient fables. she used an approach to mythology that was entirely through the literature of the classics. (she had not traveled to greece until 1929 and was not an archaeologist.) the book received favorable reviews, was another a book-of-the-month club selection, and had sold more than four and a half million copies by 1957.
later worksin 1942, after moving to washington, d.c., hamilton continued to write. at the age of eighty-two she offered new perspectives on the new testament in witness to the truth: christ and his interpreters (1948) and produced a sequel to the greek way, titled the echo of greece (1957). the sequel to her first book discusses the political ideas of such teachers and leaders as socrates, plato, aristotle, demosthenes, and alexander the great.hamilton continued traveling and lecturing in her eighties, and wrote articles, reviews, and translations of greek plays, including the trojan women,, prometheus bound, and agamemnon. she also edited, with huntington cairns, the collected dialogues of plato (1961).


== companion doris reid ==
doris fielding reid (1895–1973) was an american stockbroker. she was the daughter of harry fielding reid, an american geophysicist, and edith gittings reid, biographer of doctor william osler and president woodrow wilson. she was a student of edith hamilton. reid was employed by loomis, sayles and company beginning in 1929. reid and hamilton became lifelong companions. they lived together in gramercy park, manhattan and sea wall, maine, during which time they raised and home-schooled reid's nephew, francis dorian fielding reid (1917–2008). after hamilton's death, reid published the book edith hamilton: an intimate portrait (1967). reid died on january 15, 1973, in manhattan. both women are buried at cove cemetery in hadlyme, connecticut.


== later years ==
hamilton and doris reid remained in new york city until 1943, then moved to washington, d.c., and spent their summers in maine. in washington, reid was in charge of the local offices of loomis, sayles and company, an investment firm that had been her employer since 1929; hamilton continued to write and frequently entertained friends, fellow writers, government representatives, and other dignitaries at her home. among the eminent and famous were isak dinesen, robert frost, harvard classicist werner jaeger and labor leader john l. lewis.after her move to washington, hamilton became a commentator on education projects and began to receive honors for her work. hamilton also recorded programs for television programs and voice of america, traveled to europe, and continued to write books, articles, essays, and book reviews.

hamilton considered the high point of her life to be a trip to greece at age 90 in 1957, where, in athens, she saw her translation of aeschylus's prometheus bound performed at the ancient odeon theater of herodes atticus. as part of the evening's ceremonies, king paul of greece awarded the golden cross of the order of benefaction—one of greece's highest honors—to her. the mayor of athens made her an honorary citizen of the city. the us news media, including time magazine, covered the event. an article in publishers weekly described the event in hamilton's honor: floodlights illuminated the parthenon, the temple of zeus and, for the first time in history, the stoa. hamilton called the ceremony ""the proudest moment of my life.""

many of the facts in the greek way (1930) have surprised modern readers. one reviewer in australia explained hamilton's view ""that the spirit of our age is a greek discovery, and that the greeks were really the first westerners, and the first intellectualists."" the same reviewer also credited the book with noting that modern concepts of play and sport were actually common activities to the greeks, who engaged in exercise and athletic events, including games, races, and music, dancing, and wrestling competitions, among others.among those whose lives were influenced by hamilton's writings was u.s. senator robert f. kennedy. in the months after his brother, president john f. kennedy, was assassinated, robert was consumed with grief. former first lady jacqueline kennedy gave him a copy of the greek way, which she felt was certain to help him. political commentator david brooks reported that hamilton's essays helped him better understand and then recover from his brother's tragic death. hamilton's writings remained important to him over time, as brooks explains, and changed kennedy's life. ""he carried his beaten, underlined and annotated copy around with him for years, reading sections aloud to audiences in a flat, unrhythmic voice with a mournful edge"" and could recite from memory various passages of aeschylus that hamilton had translated.according to reviewers, hamilton's the prophets of israel (1936) had similarities to her earlier books about greeks and romans by making the prophets' messages relevant to contemporary readers. she accomplishes this, according to one writer, by showing that ""behind all great thought stands an individual mind, fired by passion and possessed of an eye that sees deeply into humanity."" the views of the prophets, it adds, are very similar to those in modern times: ""the prophets were forerunners of three genuinely american movements—humanism, pragmatism and the philosophy of common sense.""


== death ==
hamilton died in washington, d.c. on may 31, 1963, at the age of nearly 96. four years after her death, doris fielding reid published edith hamilton: an intimate portrait. as of 2017 the memoir remains the only full-length biography of hamilton.
reid died on january 15, 1973. both women are buried at cove cemetery in hadlyme, connecticut, where hamilton's sisters had retired, in the same cemetery as hamilton's mother (gertrude), maternal aunts (alice, norah, and margaret), and margaret's life partner, clara landsberg. hamilton's adopted son, dorian, who had earned a degree in chemistry at amherst college, died at west lafayette, indiana, in january 2008, aged 90.


== legacy ==
hamilton was long recognized as a great classicist of her era. her best-selling books were especially noteworthy for their accessibility to a wide readership and for ""representing the greeks in particular as a prestigious source of cultural inspiration for american society during the decade before and the two decades after world war ii.""although hamilton's reputation as an author is closely tied to her writings about greece, much of her professional life focused on latin. hamilton ""claimed special expertise in greek,"" but after her graduation from bryn mawr college, where she majored in greek and latin, she spent another year at the college as a fellow in latin and another year studying latin in germany. hamilton also taught latin to girls in the senior class during her 26-year career at bryn mawr school in baltimore. however, with the exception of the roman way, hamilton's written works primarily focused on fourth and fifth century bc athens. hamilton's correspondence and papers are held at the schlesinger library at radcliffe college.


== honors and recognition ==
in 1906 hamilton became the first headmistress of the bryn mawr school in baltimore, maryland.in 1950 hamilton received an honorary degrees of doctor of letters from the university of rochester and the university of pennsylvania. she was also the recipient of an honorary degree from yale university in 1960. in addition, hamilton was elected to the american institute of arts and letters in 1955 and the american academy of arts and letters in 1957.hamilton received the national achievement award in 1951 as a distinguished classical scholar and author. she received the award along with anna m. rosenberg, assistant secretary of defense. the award was created in 1930 to honor women of accomplishment and inspire others.hamilton was awarded the golden cross of the order of benefaction, greece's highest honor, and became an honorary citizen of the city in 1957.in 1957 and 1958 she was interviewed by nbc television, and in 1957 the greek way and the roman way were selected by the book of the month club as summer readings. john f. kennedy invited her to his inauguration, which she declined. he also sent an emissary to her home asking for advice about a new cultural center.in 1958 the women's national book association awarded her for her contribution to american culture through books. george v. allen, director of the united states information agency (usia) and one of the speakers at the award ceremony, remarked that her interpretation of the democratic spirit of ancient greece, defined ""the fundamental of the democratic ideal itself."" he also noted that usia included seven of her books in its overseas libraries in order to help people of other countries interpret american ideals.she is the subject of a biography by doris fielding reid, edith hamilton: an intimate portrait.on april 4, 1968, while attending a campaign rally in indianapolis, indiana, on the eve of the assassination of martin luther king jr., u.s. senator robert f. kennedy quoted from hamilton's translated works ""in what is perhaps his most memorable speech."" kennedy quoted from memory several lines from hamilton's translation of aeschylus's tragedy, agamemnon, telling the grief-stricken crowd: ""in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of god.""  kennedy also incorporated another line from hamilton's writing, ""her representation of an ancient greek inscription"" in his closing remarks to the crowd: ""let us dedicate ourselves to what the greeks wrote so many years ago––to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world."" according to classicist joseph casazza, that line about ""taming the savageness of man"" was created by hamilton herself and has no direct relation to a single ancient text. based on his research, casazza believes that the phrase is a combination of a line from a 125 b.c. decree about athens by delphi and another line from on the character of thucydides by dionysius of halicarnassus.in 2000 the city of fort wayne, indiana, erected statues of two hamilton sisters, edith and alice, along with their cousin, agnes, in the city's headwaters park.

factor viii injection,drug,"factor viii is a medication used to treat and prevent bleeding in people with hemophilia a and other causes of low factor viii. certain preparations may also be used in those with von willebrand's disease. it is given by slow injection into a vein.side effects include skin flushing, shortness of breath, fever, and red blood cell breakdown. allergic reactions including anaphylaxis may occur. it is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe for the baby. a purified factor viii concentrate is made from human blood plasma. a recombinant version is also available. people may develop antibodies to factor viii such that this medication becomes less effective.factor viii was first identified in the 1940s and became available as a medication in the 1960s. recombinant factor viii was first made in 1984 and approved for medical use in the united states in 1992. it is on the world health organization's list of essential medicines.


== available forms ==
factor viii is delivered by intravenous infusion.


== history ==
this transfer of a plasma byproduct into the blood stream of a hemophiliac often led to the transmission of diseases such as hiv and hepatitis before purification methods were improved. in the early 1990s, pharmaceutical companies began to produce recombinant synthesized factor products, which now prevent nearly all forms of disease transmission during replacement therapy.


== society and culture ==


=== economics ===
the cost of factor viii and similar clotting factors has been described as ""highly expensive"".  the cost of the clotting factors is 80% of all medical costs for people with hemophilia.  they are so expensive that gene therapy for haemophilia might be less expensive, especially for people with severe hemophilia.

5'-gscscsgsasgsgstscscsastsgstscsgstsascsgsc-3',reagent,"the curtiss cs (or model 31) was a reconnaissance and torpedo bomber aircraft used by the united states navy during the 1920s. it was a large single-engine biplane with single-bay unstaggered wings, the design conventional in all respects other than that the lower wing was of greater span than the upper. the cs was built to allow its undercarriage to be quickly and easily interchangeable between wheeled, tailskid undercarriage, and twin pontoons for operation from water. provision for the carriage of a torpedo was semi-recessed into the underside of the fuselage, blended in behind an aerodynamic fairing. the pilot and gunner sat in tandem open cockpits, while accommodation inside the fuselage was provided for a third crewmember who served as bombardier and radio operator. this station was also provided with a dorsal hatch aft of the gunner's position, and a ventral blister aft of the torpedo recess, which was used for aiming bombs or torpedoes.


== development ==
curtiss produced six cs-1 prototypes for the navy in 1923, which were mostly used for engine tests. two examples of the improved cs-2 were built the following year and set a number of world speed, distance, and endurance records for seaplanes in its class. the navy ordered both the cs-1 and cs-2 into production, but when curtiss tendered with a price of $32,000 per aircraft, martin undercut them with a tender of $25,200 for each cs-1 and $19,863 for each cs-2 and won the contract. curtiss refused to provide full sets of drawings and data to martin, so martin-built machines were in part reverse-engineered from a curtiss-built cs-1 provided by the navy. by the time the martin-produced aircraft were delivered in 1925–26, the navy's designation system had changed, and they entered service as the sc-1 and sc-2. martin-built sc-2s suffered from poor handling characteristics and soon earned the nickname ""sea cow"". meanwhile, the naval aircraft factory made extensive modifications to the two curtiss cs-2s leading them to be redesignated cs-3. further development of the design was carried out by martin as the t3m and t4m, and eventually by great lakes as the tg.


== operational history ==
in 1924, the cs-2 was used to break numerous world records for seaplanes in its class in three long-range flights. the first of these took place overnight between 22 and 23 june, when lt frank wead and lt john d. price set five records – distance (963.123 mi, 1,544.753 km), duration (13 hours, 23 minutes, 15 seconds), speed over 500 km (73.41 mph, 117.74 km/h), speed over 1,000 km (74.27 mph, 119.12 km/h) and speed over 1,500 km (74.17 mph/118.96 km/h). between 11 and 12 july, the same pilots would break the distance and duration records again (994.19 mi/1,594.58 km over 14 hours, 53 minutes, 44 seconds). on october 10, these same two records would be exceeded by lt andrew crinkley and lt rossmore lyon in a flight of 1,460 mi (2,342 km) in 20 hours, 28 minutes. while these would have been new world records, the flight was not officially timed, and was therefore not recognized as such.
on september 23, 1925, the u.s. navy flew 23 curtiss cs-1 floatplanes to bay shore park on the chesapeake bay, 14 miles se of baltimore, maryland, on a friday with the intention of an air show demonstration before the 1925 schneider cup race on saturday, but that night gale-force winds broke three-inch mooring and anchor ropes on 17 of the biplanes and they were blown onto shore or dashed against seawalls, destroying seven and damaging ten. the next afternoon's baltimore evening sun had the headline ""plane disaster in harbor called hard blow to navy"" and quoted general william ""billy"" mitchell, who called the loss of the cs-1s ""staggering"" and blamed it on navy mismanagement of its aviation program.

(s)-lisofylline,reagent,"lisofylline (lsf) is a synthetic small molecule with novel anti-inflammatory properties. lsf can effectively prevent type 1 diabetes in preclinical models and improves the function and viability of isolated or transplanted pancreatic islets.  it is a metabolite of pentoxifylline.
as well, lsf improves cellular mitochondrial function and blocks interleukin-12 (il-12) signaling and stat-4 activation in target cells and tissues. il-12 and stat-4 activation are important pathways linked to inflammation and autoimmune damage to insulin producing cells. therefore, lsf and related analogs could provide a new therapeutic approach to prevent or reverse type 1 diabetes. lsf also directly reduces glucose-induced changes in human kidney cells suggesting that lsf and analogs have the potential to treat the complications associated with diabetes.

pyrenocyte,cell,"the genome of most cells of eukaryotes remains mainly constant during life. however, there are cases of genome being altered in specific cells or in different life cycle stages during development. for example, not every human cell has the same genetic content as red blood cells which are devoid of nucleus. one of the best known groups in respect of changes in somatic genome are ciliates. the process resulting in a variation of somatic genome that differs from germline genome is called somatic genome processing.


== genome loss ==
the result of this process is the removal of a whole genome from a cell. the most known example is the enucleation process of erythrocytes. a processed stem cell goes through changes causing it to lose a nucleus. in the beginning phase, pro-erythroblast goes through another mitotic divisions, in which an erythroblast with a smaller nucleus is created and moved to the side of the cell. the nucleus becomes isolated from cytoplasm and then erythroblast is divided into reticulocyte with cytoplasm and pyrenocyte with condensed nucleus. pyrenocyte with all genetic material from cell is degraded then by a macrophage. loss of genome is in this case advantageous, since pyrenocyte can accumulate more hemoglobin. mature red blood cell without a nucleus, can properly deliver oxygen.


== chromatin diminution ==
chromatin diminution is a process of partial elimination of chromatin genetic material from genome of prospective somatic cells. this process was found to occur during the early developmental stage in three groups: nematodes, copepods, and hagfish one of the first studies regarding somatic genome processing was observed by boveri large-scale chromatin elimination in parasitic nematode parascaris univalens. during chromatin diminution, somatic chromosomes becomes fragmented with new telomeres added in many different places and devoid of heterochromatin so it differs from germline cell in respect of structure and genetic content. germline cells of p. univalens contain only two chromosomes, but in early embryogenesis central euchromatic regions of the chromosomes fragment into diploid somatic set of 2×29 autosomes and  2×6 x chromosomes in females or 2×29 autosomes and 6 x chromosomes in males, which segregate to the two daughter nuclei. after all heterochromatin becomes degraded in cytoplasm. as a result of chromatin diminution p. univalens loses about 80–90% of the total nuclear germ line dna.chromatin diminution occurs also in unicellular eukaryotes, such as ciliates. ciliates have two nuclei: micronucleus (germ-line cell nucleus) that does not express genes and macronucleus, where most genes are expressed, and is subject to chromatin elimination. during this process chromosomes are fragmented, chromatin eliminated and new dna molecules with added telomeres are created. the final macronucleus has greater genetic content than micronucleus. in ciliates there are two types of diminution: the first is fragmentation of genome and loss of repetitive sequences and the second is deletion of internally eliminated sequences in chromosomes and the rejoining of remaining dna fragments.


== gene unscrambling ==
gene unscrambling is type of genome-wide processing found particularly in ciliates. the germline genes in the micronucleus of ciliates are composed of protein-coding dna fragments (mdss) interrupted by many non-coding dna sequences, also called internal eliminated (iess).
in the spirotrichea class, to which oxytricha belongs, protein-coding dna fragments in a micronucleus are located in permuted order. during sexual development the genetic content of somatic macronucleus is derived from micronucleus. first some parts, including iess, of micronuclear dna are removed to give transcriptionally active genome in macronucleus. also micronuclear-encoded mdss which are nonsequential must undergo gene unscrambling to be ligated in correct order to give functional genes


== local rearrangements ==
local rearrangements affect specific loci only. such rearrangements, for instance, help create genes that produce a great variation of immunoglobulins in vertebrates. during life, organisms have contact with a large number of antigens. which means that the immune system needs to synthesize a wide range of antibodies. each immunoglobulin is a tetramer consisting of four polypeptides connected by disulfide bridges. they form two long heavy chains and  two short light chains. but vertebrate genome does not code entire genes of heavy and light immunoglobulins, only gene segments. segments of heavy chain are located on chromosome 14, they include 11 constant gene segments (ch), that are preceded by 123-129 variable segments (vh), 27 diversity gene segments (dh) and 9 joining segments (jh), coding different versions of components v, d, j. loci of light chains on chromosome 2 (locus κ) and chromosome 22 (locus λ) have similar structure, but they do not contain d segments. at the early stage of lymphocyte b development, loci of immunoglobulins are rearranged. during rearrangement, segment vh on heavy chain locus is connected with one dh segment, then v-d group is combined with jh segment. eventually, exon with open reading frame coding segments: vh, dh, jh of immunoglobulin. through rna splicing during transcription, this exon becomes connected to exon for ch segment. complementary mrna of heavy chain can be translated into immunoglobulin specific only for one lymphocyte.

colin mackenzie (indian army officer),non_science,"lieutenant general colin mackenzie (25 march 1806 - 22 october 1881) was a british officer in the madras army who was active as a political officer in afghanistan.


== early life ==
he was born in london on 25 march 1806, and baptised at st james's church, piccadilly, the youngest son but one of kenneth francis mackenzie (died 1831) and his wife, anne townsend. his father, who belonged to the redcastle branch of mackenzies, was attorney-general of grenada, and lost much during the war with france, 1793–1815. colin mackenzie was educated successively at a school in cumberland, at dollar academy, and at oswestry, and in 1825 was appointed a cadet of infantry on the madras establishment of the east india company.mackenzie served as adjutant of the 48th madras native infantry in the coorg campaign in 1834, during some of which he held the appointment of deputy-assistant quartermaster-general. at the close of the campaign his services were favourably noticed by the brigadier-general commanding the force. in 1836 he accompanied captain chads in an expedition to the straits of malacca, against pirates; mackenzie was on board only as a passenger, but was commended.


== first afghan war ==
lord auckland as governor-general of india selected him in 1840 for the force then serving in afghanistán. mackenzie distinguished himself, first as assistant political agent under george clerk at peshawar. he then went to kabul, where he joined a corps of sappers which had been raised  by george broadfoot, a shipmate of his on his voyage to india. mackenzie led the advanced guard of sir robert sale's force as far as gundamack on its march to jellálabad. he then returned to kabul, where he commanded the godown fort of nishán khán, in which the commissariat of shuja shah durrani's troops was kept; and was in command of this fort when the rising of afghans at kábul broke out. on 3 november, in a difficult position, he fought his way out by night.the following month mackenzie was present at the conference between the envoy, sir william hay macnaghten and akbár khán; he and eldred pottinger had tried to dissuade macnaghten from attending. macnaghten was taken and shot by akbár khán. at the same time mackenzie and george lawrence were made prisoner. later he was freed, and was on the retreat from kábul, in  the course of which he was selected as a hostage. in this position he was deputed by pottinger to convey letters to the political agent at jellálabad and to general sir george pollock, who had reached that place. mackenzie was subsequently moved by akbár khán with the rest of the hostages and prisoners, over the hindu kúsh; but after the arrival of pollock's force in the vicinity of kábul, money was paid for their release.before returning to india mackenzie took part with henry havelock in the assault on the fort of istaliff. mackenzie was refused the kábul medal and the six months' pay which accompanied it, and it was not until 1853 that, after the intervention of lord dalhousie, it was granted to him.


== later life ==
mackenzie was subsequently employed on the north-west frontier to raise a sikh regiment (the 4th), with which he kept the peace of the border during the second anglo-sikh war. he met lord dalhousie, who formed a high opinion of him; mackenzie urged dalhousie that peshawar was the gate of india, and should not be given up. he was still a regimental captain when, in 1850, he was appointed by dalhousie brigadier-general in command of the ellichpúr division of the hyderabad contingent. mackenzie had held his new command for some years when a mutiny occurred in one of the cavalry regiments of the contingent, in which he was wounded, in september 1855, on the occasion of the muharram procession at bolarum. he returned to england for a time.later mackenzie held the political appointment of agent to the governor-general with the nawab of bengal; but was transferred to one of the civil departments of the army as superintendent of army clothing. some years later, on his claiming a divisional command in his own presidency, it was withheld from him by the commander-in-chief on the ground of the censure which had been passed upon him in the bolarum case. on that occasion, the governor of madras, francis, lord napier, and one of the members of council, referred the question to the secretary of state, who declined to interfere.
mackenzie, who was made c.b. in 1867, finally left india in 1873, and died at edinburgh on 22 october 1881. he is buried in the grange cemetery in south edinburgh. 


== family ==
mackenzie married first, in may 1832, adeline, eldest daughter of james pattle of the bengal civil service, who died four years afterwards. he married secondly, in 1843, helen, eldest daughter of admiral john erskine douglas, who survived him, and published several works relating to india, besides the life of her husband. a photogravure portrait of mackenzie, aged 74, was prefixed to mrs. mackenzie's storms and sunshine (edinburgh, 1884, 2 vols.).

nitrofurantoin,antibiotic,"nitrofurantoin is an antibacterial medication used to treat bladder infections, ear infections, and minor skin infections, but is not as effective for kidney infections. it is taken by mouth.common side effects include nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and headaches. rarely numbness, lung problems, or liver problems may occur. it should not be used in people with kidney problems. while it appears to be generally safe during pregnancy it should not be used near delivery. while it usually works by slowing bacterial growth, it may result in bacterial death at the high concentrations found in urine.nitrofurantoin was first sold in 1953. it is on the world health organization's list of essential medicines. it is available as a generic medication. in 2017, it was the 185th most commonly prescribed medication in the united states, with more than three million prescriptions.


== medical uses ==

current uses include the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (utis) and prophylaxis against utis in people prone to recurrent utis.increasing bacterial antibiotic resistance to other commonly used agents, such as fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, has led to increased interest in using nitrofurantoin.  the efficacy of nitrofurantoin in treating utis combined with a low rate of bacterial resistance to this agent makes it one of the first-line agents for treating uncomplicated utis as recommended by the infectious diseases society of america and the european society for microbiology and infectious diseases.nitrofurantoin is not recommended for the treatment of pyelonephritis, prostatitis, and intra-abdominal abscess, because of extremely poor tissue penetration and low blood levels.


=== antibacterial activity ===
nitrofurantoin has been shown to have good activity against:

e. coli
staphylococcus saprophyticus
coagulase negative staphylococci
enterococcus faecalis
staphylococcus aureus
streptococcus agalactiae
citrobacter species
klebsiella species
bacillus subtilis speciesit is used in the treatment of infections caused by these organisms.many or all strains of the following genera are resistant to nitrofurantoin:
enterobacter
proteus
pseudomonasantibiotic susceptibility testing should always be performed to further elucidate the resistance profile of the particular strain of bacteria causing infection.


=== pregnancy ===
nitrofurantoin is pregnancy category b in the united states and pregnancy category a in australia. it is one of the few drugs commonly used in pregnancy to treat utis. it however should not be used in late pregnancy due to the potential risk of hemolytic anemia in the newborn. newborns of women given this drug late in pregnancy had a higher risk of developing neonatal jaundice.evidence of safety in early pregnancy is mixed as of 2017. the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists states that while they can be used in the first trimester other options may be preferred. they remain a first line treatment in the second trimester. a 2015 meta analysis found no increased risk from first trimester use in cohort studies that was a slight increase of malformations in case control studies.


== adverse effects ==
the most common side effects with nitrofurantoin are nausea, headache, and flatulence. less common adverse events (occurring in less than 1% of those taking the drug) include:
gastrointestinal: diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, constipation, emesis
neurologic: dizziness, drowsiness, amblyopia
respiratory: acute pulmonary hypersensitivity reaction
allergic: pruritus, urticaria
dermatologic: hair loss
miscellaneous: fever, chills, malaisepatients should be informed that nitrofurantoin colours urine brown; this is completely harmless.some of the more serious but rare side effects of nitrofurantoin have been a cause of concern. these include pulmonary reactions, hepatotoxicity, and neuropathy.


=== pulmonary toxicity ===
the pulmonary toxicity caused by nitrofurantoin can be categorized into acute, subacute, and chronic pulmonary reactions. the acute and subacute reactions are thought to be due to a hypersensitivity reaction and often resolve when the drug is discontinued. acute reactions have been estimated to occur in about one in 5000 women who take the drug. these reactions usually develop 3–8 days after the first dose of nitrofurantoin, but may occur from a few hours to a few weeks after starting the drug. symptoms include fever, dyspnea, chills, cough, pleuritic chest pain, headache, back pain, and epigastric pain.  chest radiograph will often show unilateral or bilateral infiltrates similar to pulmonary edema. treatment includes discontinuation of the nitrofurantoin, which should result in symptom improvement within 24 hours.chronic pulmonary reactions caused by nitrofurantoin include diffuse interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, or both. this uncommon reaction may occur 1 month to 6 years after starting the drug and is usually related to its total lifetime dose. this reaction manifests with progressive shortness of breath. it is important to recognize nitrofurantoin as possible cause of symptoms and discontinue the drug when the suspicion of pulmonary side effects arises as it can be reversible if the drug is stopped early.


=== hepatotoxicity ===
hepatic reactions, including hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, chronic active hepatitis, and hepatic necrosis, occur rarely. the onset of chronic active hepatitis may be insidious, and patients should be monitored periodically for changes in biochemical tests that would indicate liver injury. these reactions usually occur after exposure to the drug for more than 6 weeks. if signs of liver failure are observed in a patient taking nitrofurantoin, the drug should be discontinued. re-challenge with the drug at a later date is not recommended, as the reaction may have a hypersensitivity component and recur when the drug is resumed.


=== neuropathy ===
neuropathy is a rare side effect of taking nitrofurantoin. patients may experience numbness and tingling in a stocking-glove pattern, which may or may not improve upon discontinuation of the drug.


=== contraindications ===
nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in patients with decreased renal function (crcl < 60 ml/min) due to systemic accumulation and subtherapeutic levels reached in the urinary tract. however, a retrospective chart review suggests the data for this cutoff are slim and a cutoff of crcl < 40 ml/min would be more appropriate. many of the severe side effects of this drug are more common in the elderly and those with renal impairment, as this causes the drug to be retained in the body and reach higher systemic levels. thus, the drug is not recommended for the elderly population according to 2012 ags beers criteria.nitrofurantoin is also contraindicated in babies up to the age of one month, as they have immature enzyme systems in their red blood cells (glutathione instability), so nitrofurantoin must not be used because it can cause haemolytic anaemia. for the same reason, nitrofurantoin should not be given to pregnant women after 38 weeks of pregnancy. nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (g6pd) because of risk of intravascular hemolysis resulting in anemia.


== pharmacology ==
organisms are said to be susceptible to nitrofurantoin if their minimum inhibitory concentration is 32 μg/ml or less. the peak blood concentration of nitrofurantoin following an oral dose of nitrofurantoin 100 mg is less than 1 μg/ml and may be undetectable. its bioavailability is about 90% and the urinary excretion is 40% tissue penetration is negligible; the drug is well concentrated in the urine: 75% of the dose is rapidly metabolised by the liver, but 25% of the dose is excreted in the urine unchanged, reliably achieving levels of 200 μg/ml or more. in studies of dogs, the majority of urinary excretion is through glomerular filtration with some tubular secretion. there is also tubular absorption which is increased with urine acidification. however the activity of nitrofurantoin is also ph dependent and mean inhibitory concentration rises sharply with increased ph above 6. nitrofurantoin cannot be used to treat infections other than simple cystitis.
at the concentrations achieved in urine (>100 μg/ml), nitrofurantoin is a bactericide. it is bacteriostatic against most susceptible organisms at concentrations less than 32 μg/ml.nitrofurantoin and the quinolone antibiotics are mutually antagonistic in vitro. it is not known whether this is of clinical significance, but the combination should be avoided.resistance to nitrofurantoin may be chromosomal or plasmid-mediated and involves inhibition of nitrofuran reductase.  acquired resistance in e. coli continues to be rare.
nitrofurantoin and its metabolites are excreted mainly by the kidneys. in renal impairment, the concentration achieved in urine may be subtherapeutic. nitrofurantoin should not be used in patients with a creatinine clearance of 60 ml/min or less. however, a retrospective chart review may suggest nitrofurantoin is not contraindicated in this population.


=== formulations ===
there are two formulations of nitrofurantoin.

macrocrystals - (macrodantin, furadantin) - 25, 50, or 100 mg capsules -  taken once every 6 hours
monohydrate/macrocrystals - (macrobid) - 100 mg capsules - taken once every 12 hours or 2 times a day (written on prescriptions as bid, which is the last part of the trade name macrobid). it is 75% monohydrate and 25% macrocrystals.


== mechanism of action ==
nitrofurantoin is concentrated in the urine, leading to higher and more effective levels in the urinary tract than in other tissues or compartments. with a 100 mg oral dose, plasma levels are typically less than 1 µg/ml while in the urine it reaches 200 µg/ml.the drug works by damaging bacterial dna, since its reduced form is highly reactive. this is made possible by the rapid reduction of nitrofurantoin inside the bacterial cell by flavoproteins (nitrofuran reductase) to multiple reactive intermediates that attack ribosomal proteins, dna, respiration, pyruvate metabolism and other macromolecules within the cell. nitrofurantoin exerts greater effects on bacterial cells than mammalian cells because bacterial cells activate the drug more rapidly. it is not known which of the actions of nitrofurantoin is primarily responsible for its bactericidal activity. the broad mechanism of action for this drug likely is responsible for the low development of resistance to its effects, as the drug affects many different processes important to the bacterial cell.


== history ==
nitrofurantoin has been available for the treatment of lower urinary tract infections (utis) since 1953.


== animal feed ==
residues from the breakdown of nitrofuran veterinary antibiotics, including nitrofurantoin, have been found in chicken in vietnam, china, brazil, and thailand. the european union banned the use of nitrofurans in food producing animals by classifying it in annex iv (list of pharmacologically active substances for which no maximum residue limits can be fixed) of the council regulation 2377/90. the food and drug administration (fda) of the united states has prohibited furaltadone since february 1985 and withdrew the approval for the other nitrofuran drugs (except some topical uses) in january 1992. the topical use of furazolidone and nitrofurazone was prohibited in 2002. australia prohibited the use of nitrofurans in food production in 1992. japan did not allocate mrls for nitrofurans leading to the implementation of a ""zero tolerance or no residue standard"". in thailand, the ministry of health issued in 2001 proclamation no. 231 mrl of veterinary drug in food which did not allocate mrl for nitrofurans. the ministry of agriculture and cooperatives had already prohibited importation and use of furazolidone and nitrofurazone in animal feed in 1999 which was extended to all nitrofurans in 2002. several metabolites of nitrofurans, such as furazolidone, furaltadone and nitrofurazone cause cancer or genetic damage in rats.


== society and culture ==
it is available as a generic medication.the cost of the liquid formulation of nitrofurantoin in the u.s. became controversial after a 400% price increase. there are two manufacturers of the liquid formulation in the u.s., casper pharma and nostrum laboratories. in 2018, casper increased their price to $2,800.  in response to casper, nostrum increased their price from $474.75 to $2,392. in the u.k., a slightly larger bottle costs £446.95. in an interview with the financial times, nirmal mulye, nostrum chief executive, said that there was a ""moral requirement to sell the product at the highest price."" he defended martin shkreli, and said, ""this is a capitalist economy and if you can’t make money you can’t stay in business."" mulye also attacked the u.s. food and drug administration as ""incompetent and corrupt."" there is a shortage of liquid nitrofurantoin, because the fda implemented new rules on impurities, he said. mulye dismissed the new rules on impurities as a ""piece of nonsense.""fda commissioner scott gottlieb tweeted a response: ""[t]here’s no moral imperative to price gouge and take advantage of patients. fda will continue to promote competition so speculators and those with no regard to public health consequences can’t take advantage of patients who need medicine.""

louis f. vetter,non_science,"louis fisher vetter (1857–1923 ) was an american businessman, writer and politician in los angeles, california, who was noted for the number of social clubs in which he was active. he was a member of the los angeles city council in 1898–1900.


== personal ==
vetter was born in washington, illinois, in 1857, and in 1886 he came to los angeles to help open the r.g. dun & co. mercantile firm. he returned two years later to manage it, and he remained until leaving the firm in 1890 to go into the insurance business. he was ""prominently associated with the business and political development of the southland"" and was head of the louis f. vetter bonding company in the bradbury building. in 1910 he was one of the incorporators of the los angeles milling company, and he became its vice-president.

a member of the hollywood blue lodge and the knights templar of the masonic brotherhood, vetter was also in the los angeles country club and the bohemian club of san francisco. he was active in the california club, where he lived during the last ten years of his life. he was once referred to as ""the club man of club men, . . . a composite of sagacity and good fellowship.""the los angeles times said of him:

one of the exceptionally clever writers of the scribes, mr. vetter was dramatic correspondent for the new york clipper from 1891 to 1911[,] and his trenchant, though good-natured criticisms attracted attention throughout the country.
vetter died january 1, 1923, in his residence at the california club. a funeral service was conducted at st. john's episcopal church by bishop joseph h. johnson, and cremation followed at hollywood cemetery. active pallbearers were r.w. burnham and joseph scott from the sunset club, r.w. pridham and a.b. cass from the los angeles chamber of commerce, and j.e. fishburn and remson d. bird, president of occidental college, from the bohemian club.


== politics ==
in october 1896 vetter announced that he was a candidate for the office of mayor of los angeles in the december election, but instead the local republican party chose julius h. martin to run on its ticket, and vetter was elected chairman of the republican city and central committee, which had charge of the overall county campaign.in february 1897 vetter announced that he would leave his position on the board of fire commissioners because he was taking part in the formation of a new corporation, the home telephone  company, and the city charter did not allow a city official to compete for ""any sort of franchise.""he was elected to the city council from the 3rd ward on december 5, 1898, for a two-year term. on the council, one of the projects he spoke for was the installation of ""a suitable lavatory in sixth street or central park,"" the present pershing square. he said it could be done by ""raising the bandstand and placing the rooms underneath it."" he also urged that the city electrician be requested ""to see if some means cannot be devised"" to dim the headlights of streetcars while they were ""traveling the crowded streets of the city.""vetter failed of renomination by the local republican party convention after he opposed opening up a district surrounding westlake park, the present mcarthur park, for oil drilling. it was said that vetter had thus earned the enmity of an influential ""oil speculator and money lender,"" w. e. de groot, who was quoted as saying he would spend ten thousand dollars to defeat vetter if he were renominated. this disagreement led to a short bout of fisticuffs when the two men met by happenstance one night in the hotel wellington, and vetter knocked the ""very abusive"" de groot to the floor with a blow to the side of the head.


== legacy ==
his estate was estimated at a value of $300,000 at his death, of which the state of california was to receive about $43,000 in inheritance tax. he left most of his estate to spencer grant of san francisco, ""son of the late mr. grant's closest friend."" he bequeathed more than $5,000 to helen g. currie, his secretary, and $1,000 to mary e. macgowan, another employee.

type d enteroendocrine cell,cell,"enteroendocrine cells are specialized cells of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas with endocrine function. they produce gastrointestinal hormones or peptides in response to various stimuli and release them into the bloodstream for systemic effect, diffuse them as local messengers, or transmit them to the enteric nervous system to activate nervous responses. enteroendocrine cells of the intestine are the most numerous endocrine cells of the body. they constitute an enteric endocrine system as a subset of the endocrine system just as the enteric nervous system is a subset of the nervous system. in a sense they are known to act as chemoreceptors, initiating digestive actions and detecting harmful substances and initiating protective responses. enteroendocrine cells are located in the stomach, in the intestine and in the pancreas.


== intestinal enteroendocrine cells ==
intestinal enteroendocrine cells are not clustered together but spread as single cells throughout the intestinal tract.hormones secreted include somatostatin, motilin, cholecystokinin, neurotensin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and enteroglucagon. the enteroendocrine cells sense the metabolites from intestinal commensal microbiota and, in turn, coordinate antibacterial, mechanical, and metabolic branches of the host intestinal innate immune response to the commensal microbiota.


=== k cell ===
k cells secrete gastric inhibitory peptide, an incretin, which also promotes triglyceride storage.


=== l cell ===
l cells secrete glucagon-like peptide-1, an incretin,  peptide yy3-36, oxyntomodulin and glucagon-like peptide-2. l cells are primarily found in the ileum and large intestine (colon), but some are also found in the duodenum and jejunum.


=== i cell ===
i cells secrete cholecystokinin (cck), and are located in the duodenum and jejunum. they modulate bile secretion, exocrine pancreas secretion, and satiety.


=== g cell ===

stomach enteroendocrine cells, which release gastrin, and stimulate gastric acid secretion.


=== enterochromaffin cell ===
enterochromaffin cells are enteroendocrine and neuroendocrine cells with a close similarity to adrenomedullary chromaffin cells secreting serotonin.


=== enterochromaffin-like cell ===
enterochromaffin-like cells or ecl cells are a type of neuroendocrine cell secreting histamine.


=== n cell ===
located in the jejunum, n cells release neurotensin, and control smooth muscle contraction.


=== s cell ===

s cells secrete secretin from the duodenum and jejunum, and stimulate exocrine pancreatic secretion.


=== d cell ===

also called delta cells, d cells secrete somatostatin.


=== mo cell (or m cell) ===
different from the microfold cells (m cells) that are in peyer's patches.
secrete motilin


== gastric enteroendocrine cells ==
gastric enteroendocrine cells are found in the gastric glands, mostly at their base. the g cells  secrete gastrin, post-ganglionic fibers of the vagus nerve can release gastrin-releasing peptide during parasympathetic stimulation to stimulate secretion. enterochromaffin-like cells are enteroendocrine and  neuroendocrine cells also known for their similarity to chromaffin cells secreting histamine, which stimulates g cells to secrete gastrin.
other hormones produced include cholecystokinin, somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance p, alpha and gamma-endorphin.


== pancreatic enteroendocrine cells ==
pancreatic enteroendocrine cells are located in the islets of langerhans and produce most importantly the hormones insulin and glucagon. the autonomous nervous system strongly regulates their secretion, with parasympathetic stimulation stimulating insulin secretion and inhibiting glucagon secretion and sympathetic stimulation having opposite effect.other hormones produced include somatostatin, pancreatic polypeptide, amylin and ghrelin.


== clinical significance ==
rare and slow growing carcinoid and non-carcinoid tumors develop from these cells. when a tumor arises it has the capacity to secrete large volumes of hormones.


== history ==
the very discovery of hormones occurred during studies of how the digestive system regulates its activities, as explained at secretin § discovery.

nicotine metered dose inhaler,drug,"a metered-dose inhaler (mdi) is a device that delivers a specific amount of medication to the lungs, in the form of a short burst of aerosolized medicine that is usually self-administered by the patient via inhalation. it is the most commonly used delivery system for treating asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) and other respiratory diseases. the medication in a metered dose inhaler is most commonly a bronchodilator, corticosteroid or a combination of both for the treatment of asthma and copd. other medications less commonly used but also administered by mdi are mast cell stabilizers, such as cromoglicate or nedocromil.


== description ==

a metered-dose inhaler consists of three major components; the canister which is produced in aluminium or stainless steel by means of deep drawing, where the formulation resides; the metering valve, which allows a metered quantity of the formulation to be dispensed with each actuation; and an actuator (or mouthpiece) which allows the patient to operate the device and directs the aerosol into the patient's lungs., the formulation itself is made up of the drug, a liquefied gas propellant and, in many cases, stabilising excipients. the actuator contains the mating discharge nozzle and generally includes a dust cap to prevent contamination.
to use the inhaler the patient presses down on the top of the canister, with their thumb supporting the lower portion of the actuator. actuation of the device releases a single metered dose of the formulation which contains the medication either dissolved or suspended in the propellant. breakup of the volatile propellant into droplets, followed by rapid evaporation of these droplets, results in the generation of an aerosol consisting of micrometer-sized medication particles that are then inhaled.


== uses ==
metered-dose inhalers are only one type of inhaler, but they are the most commonly used type. the replacement of chlorofluorocarbons propellants with hydrofluoroalkanes (hfa) resulted in the redesign of metered-dose inhalers in the 1990s. for one variety of beclomethasone inhaler, this redesign resulted in considerably smaller aerosol particles being produced, and led to an increase of potency by a factor of 2.6.
asthma inhalers contain a medication that treats the symptoms of asthma.
nicotine inhalers allows cigarette smokers to get nicotine without using tobacco, much like nicotine gum or a nicotine patch. the us food and drug administration (fda) has approved some nicotine inhaler product(s?) for smoking cessation. nicotine inhalers that are marketed as nicotine replacement therapy should not be confused with electronic cigarettes, which produce an aerosol, usually from a tobacco extract, using a heating coil, while nicotine inhalers produce a noncombusted nicotine aerosol. a study found that ""levels of carcinogens and toxins in e-cigarettes typically exceeded those measured in an fda-approved nicotine inhaler"". nicotine inhalers are also known by their nickname of “the puffer”. these devices are made of thin plastic, sometimes resembling a cigarette, or a cylinder shape. they contain a porous nicotine-filled plug, located in the base of the product. when you puff on the inhaler, nicotine aerosol is inhaled and absorbed in the mouth’s lining. every inhaler delivers almost four hundred puffs of this nicotine vapor. the nicotine inhaler is also temperature sensitive. in cooler weather, less nicotine is delivered. the nicotine inhaler is considered easier to use than the electronic cigarette as it is usually disposable, and contains fewer parts than the electronic cigarette.
dry powder inhalers  involve micronised powder often packaged in single dose quantities in blisters or gel capsules containing the powdered medication to be drawn into the lungs by the user's own breath. these systems tend to be more expensive than the mdi, and patients with severely compromised lung function, such as occurs during an asthma attack, may find it difficult to generate enough airflow to get good function from them.
metered-dose inhalers can be used to treat copd, both in stable state and during lung attacks.


== history ==
before the invention of the mdi, asthma medication was delivered using a squeeze bulb nebulizer which was fragile and unreliable.  the relatively crude nature of these devices also meant that the particles that they generated were relatively large, too large for effective drug delivery to the lungs.  nonetheless these nebulizers paved the way for inhalation drug delivery providing the inspiration for the mdi.
mdis were first developed in 1955 by riker laboratories, now a subsidiary of 3m healthcare.  at that time mdis represented a convergence of two relatively new technologies, the cfc propellant and the meshburg metering valve which was originally designed for dispensing perfume. the initial design by riker used a glass canister coated with a vinyl plastic to improve its resilience.  by 1956 riker had developed two mdi based products, the medihaler-ept containing epinephrine and the medihaler-iso containing isoprenaline.  both products are agonists which provide short term relief from asthma symptoms and have now largely been replaced in asthma treatment by salbutamol, which is more selective.


== spacers ==

metered-dose inhalers are sometimes used with add-on devices referred to as holding chambers or spacers, which are tubes attached to the inhaler that act as a reservoir or holding chamber and reduce the speed at which the aerosol enters the mouth. they serve to hold the medication that is sprayed by the inhaler. this makes it easier to use the inhaler and helps ensure that more of the medication gets into the lungs instead of just into the mouth or the air. with proper use, a spacer can make an inhaler somewhat more effective in delivering medicine.spacers can be especially helpful to adults and children who find a regular metered dose inhaler hard to use. people who use corticosteroid inhalers should use a spacer to prevent getting the medicine in their mouth, where oral yeast infections and dysphonia can occur.


== lifespan and replacement ==
the deposition of the content of drug formulation on the canister surface can result in a shorter shelf life of an mdi inhaler. applying a suitable surface coating to the components helps to extend this shelf life. over the years a range of coating processes have been developed that can be applied to both the canister and valve to protect the contents from deposition and degradation.
gas plasma processing is an industrial technique that is carried out in a vacuum to coat the entire mdi inhaler and involves constant or pulsed excitation of gas by either radio frequency (rf) or microwave field to produce an energetic plasma. this coating ensures that the drug formulation does not stick to the interior wall of the md inhaler and results in the patient receiving the prescribed dose of medication, whilst also extending the product's shelf-life.
a metered dose inhaler contains enough medication for a certain number of actuations (or ""puffs"") which is printed on the canister.  even though the inhaler may continue to work beyond that number of uses, the amount of medication delivered may not be correct. it is important to keep track of the number of times an inhaler was used, so that it can be replaced after its recommended number of uses. for this reason, several regulatory authorities have requested that manufacturers add a dose counter or dose indicator to the actuator. several inhalation products are now sold with a dose counter-actuator. depending on the manufacturer and the product, inhalers are sold as a complete unit or the individual canister as a refill prescription.


== inhaler technique and use ==
while mdis are commonly used in the treatment of lung-based disorders, their use requires dexterity to complete the required sequential steps to achieve application of these devices.  incorrect completion of one or more steps in the use of an mdi can substantially reduce the delivery of the administrated medication and consequently its effectiveness and safety. numerous studies have demonstrated that between 50-100% of patients do not use their inhaler devices correctly, with patients often unaware that they are using their inhaled medication incorrectly. incorrect inhaler technique has been associated with poorer outcomes. incorrect maintenance and cleaning of metered dose inhalers is also an issue identified in many users, highlighting the need for clear guidance for patients prescribed mdis.


== propellants ==

one of the most crucial components of a mdi is its propellant. the propellant provides the force to generate the aerosol cloud and is also the medium in which the active component must be suspended or dissolved. propellants in mdis typically make up more than 99% of the delivered dose, so it is the properties of the propellant that dominate more than any other individual factor.  this is often overlooked in literature and in industry because so few propellants are used and their contribution is often taken for granted.  suitable propellants must pass a stringent set of criteria, they must:

have a boiling point in the range -100 to +30 °c 
have a density of approximately 1.2 to 1.5 g cm−3 (approximately that of the drug to be suspended or dissolved)
have a vapour pressure of 40 to 80 psig 
have no toxicity to the patient 
be non-flammable 
be able to dissolve common additives (active ingredients should be either fully soluble or fully insoluble)


=== chlorofluorocarbons (cfcs) ===
in the early days of mdis the most commonly used propellants were the chlorofluorocarbons cfc-11, cfc-12 and cfc-114.
in 2008 the food and drug administration announced that inhalers using chlorofluorocarbons as a propellant, such as primatene mist, could no longer be manufactured or sold as of 2012. this followed from the u.s. decision to agree to the 1987 montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer.


=== hydrofluorocarbons ===
cfc propellants have been replaced by hydrofluorocarbon propellants. concerns about the use of hydrofluorocarbon propellants have however since arisen since these compounds are potent greenhouse gases; propellant released during the use of a single inhaler results in a greenhouse footprint equivalent to greenhouse gases released during a 180-mile car journey.


== surfactant lipids ==
phospholipids are important natural surfactant lipids  used in enhancing penetration and bioavailability. phospholipids act by reducing the high surface tension forces at the air-water interface within the alveoli, thereby reducing the pressure needed to expand the lungs, thus, commercially available formulations of phospholipids have been designed to spread rapidly over an air-aqueous interface, thereby reducing what is otherwise a very high surface tension of water.

carbon group molecular entity,reagent,"molecular symmetry in chemistry describes the symmetry present in molecules and the classification of molecules according to their symmetry.  molecular symmetry is a fundamental concept in chemistry, as it can be used to predict or explain many of a molecule's chemical properties, such as its dipole moment and its allowed spectroscopic transitions.to do this it is necessary to classify the states of the molecule using the irreducible representations 
from the character table of the symmetry group of the molecule.  many university level textbooks on physical chemistry, quantum chemistry, spectroscopy and inorganic chemistry devote a chapter to symmetry.the framework for the study of molecular symmetry is provided by group theory, and in particular irreducible representation theory. symmetry is useful in the study of molecular orbitals, with applications such as the hückel method, ligand field theory, and the woodward-hoffmann rules. another framework on a larger scale is the use of crystal systems to describe crystallographic symmetry in bulk materials.  
many techniques for the practical assessment of molecular symmetry exist, including x-ray crystallography and various forms of spectroscopy. spectroscopic notation is based on symmetry considerations.

   results in a molecule indistinguishable from the original.  this is also called an n-fold rotational axis and abbreviated cn.  examples are the c2 axis in water and the c3 axis in ammonia. a molecule can have more than one symmetry axis; the one with the highest n is called the principal axis, and by convention is aligned with the z-axis in a cartesian coordinate system.
plane of symmetry: a plane of reflection through which an identical copy of the original molecule is generated.  this is also called a mirror plane and abbreviated σ (sigma = greek ""s"", from the german 'spiegel' meaning mirror). water has two of them: one in the plane of the molecule itself and one perpendicular to it. a symmetry plane parallel with the principal axis is dubbed vertical (σv) and one perpendicular to it horizontal (σh). a third type of symmetry plane exists: if a vertical symmetry plane additionally bisects the angle between two 2-fold rotation axes perpendicular to the principal axis, the plane is dubbed dihedral (σd). a symmetry plane can also be identified by its cartesian orientation, e.g., (xz) or (yz).
center of symmetry or inversion center, abbreviated i.  a molecule has a center of symmetry when, for any atom in the molecule, an identical atom exists diametrically opposite this center an equal distance from it. in other words, a molecule has a center of symmetry when the points (x,y,z) and (−x,−y,−z) correspond to identical objects. for example, if there is an oxygen atom in some point (x,y,z), then there is an oxygen atom in the point (−x,−y,−z).  there may or may not be an atom at the inversion center itself.  examples are xenon tetrafluoride  where the inversion center is at the xe atom, and benzene (c6h6) where the inversion center is at the center of the ring.

  , followed by a reflection in a plane perpendicular to it, leaves the molecule unchanged.  also called  an n-fold improper rotation axis, it is abbreviated sn.  examples are present in tetrahedral silicon tetrafluoride, with three s4 axes, and the staggered conformation of ethane with one s6 axis. an s1 axis  corresponds to a mirror plane σ and an s2 axis is an inversion center i. a molecule which has no sn axis for any value of n is a chiral molecule.
identity, abbreviated to e, from the german 'einheit' meaning unity. this symmetry element simply consists of no change: every molecule has this element. while this element seems physically trivial, it must be included in the list of symmetry elements so that they form a mathematical group, whose definition requires inclusion of the identity element. it is so called because it is analogous to multiplying by one (unity). in other words, e is a property that any object needs to have regardless of its symmetry properties.


=== operations ===
  
the five symmetry elements have associated with them five types of symmetry operation, which leave the molecule in a state indistinguishable from the starting state. they are sometimes distinguished from symmetry elements by a caret or circumflex. thus, ĉn is the rotation of a molecule around an axis and ê is the identity operation. a symmetry element can have more than one symmetry operation associated with it. for example, the c4 axis of the square xenon tetrafluoride (xef4) molecule is associated with two ĉ4 rotations (90°) in opposite directions and a ĉ2 rotation (180°). since ĉ1 is equivalent to ê, ŝ1 to σ and ŝ2 to î,  all symmetry operations can be classified as either proper or improper rotations. 
for linear molecules, either clockwise or counterclockwise rotation about the molecular axis by any angle φ is a symmetry operation.


== symmetry groups ==


=== groups ===
the symmetry operations of a molecule (or other object) form a group. in mathematics, a group is a set with a binary operation that satisfies the four properties listed below. 
in a symmetry group, the group elements are the symmetry operations (not the symmetry elements), and the binary combination consists of applying first one symmetry operation and then the other. an example is the sequence of a c4 rotation about the z-axis and a reflection in the xy-plane, denoted σ(xy)c4. by convention the order of operations is from right to left.
a symmetry group obeys the defining properties of any group.
(1) closure property:                 
for every pair of elements x and y in g, the product x*y is also in g.                  ( in symbols, for every two elements x, y∈g, x*y is also in g ). this means that the group is closed so that combining two elements produces no new elements. symmetry operations have this property because a sequence of two operations will produce a third state indistinguishable from the second and therefore from the first, so that the net effect on the molecule is still a symmetry operation.
(2) associative property:                 
for every x and y and z in g, both (x*y)*z and x*(y*z)  result with the same element in g.                  
( in symbols, (x*y)*z = x*(y*z ) for every x, y, and z ∈ g)
(3) existence of identity property:                 
there must be an element ( say e ) in  g such that product any element of g with e make no change to the element.                  
( in symbols, x*e=e*x= x for every x∈ g )
(4) existence of inverse property:                  
for each element ( x ) in  g, there must be an element y in  g such that product  of  x and y is the identity element e.                 
( in symbols, for each  x∈g  there is a y ∈ g such that x*y=y*x= e for every x∈g )
the order of a group is the number of elements in the group. for groups of small orders, the group properties can be easily verified by considering its composition table, a table whose rows and columns correspond to elements of the group and whose entries correspond to their products.


=== point groups and permutation-inversion groups ===

the successive application (or composition) of one or more symmetry operations of a molecule has an effect equivalent to that of some single symmetry operation of the molecule. for example, a c2 rotation followed by a σv reflection is seen to be a σv' symmetry operation: σv*c2 = σv'. (""operation a followed by b to form c"" is written ba = c). moreover, the set of all symmetry operations (including this composition operation) obeys all the properties of a group, given above. so (s,*) is a group, where s is the set of all symmetry operations of some molecule, and * denotes the composition (repeated application) of symmetry operations.
this group is called the point group of that molecule, because the set of symmetry operations leave at least one point fixed (though for some symmetries an entire axis or an entire plane remains fixed). in other words, a point group is a group that summarizes all symmetry operations that all molecules in that category have. the symmetry of a crystal, by contrast, is described by a space group of symmetry operations, which includes translations in space.
one can determine the symmetry operations of the point group for a particular molecule by considering the geometrical symmetry of its molecular model. however, when one uses a point group to classify molecular states, the operations in it are not to be interpreted in the same way. instead the operations are interpreted as rotating and/or reflecting the vibronic (vibration-electronic) coordinates and these operations commute with the vibronic hamiltonian. they are ""symmetry operations"" for that vibronic hamiltonian. the point group is used to classify by symmetry the vibronic eigenstates. the symmetry classification of the rotational levels, the eigenstates of the full (rotation-vibration-electronic) hamiltonian, requires the use of the appropriate permutation-inversion group as introduced by longuet-higgins.


=== examples of point groups ===
assigning each molecule a point group classifies molecules into categories with similar symmetry properties. for example, pcl3, pof3, xeo3, and nh3 all share identical symmetry operations. they all can undergo the identity operation e, two different c3 rotation operations, and three different σv plane reflections without altering their identities, so they are placed in one point group, c3v, with order 6. similarly, water (h2o) and hydrogen sulfide (h2s) also share identical symmetry operations. they both undergo the identity operation e, one c2 rotation, and two σv reflections without altering their identities, so they are both placed in one point group, c2v, with order 4. this classification system helps scientists to study molecules more efficiently, since chemically related molecules in the same point group tend to exhibit similar bonding schemes, molecular bonding diagrams, and spectroscopic properties.


=== common point groups ===
the following table contains a list of point groups labelled using the schoenflies notation, which is common in chemistry and molecular spectroscopy. the description of structure includes common shapes of molecules, which can be explained by the vsepr model.


=== representations ===
the symmetry operations can be represented in many ways. a convenient representation is by matrices. for any vector representing a point in cartesian coordinates, left-multiplying it gives the new location of the point transformed by the symmetry operation. composition of operations corresponds to matrix multiplication. within a point group, a multiplication of the matrices of two symmetry operations leads to a matrix of another symmetry operation in the same point group. for instance, in the c2v example this is:

  although an infinite number of such representations exist, the irreducible representations (or ""irreps"") of the group are commonly used, as all other representations of the group can be described as a linear combination of the irreducible representations.


== character tables ==

for each point group, a character table summarizes information on its symmetry operations and on its irreducible representations. as there are always equal numbers of irreducible representations and classes of symmetry operations, the tables are square.
the table itself consists of characters that represent how a particular irreducible representation transforms when a particular symmetry operation is applied.  any symmetry operation in a molecule's point group acting on the molecule itself will leave it unchanged.  but, for acting on a general entity, such as a vector or an orbital, this need not be the case.  the vector could change sign or direction, and the orbital could change type.  for simple point groups, the values are either 1 or −1: 1 means that the sign or phase (of the vector or orbital) is unchanged by the symmetry operation (symmetric) and −1 denotes a sign change (asymmetric).
the representations are labeled according to a set of conventions:

a, when rotation around the principal axis is symmetrical
b, when rotation around the principal axis is asymmetrical
e and t are doubly and triply degenerate representations, respectively
when the point group has an inversion center, the subscript g (german: gerade or even) signals no change in sign, and the subscript u (ungerade or uneven) a change in sign, with respect to inversion.
with point groups c∞v and d∞h the symbols are borrowed from angular momentum description: σ, π, δ.the tables also capture information about how the cartesian basis vectors, rotations about them, and quadratic functions of them transform by the symmetry operations of the group, by noting which irreducible representation transforms in the same way.  these indications are conventionally on the righthand side of the tables.  this information is useful because chemically important orbitals (in particular p and d orbitals) have the same symmetries as these entities.
the character table for the c2v symmetry point group is given below:

consider the example of water (h2o), which has the c2v symmetry described above.  the 2px orbital of oxygen has b1 symmetry as in the fourth row of the character table above, with x in the sixth column). it is oriented perpendicular to the plane of the molecule and switches sign with a c2 and a σv'(yz) operation, but remains unchanged with the other two operations (obviously, the character for the identity operation is always +1). this orbital's character set is thus {1, −1, 1, −1}, corresponding to the b1 irreducible representation. likewise, the 2pz orbital is seen to have the symmetry of the a1 irreducible representation (i.e.: none of the symmetry operations change it), 2py b2, and the  3dxy orbital a2.  these assignments and others are noted in the rightmost two columns of the table.


== historical background ==
hans bethe used characters of point group operations in his study of ligand field theory in 1929, and eugene wigner used group theory to explain the selection rules of atomic spectroscopy. the first character tables were compiled by lászló tisza (1933), in connection to vibrational spectra. robert mulliken was the first to publish character tables in english (1933), and e. bright wilson used them in 1934 to predict the symmetry of vibrational normal modes. the complete set of 32 crystallographic point groups was published in 1936 by rosenthal and murphy.


== molecular nonrigidity ==

as discussed above in the section point groups and permutation-inversion groups, point groups are useful for classifying the vibronic states of rigid molecules (sometimes called semi-rigid molecules) which undergo only small oscillations about a single equilibrium geometry. longuet-higgins has introduced a more general type of symmetry group suitable not only for classifying the rovibronic states of rigid molecules but also for classifying the states of non-rigid (or fluxional) molecules that tunnel between equivalent geometries (called versions) and which can also allow for the distorting effects of molecular rotation. these groups are known as permutation-inversion groups, because the symmetry operations in them are energetically feasible permutations of identical nuclei, or  inversion with respect to the center of mass (the parity operation), or a combination of the two.
for example, ethane (c2h6) has three equivalent staggered conformations. tunneling between the conformations occurs at ordinary temperatures by internal rotation of one methyl group relative to the other. this is not a rotation of the entire molecule about the c3 axis. although each conformation has d3d symmetry, as in the table above, description of the internal rotation and associated quantum states and energy levels requires the more complete permutation-inversion group g36.
similarly, ammonia (nh3) has two equivalent pyramidal (c3v) conformations which are interconverted by the process known as nitrogen inversion. this is not the point group inversion operation i used for centrosymmetric rigid molecules (i.e., the inversion of vibrational displacements and electronic coordinates in the nuclear center of mass) since nh3 has no inversion center and is not centrosymmetric. rather it the inversion of the nuclear and electronic coordinates in the molecular center of mass (sometimes called the parity operation), which happens to be energetically feasible for this molecule. the appropriate permutation-inversion group to be used in this situation is d3h(m) which is isomorphic with the point group d3h.
additionally, as examples, the methane (ch4) and h3+ molecules have highly symmetric equilibrium structures with td and d3h point group symmetries respectively; they lack permanent electric dipole moments but they do have very weak pure rotation spectra because of rotational
centrifugal distortion. the permutation-inversion groups required for the complete study of ch4 and h3+ are td(m) and d3h(m), respectively.
a second and less general approach to the symmetry of nonrigid molecules is due to altmann. in this approach the symmetry groups are known as schrödinger supergroups and consist of two types of operations (and their combinations): (1) the geometric symmetry operations (rotations, reflections, inversions) of rigid molecules, and (2) isodynamic operations, which take a nonrigid molecule into an energetically equivalent form by a physically  reasonable process such as rotation about a single bond (as in ethane) or a molecular inversion (as in ammonia).

stem cell of epidermis,cell,"the epidermis (from the greek ἐπιδερμίς, meaning ""over-skin"") is a single layer of cells that covers the leaves, flowers, roots and stems of plants. it forms a boundary between the plant and the external environment. the epidermis serves several functions: it protects against water loss, regulate gas exchange, secretes metabolic compounds, and (especially in roots) absorbs water and mineral nutrients. the epidermis of most leaves shows dorsoventral anatomy: the upper (adaxial) and lower (abaxial) surfaces have somewhat different construction and may serve different functions. woody stems and some other stem structures such as potato tubers produce a secondary covering called the periderm that replaces the epidermis as the protective covering.


== description ==
the epidermis is the outermost cell layer of the primary plant body. in some older works the cells of the leaf epidermis have been regarded as specialized parenchyma cells, but the established modern preference has long been to classify the epidermis as dermal tissue, whereas parenchyma is classified as ground tissue. the epidermis is the main component of the dermal tissue system of leaves (diagrammed below), and also stems, roots, flowers, fruits, and seeds; it is usually transparent (epidermal cells have fewer chloroplasts or lack them completely, except for the guard cells.)
the cells of the epidermis are structurally and functionally variable. most plants have an epidermis that is a single cell layer thick. some plants like ficus elastica and peperomia, which have a periclinal cellular division within the protoderm of the leaves, have an epidermis with multiple cell layers. epidermal cells are tightly linked to each other and provide mechanical strength and protection to the plant. the walls of the epidermal cells of the above-ground parts of plants contain cutin, and are covered with a cuticle.  the cuticle reduces water loss to the atmosphere, it is sometimes covered with wax in smooth sheets,  granules, plates, tubes, or filaments. the wax layers give some plants a whitish or bluish surface color. surface wax acts as a moisture barrier and protects the plant from intense sunlight and wind. the underside of many leaves have a thinner cuticle than the top side, and leaves of plants from dry climates often have thickened cuticles to conserve water by reducing transpiration.

the epidermal tissue includes several differentiated cell types: epidermal cells, guard cells, subsidiary cells, and epidermal hairs (trichomes). the epidermal cells are the most numerous, largest, and least specialized. these are typically more elongated in the leaves of monocots than in those of dicots.

trichomes or hairs grow out from the epidermis in many species. in the root epidermis, epidermal hairs termed root hairs are common and are specialized for the absorption of water and mineral nutrients.
in plants with secondary growth, the epidermis of roots and stems is usually replaced by a periderm through the action of a cork cambium.


== stoma complex ==

the leaf and stem epidermis is covered with pores called stomata (sing., stoma), part of a stoma complex consisting of a pore surrounded on each side by chloroplast-containing guard cells, and two to four subsidiary cells that lack chloroplasts. the stomata complex regulates the exchange of gases and water vapor between the outside air and the interior of the leaf. typically, the stomata are more numerous over the abaxial (lower) epidermis of the leaf than the (adaxial) upper epidermis. an exception is floating leaves where most or all stomata are on the upper surface. vertical leaves, such as those of many grasses, often have roughly equal numbers of stomata on both surfaces. 
the stoma is bounded by two guard cells. the guard cells differ from the epidermal cells in the following aspects:

the guard cells are bean-shaped in surface view, while the epidermal cells are irregular in shape
the guard cells contain chloroplasts, so they can manufacture food by photosynthesis (the epidermal cells of terrestrial plants do not contain chloroplasts)
guard cells are the only epidermal cells that can make sugar. according to one theory, in sunlight, the concentration of potassium ions (k+) increases in the guard cells. this, together with the sugars formed, lowers the water potential in the guard cells. as a result, water from other cells enters the guard cells by osmosis so they swell and become turgid. because the guard cells have a thicker cellulose wall on one side of the cell, i.e. the side around the stomatal pore, the swollen guard cells become curved and pull the stomata open.at night, the sugar is used up and water leaves the guard cells, so they become flaccid and the stomatal pore closes. in this way, they reduce the amount of water vapor escaping from the leaf.


== cell differentiation in the epidermis ==

the plant epidermis consists of three main cell types: pavement cells, guard cells and their subsidiary cells that surround the stomata and trichomes, otherwise known as leaf hairs. the epidermis of petals also form a variation of trichomes called conical cells.trichomes develop at a distinct phase during leaf development, under the control of two major trichome specification genes: ttg and gl1. the process may be controlled by the plant hormones gibberellins, and even if not completely controlled, gibberellins certainly have an effect on the development of the leaf hairs. gl1 causes endoreplication, the replication of dna without subsequent cell division as well as cell expansion. gl1 turns on the expression of a second gene for trichome formation, gl2, which controls the final stages of trichome formation causing the cellular outgrowth.
arabidopsis thaliana uses the products of inhibitory genes to control the patterning of trichomes, such as ttg and try. the products of these genes will diffuse into the lateral cells, preventing them from forming trichomes and in the case of try promoting the formation of pavement cells.
expression of the gene mixta, or its analogue in other species, later in the process of cellular differentiation will cause the formation of conical cells over trichomes. mixta is a transcription factor.
stomatal patterning is a much more controlled process, as the stoma affects the plant's water retention and respiration capabilities. as a consequence of these important functions, differentiation of cells to form stomata is also subject to environmental conditions to a much greater degree than other epidermal cell types.
stomata are pores in the plant epidermis that are surrounded by two guard cells, which control the opening and closing of the aperture. these guard cells are in turn surrounded by subsidiary cells which provide a supporting role for the guard cells.
stomata begin as stomatal meristemoids. the process varies between dicots and monocots. spacing is thought to be essentially random in dicots though mutants do show it is under some form of genetic control, but it is more controlled in monocots, where stomata arise from specific asymmetric divisions of protoderm cells. the smaller of the two cells produced becomes the guard mother cells. adjacent epidermal cells will also divide asymmetrically to form the subsidiary cells.
because stomata play such an important role in the plants' survival, collecting information on their differentiation is difficult by the traditional means of genetic manipulation, as stomatal mutants tend to be unable to survive. thus the control of the process is not well understood. some genes have been identified. tmm is thought to control the timing of stomatal initiation specification and flp is thought to be involved in preventing the further division of the guard cells once they are formed.
environmental conditions affect the development of stomata, in particular, their density on the leaf surface. it is thought that plant hormones, such as ethylene and cytokines, control the stomatal developmental response to the environmental conditions. accumulation of these hormones appears to cause increased stomatal density such as when the plants are kept in closed environments.

protein s-myc (rat),protein,"myc is a family of regulator genes and proto-oncogenes that code for transcription factors. the myc family consists of three related human genes: c-myc (myc), l-myc (mycl), and n-myc (mycn). c-myc (also sometimes referred to as myc) was the first gene to be discovered in this family, due to homology with the viral gene v-myc.
in cancer, c-myc is often constitutively (persistently) expressed. this leads to the increased expression of many genes, some of which are involved in cell proliferation, contributing to the formation of cancer. a common human translocation involving c-myc is critical to the development of most cases of burkitt lymphoma. constitutive upregulation of myc genes have also been observed in carcinoma of the cervix, colon, breast, lung and stomach.  myc is thus viewed as a promising target for anti-cancer drugs. unfortunately, myc possesses several features that render it undruggable such that any anti-cancer drugs for myc dysregulation will require acting on the protein indirectly, i.e. targeting the mrna for the protein rather than a small molecule that targets the protein itself.in the human genome, c-myc is located on chromosome 8 and is believed to regulate expression of 15% of all genes through binding on enhancer box sequences (e-boxes).
in addition to its role as a classical transcription factor, n-myc may recruit histone acetyltransferases (hats). this allows it to regulate global chromatin structure via histone acetylation.


== discovery ==
the myc family was first established after discovery of homology between an oncogene carried by the avian virus, myelocytomatosis (v-myc; p10395) and a human gene over-expressed in various cancers, cellular myc (c-myc). later, discovery of further homologous genes in humans led to the addition of n-myc and l-myc to the family of genes.the most frequently discussed example of c-myc as a proto-oncogene is its implication in burkitt's lymphoma. in burkitt's lymphoma, cancer cells show chromosomal translocations, most commonly between chromosome 8 and chromosome 14 [t(8;14)]. this causes c-myc to be placed downstream of the highly active immunoglobulin (ig) promoter region, leading to overexpression of myc.


== structure ==
the protein product of myc family genes all belong to the myc family of transcription factors, which contain bhlh (basic helix-loop-helix) and lz (leucine zipper) structural motifs.  the bhlh motif allows myc proteins to bind with dna, while the leucine zipper tf-binding motif allows dimerization with max, another bhlh transcription factor.
myc mrna contains an ires (internal ribosome entry site) that allows the rna to be translated into protein when 5' cap-dependent translation is inhibited, such as during viral infection.


== function ==
myc proteins are transcription factors that activate expression of many pro-proliferative genes through binding enhancer box sequences (e-boxes) and recruiting histone acetyltransferases (hats). myc is thought to function by upregulating transcript elongation of actively transcribed genes through the recruitment of transcriptional elongation factors. it can also act as a transcriptional repressor. by binding miz-1 transcription factor and displacing the p300 co-activator, it inhibits expression of miz-1 target genes. in addition, myc has a direct role in the control of dna replication. this activity could contribute to dna amplification in cancer cells.myc is activated upon various mitogenic signals such as serum stimulation or by wnt, shh and egf (via the mapk/erk pathway).
by modifying the expression of its target genes, myc activation results in numerous biological effects. the first to be discovered was its capability to drive cell proliferation (upregulates cyclins, downregulates p21), but it also plays a very important role in regulating cell growth (upregulates ribosomal rna and proteins), apoptosis (downregulates bcl-2), differentiation, and stem cell self-renewal. nucleotide metabolism genes are upregulated by myc, which are necessary for myc induced proliferation or cell growth.there have been several studies that have clearly indicated myc's role in cell competition.a major effect of c-myc is b cell proliferation, and gain of myc has been associated with b cell malignancies and their increased aggressiveness, including histological transformation. in b cells, myc acts as a classical oncogene by regulating a number of pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic pathways, this also includes tunning of bcr signaling and cd40 signaling is regulation of micrornas (mir-29, mir-150, mir-17-92). c-myc induces mtdh(aeg-1) gene expression and in turn itself requires aeg-1 oncogene for its expression.


== myc-nick ==

myc-nick is a cytoplasmic form of myc produced by a partial proteolytic cleavage of full-length c-myc and n-myc. myc cleavage is mediated by the calpain family of calcium-dependent cytosolic proteases.
the cleavage of myc by calpains is a constitutive process but is enhanced under conditions that require rapid downregulation of myc levels, such as during terminal differentiation. upon cleavage, the c-terminus of myc (containing the dna binding domain) is degraded, while myc-nick, the n-terminal segment 298-residue segment remains in the cytoplasm. myc-nick contains binding domains for histone acetyltransferases and for ubiquitin ligases.
the functions of myc-nick are currently under investigation, but this new myc family member was found to regulate cell morphology, at least in part, by interacting with acetyl transferases to promote the acetylation of α-tubulin. ectopic expression of myc-nick accelerates the differentiation of committed myoblasts into muscle cells.


== clinical significance ==
a large body of evidence shows that myc genes and proteins are highly relevant for treating tumors. except for early response genes, myc universally upregulates gene expression.  furthermore, the upregulation is nonlinear.  genes for which expression is already significantly upregulated in the absence of myc are strongly boosted in the presence of myc, whereas genes for which expression is low in the absence myc get only a small boost when myc is present.inactivation of sumo-activating enzyme (sae1 / sae2) in the presence of myc hyperactivation results in mitotic catastrophe and cell death in cancer cells.  hence inhibitors of sumoylation may be a possible treatment for cancer.amplification of the myc gene was found in a significant number of epithelial ovarian cancer cases. in tcga datasets, the amplification of myc occurs in several cancer types, including breast, colorectal, pancreatic, gastric, and uterine cancers.in the experimental transformation process of normal cells into cancer cells, the myc gene can cooperate with the ras gene.expression of myc is highly dependent on brd4 function in some cancers. bet inhibitors have been used to successfully block myc function in pre-clinical cancer models and are currently being evaluated in clinical trials.


== animal models ==
in drosophila myc is encoded by the diminutive locus, (which was known to geneticists prior to 1935). classical diminutive alleles resulted in a viable animal with small body size. drosophila has subsequently been used to implicate myc in cell competition, endoreplication, and cell growth.during the discovery of myc gene, it was realized that chromosomes that reciprocally translocate to chromosome 8 contained immunoglobulin genes at the break-point. to study the mechanism of tumorigenesis in burkitt lymphoma by mimicking expression pattern of myc in these cancer cells, transgenic mouse models were developed. myc gene placed under the control of igm heavy chain enhancer in transgenic mice gives rise to mainly lymphomas. later on, in order to study effects of myc in other types of cancer, transgenic mice that overexpress myc in different tissues (liver, breast) were also made. in all these mouse models overexpression of myc causes tumorigenesis, illustrating the potency of myc oncogene.
in a study with mice, reduced expression of myc was shown to induce longevity, with significantly extended median and maximum lifespans in both sexes and a reduced mortality rate across all ages, better health, cancer progression was slower, better metabolism and they had smaller bodies. also, less tor, akt, s6k and other changes in energy and metabolic pathways (such as ampk, more oxygen consumption, more body movements, etc.).  the study by john m. sedivy and others used cre-loxp -recombinase to knockout one copy of myc and this resulted in a ""haplo-insufficient"" genotype noted as myc+/-. the phenotypes seen oppose the effects of normal aging and are shared with many other long-lived mouse models such as cr (calorie restriction) ames dwarf, rapamycin, metformin and resveratrol. one study found that myc and p53 genes were key to the survival of chronic myeloid leukaemia (cml) cells. targeting myc and p53 proteins with drugs gave positive results on mice with cml.


== relationship to stem cells ==
myc genes play a number of normal roles in stem cells including pluripotent stem cells. in neural stem cells, n-myc promotes a rapidly proliferative stem cell and precursor-like state in the developing brain, while inhibiting differentiation. in hematopoietic stem cells, myc controls the balance between self-renewal and differentiation.c-myc plays a major role in the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (ipscs). it is one of the original factors discovered by yamanaka et al. to encourage cells to return to a 'stem-like' state alongside transcription factors oct4, sox2 and klf4. it has since been shown that it is possible to generate ipscs without c-myc.

zinc finger protein 330 (human),protein,"a zinc finger is a small protein structural motif that is characterized by the coordination of one or more zinc ions (zn2+) in order to stabilize the fold. it was originally coined to describe the finger-like appearance of a hypothesized structure from the african clawed frog (xenopus laevis) transcription factor iiia. however, it has been found to encompass a wide variety of differing protein structures in eukaryotic cells. xenopus laevis tfiiia was originally demonstrated to contain zinc and require the metal for function in 1983, the first such reported zinc requirement for a gene regulatory protein. it often appears as a metal-binding domain in multi-domain proteins.proteins that contain zinc fingers (zinc finger proteins) are classified into several different structural families. unlike many other clearly defined supersecondary structures such as greek keys or β hairpins, there are a number of types of zinc fingers, each with a unique three-dimensional architecture. a particular zinc finger protein's class is determined by this three-dimensional structure, but it can also be recognized based on the primary structure of the protein or the identity of the ligands coordinating the zinc ion. in spite of the large variety of these proteins, however, the vast majority typically function as interaction modules that bind dna, rna, proteins, or other small, useful molecules, and variations in structure serve primarily to alter the binding specificity of a particular protein.
since their original discovery and the elucidation of their structure, these interaction modules have proven ubiquitous in the biological world and may be found in 3% of the genes of the human genome.  in addition, zinc fingers have become extremely useful in various therapeutic and research capacities. engineering zinc fingers to have an affinity for a specific sequence is an area of active research, and zinc finger nucleases and zinc finger transcription factors are two of the most important applications of this to be realized to date.


== history ==
zinc fingers were first identified in a study of transcription in the african clawed frog, xenopus laevis in the laboratory of aaron klug. a study of the transcription of a particular rna sequence revealed that the binding strength of a small transcription factor (transcription factor iiia; tfiiia) was due to the presence of zinc-coordinating finger-like structures. amino acid sequencing of tfiiia revealed nine tandem sequences of 30 amino acids, including two invariant pairs of cysteine and histidine residues. extended x-ray absorption fine structure confirmed the identity of the zinc ligands: two cysteines and two histidines. the dna-binding loop formed by the coordination of these ligands by zinc were thought to resemble fingers, hence the name. more recent work in the characterization of proteins in various organisms has revealed the importance of zinc ions in polypeptide stabilization.the crystal structures of zinc finger-dna complexes solved in 1991 and 1993 revealed the canonical pattern of interactions of zinc fingers with dna. the binding of zinc finger is found to be distinct from many other dna-binding proteins that bind dna through the 2-fold symmetry of the double helix, instead zinc fingers are linked linearly in tandem to bind nucleic acid sequences of varying lengths.  zinc fingers often bind to a sequence of dna known as the gc box. the modular nature of the zinc finger motif allows for a large number of combinations of dna and rna sequences to be bound with high degree of affinity and specificity, and is therefore ideally suited for engineering protein that can be targeted to and bind specific dna sequences. in 1994, it was shown that an artificially-constructed three-finger protein can block the expression of an oncogene in a mouse cell line. zinc fingers fused to various other effector domains, some with therapeutic significance, have since been constructed.


== domain ==
zinc finger (znf) domains are relatively small protein motifs that contain multiple finger-like protrusions that make tandem contacts with their target molecule. some of these domains bind zinc, but many do not, instead binding other metals such as iron, or no metal at all. for example, some family members form salt bridges to stabilise the finger-like folds. they were first identified as a dna-binding motif in transcription factor tfiiia from xenopus laevis (african clawed frog), however they are now recognised to bind dna, rna, protein, and/or lipid substrates. their binding properties depend on the amino acid sequence of the finger domains and on the linker between fingers, as well as on the higher-order structures and the number of fingers. znf domains are often found in clusters, where fingers can have different binding specificities. znf motifs occur in several unrelated protein superfamilies, varying in both sequence and structure. they display considerable versatility in binding modes, even between members of the same class (e.g., some bind dna, others protein), suggesting that znf motifs are stable scaffolds that have evolved specialised functions. for example, znf-containing proteins function in gene transcription, translation, mrna trafficking, cytoskeleton organization, epithelial development, cell adhesion, protein folding, chromatin remodeling, and zinc sensing, to name but a few. zinc-binding motifs are stable structures, and they rarely undergo conformational changes upon binding their target.


== classes ==
initially, the term zinc finger was used solely to describe dna-binding motif found in xenopus laevis; however, it is now used to refer to any number of structures related by their coordination of a zinc ion. in general, zinc fingers coordinate zinc ions with a combination of cysteine and histidine residues. originally, the number and order of these residues was used to classify different types of zinc fingers ( e.g., cys2his2, cys4, and cys6). more recently, a more systematic method has been used to classify zinc finger proteins instead. this method classifies zinc finger proteins into ""fold groups"" based on the overall shape of the protein backbone in the folded domain.  the most common ""fold groups"" of zinc fingers are the cys2his2-like (the ""classic zinc finger""), treble clef, and zinc ribbon.the following table shows the different structures and their key features:


=== cys2his2 ===
the cys2his2-like fold group (c2h2) is by far the best-characterized class of zinc fingers, and is common in mammalian transcription factors. such domains adopt a simple ββα fold and have the amino acid sequence motif:
x2-cys-x2,4-cys-x12-his-x3,4,5-histhis class of zinc fingers can have a variety of functions such as binding rna and mediating protein-protein interactions, but is best known for its role in sequence-specific dna-binding proteins such as zif268 (egr1).  in such proteins, individual zinc finger domains typically occur as tandem repeats with two, three, or more fingers comprising the dna-binding domain of the protein.  these tandem arrays can bind in the major groove of dna and are typically spaced at 3-bp intervals.  the α-helix of each domain (often called the ""recognition helix"") can make sequence-specific contacts to dna bases; residues from a single recognition helix can contact four or more bases to yield an overlapping pattern of contacts with adjacent zinc fingers.


=== gag-knuckle ===
this fold group is defined by two short β-strands connected by a turn (zinc knuckle) followed by a short helix or loop and resembles the classical cys2his2 motif with a large portion of the helix and β-hairpin truncated.
the retroviral nucleocapsid (nc) protein from hiv and other related retroviruses are examples of proteins possessing these motifs. the gag-knuckle zinc finger in the hiv nc protein is the target of a class of drugs known as zinc finger inhibitors.


=== treble-clef ===
the treble-clef motif consists of a β-hairpin at the n-terminus and an α-helix at the c-terminus that each contribute two ligands for zinc binding, although a loop and a second β-hairpin of varying length and conformation can be present between the n-terminal β-hairpin and the c-terminal α-helix.  these fingers are present in a diverse group of proteins that frequently do not share sequence or functional similarity with each other.  the best-characterized proteins containing treble-clef zinc fingers are the nuclear hormone receptors.


=== zinc ribbon ===
the zinc ribbon fold is characterised by two beta-hairpins forming two structurally similar zinc-binding sub-sites.


=== zn2/cys6 ===
the canonical members of this class contain a binuclear zinc cluster in which two zinc ions are bound by six cysteine residues. these zinc fingers can be found in several transcription factors including the yeast gal4 protein.


=== miscellaneous ===
the zinc finger antiviral protein (zap) binds to the cpg site. it is used in mammals for antiviral defense.


== applications ==
various protein engineering techniques can be used to alter the dna-binding specificity of zinc fingers and tandem repeats of such engineered zinc fingers can be used to target desired genomic dna sequences.  fusing a second protein domain such as a transcriptional activator or repressor to an array of engineered zinc fingers that bind near the promoter of a given gene can be used to alter the transcription of that gene. fusions between engineered zinc finger arrays and protein domains that cleave or otherwise modify dna can also be used to target those activities to desired genomic loci.  the most common applications for engineered zinc finger arrays include zinc finger transcription factors and zinc finger nucleases, but other applications have also been described. typical engineered zinc finger arrays have between 3 and 6 individual zinc finger motifs and bind target sites ranging from 9 basepairs to 18 basepairs in length.  arrays with 6 zinc finger motifs are particularly attractive because they bind a target site that is long enough to have a good chance of being unique in a mammalian genome.


=== zinc finger nucleases ===
engineered zinc finger arrays are often fused to a dna cleavage domain (usually the cleavage domain of foki) to generate zinc finger nucleases.  such zinc finger-foki fusions have become useful reagents for manipulating genomes of many higher organisms including drosophila melanogaster, caenorhabditis elegans, tobacco, corn, zebrafish, various types of mammalian cells, and rats. targeting a double-strand break to a desired genomic locus can be used to introduce frame-shift mutations into the coding sequence of a gene due to the error-prone nature of the non-homologous dna repair pathway.  if a homologous dna ""donor sequence"" is also used then the genomic locus can be converted to a defined sequence via the homology directed repair pathway.  an ongoing clinical trial is evaluating zinc finger nucleases that disrupt the ccr5 gene in cd4+ human t-cells as a potential treatment for hiv/aids.


=== methods of engineering zinc finger arrays ===
the majority of engineered zinc finger arrays are based on the zinc finger domain of the murine transcription factor zif268, although some groups have used zinc finger arrays based on the human transcription factor sp1.  zif268 has three individual zinc finger motifs that collectively bind a 9 bp sequence with high affinity. the structure of this protein bound to dna was solved in 1991 and stimulated a great deal of research into engineered zinc finger arrays.  in 1994 and 1995, a number of groups used phage display to alter the specificity of a single zinc finger of zif268. there are two main methods currently used to generate engineered zinc finger arrays, modular assembly, and a bacterial selection system, and there is some debate about which method is best suited for most applications.the most straightforward method to generate new zinc finger arrays is to combine smaller zinc finger ""modules"" of known specificity. the structure of the zinc finger protein zif268 bound to dna described by pavletich and pabo in their 1991 publication has been key to much of this work and describes the concept of obtaining fingers for each of the 64 possible base pair triplets and then mixing and matching these fingers to design proteins with any desired sequence specificity.
the most common modular assembly process involves combining separate zinc fingers that can each recognize a 3-basepair dna sequence to generate 3-finger, 4-, 5-, or 6-finger arrays that recognize target sites ranging from 9 basepairs to 18 basepairs in length.  another method uses 2-finger modules to generate zinc finger arrays with up to six individual zinc fingers. the barbas laboratory of the scripps research institute used phage display to develop and characterize zinc finger domains that recognize most dna triplet sequences while another group isolated and characterized individual fingers from the human genome. a potential drawback with modular assembly in general is that specificities of individual zinc finger can overlap and can depend on the context of the surrounding zinc fingers and dna. a recent study demonstrated that a high proportion of 3-finger zinc finger arrays generated by modular assembly fail to bind their intended target with sufficient affinity in a bacterial two-hybrid assay and fail to function as zinc finger nucleases, but the success rate was somewhat higher when sites of the form gnngnngnn were targeted.a subsequent study used modular assembly to generate zinc finger nucleases with both 3-finger arrays and 4-finger arrays and observed a much higher success rate with 4-finger arrays.  a variant of modular assembly that takes the context of neighboring fingers into account has also been reported and this method tends to yield proteins with improved performance relative to standard modular assembly.numerous selection methods have been used to generate zinc finger arrays capable of targeting desired sequences.  initial selection efforts utilized phage display to select proteins that bound a given dna target from a large pool of partially randomized zinc finger arrays.  this technique is difficult to use on more than a single zinc finger at a time, so a multi-step process that generated a completely optimized 3-finger array by adding and optimizing a single zinc finger at a time was developed. more recent efforts have utilized yeast one-hybrid systems, bacterial one-hybrid and two-hybrid systems, and mammalian cells.  a promising new method to select novel 3-finger zinc finger arrays utilizes a bacterial two-hybrid system and has been dubbed ""open"" by its creators.  this system combines pre-selected pools of individual zinc fingers that were each selected to bind a given triplet and then utilizes a second round of selection to obtain 3-finger arrays capable of binding a desired 9-bp sequence.  this system was developed by the zinc finger consortium as an alternative to commercial sources of engineered zinc finger arrays. it is somewhat difficult to directly compare the binding properties of proteins generated with this method to proteins generated by modular assembly as the specificity profiles of proteins generated by the open method have never been reported.

uncharacterized protein c4orf19 homolog (mouse),protein,"uncharacterized protein c15orf32 is a protein which in humans is encoded by the c15orf32 gene and is located on chromosome 15, location 15q26.1. variants of c15orf32 have been linked to bipolar disorder, alcohol abuse, and acute myeloid leukemia.


== gene ==
c15orf32, which stands for chromosome 15 open reading frame 32, is a gene on the plus strand of chromosome 15, on the cytogenetic band 15q26.1. c15orf32 is 29,464 bases long; on genome reference consortium human build 38, it spans bases 92,471,654-92,501,117. it contains 3 exons.


== transcripts ==
two isoforms of c15orf32 exist. the longer transcript, known as transcript variant 2 on ncbi, is 1,764 bases long. the other is transcript 1 and is 1,726 bases long.


== proteins ==
the transcript variant 2 of the c15orf32 gene encodes a 178 amino acid protein and has a molecular mass of 20,262 da. its basal isoelectric point is 9.34. transcript variant 1 is missing amino acids 166-178. there is significantly large spacing between the glutamic acid residues at locations 12 and 23.


=== structure ===

a transmembrane segment is predicted between amino acids 51 and 71 by phobius and amino acids 57 and 71 by saps. the n-terminus is predicted to be outside of the cytoplasm, and the c-terminus within the cytoplasm. the chou-fasman algorithm predicts a beta sheet in this region, as well as much of region between amino acids 114 and 147. i-tasser was used to predict the tertiary structure. the top model predicted eight alpha helices, including one between amino acids 51 and 71 concurrent with the transmembrane segment predicted earlier, although this structure had low confidence.


== regulation ==


=== gene level ===
the promoter region of c15orf32 is predicted to span base pairs 92,470,677-92,471,777 according to gene2promoter tool by genomatix. the most commonly predicted transcription factor families by the matinspector tool from genomatix within this promoter region were sox, nuclear receptor subfamily 2, and retinoid x receptor. transcription factor binding sites that have been determined experimentally include stat1, mafk, and jund and are located within the second intron. c15orf32 is expressed most notably in testes, brain, heart, and early in the development of fetuses, although expression is very low. exposure to some compounds such as bromelain, bortezomib, estrogen, and 4-hydroxytamoxifen lead to increase in c15orf32 expression in breast cancer cells.


=== transcript level ===
possible secondary structures of the 5' and 3' untranslated region in c15orf32 mrna is given to the left and was predicted by mfold. it is mostly linear, with a number of small stem-loops. according to targetscan, sites targeted by mirna families mir-193a-5p and mir-365-3p within the 3' utr are broadly conserved among vertebrates.


=== protein level ===
immunohistochemical staining shows that c15orf32 is localized within cells to the cytoplasm and membranes, including the nucleus. both psortii and deeploc strongly predict localization to the nucleus. thr41 has been shown to be phosphorylated post-translation 26 other potential phosphorylation sites were predicted using netphos, with the most likely phosphorylation sites being 6s by pkc, 32t by pkg, 83t by pkc, 89s by pkc, and 162s by pka. a sumoylation site is predicted at amino acids 107-110. 11 mucin type galnac o-glycosylation were predicted using netoglyc, 9 of which occurred in the first 50 base pairs.


== interactions ==
experimental evidence shows potential interaction between c15orf32 and pkd2, alg9, disp1, npc1, fzd2, fam69a, atp6v1g2, asic1, dpy19l4, sppl2b, and hgsnat.


== clinical significance ==
variants of c15orf32 has been linked to several traits through genome wide association studies. the rs8040009 snp in the 3’ utr had a strong association with bipolar i disorder in a population of han chinese. three snps within c15orf32, including rs1455773 in exon 1 which causes a missense mutation from alanine to threonine at position 17, were also associated with bipolar disorder in an australian cohort. this snp was also linked to alcohol use disorder and heaviness of drinking. the rs1455774 snp, located in the 5’ utr, is located within the target sites of mirna hsa-mir-539 and hsa-let-7i* which affects the expression of these mirnas, which may increase breast cancer susceptibility. the rs11635085 snp was linked to increased antibody igg levels after exposure to casein, a dietary antigen, in mexican americans. the rs1455782 snp was linked to decreased forced vital capacity, which is a measure of pulmonary function. the rs12148722 snp was mildly associated with velopharyngeal dysfunction. a haplotype block within c15orf32 was associated with acute myeloid leukemia. a deletion in 15q26.1 including genes st8sia2, c15orf32, and fam174b was found in a patient with epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder.


== homology ==
homologs of c15orf32 have been described in 39 other mammals. no known orthologs exist outside of mammals.

manganese(ii) sulfate hexahydrate,reagent,"manganese(ii) sulfate  usually refers to the inorganic compound with the formula mnso4·h2o.  this pale pink deliquescent solid is a commercially significant manganese(ii) salt. approximately 260,000 tonnes of manganese(ii) sulfate were produced worldwide in 2005. it is the precursor to manganese metal and many other chemical compounds.  manganese-deficient soil is remediated with this salt.


== structure ==

the structure of mnso4·h2o has been determined by x-ray crystallography. like many metal sulfates, manganese sulfate forms a variety of hydrates: monohydrate, tetrahydrate, pentahydrate, and heptahydrate.  all of these salts dissolve in water to give faintly pink solutions of the aquo complex [mn(h2o)6]2+.


== applications and production ==
typically, manganese ores are purified by their conversion to manganese(ii) sulfate.  treatment of aqueous solutions of the sulfate with sodium carbonate leads to precipitation of manganese carbonate, which can be calcined to give the oxides mnox.  in the laboratory, manganese sulfate can be made by treating manganese dioxide with sulfur dioxide:
mno2  +  so2 + h2o  →  mnso4(h2o)it can also be made by mixing potassium permanganate with sodium bisulfate and hydrogen peroxide.
manganese sulfate is a by-product of various industrially significant oxidations that use manganese dioxide, including the manufacture of hydroquinone and anisaldehyde.electrolysis of manganese sulfate yields manganese dioxide, which is called emd for electrolytic manganese dioxide.  alternatively oxidation of manganese sulfate with potassium permanganate yields the so-called chemical manganese dioxide (cmd).  these materials, especially emd, are used in dry-cell batteries.


== natural occurrence ==
manganese(ii) sulfate minerals are very rare in nature and always occur as hydrates. the monohydrate is called szmikite; tetrahydrate = ilesite; hexahydrate (the most rare) = chvaleticeite; pentahydrate = jōkokuite; heptahydrate = mallardite.

butylated hydroxytoluene crystals,drug,"cresols (also hydroxytoluene) are organic compounds which are methylphenols. they are a widely occurring natural and manufactured group of aromatic organic compounds, which are categorized as phenols (sometimes called phenolics). depending on the temperature, cresols can be solid or liquid because they have melting points not far from room temperature.  like other types of phenols, they are slowly oxidized by long exposure to air, and the impurities often give samples of cresols a yellowish to brownish red tint. cresols have an odor characteristic to that of other simple phenols, reminiscent to some of a ""coal tar"" smell. the name cresol reflects their structure, being phenols, and their traditional source, creosote.


== structure and production ==
in its chemical structure, a molecule of cresol has a methyl group substituted onto the ring of phenol. there are three forms (isomers) of cresol: ortho-cresol (o-cresol), meta-cresol (m-cresol), and para-cresol (p-cresol). these forms occur separately or as a mixture, which can also be called cresol or more specifically, tricresol. about half of the world's supply of cresols are extracted from coal tar. the rest is produced by hydrolysis of chlorotoluenes or the related sulfonates.  another method entails methylation of phenol with methanol over a solid acid catalyst, often comprising magnesium oxide or alumina. temperatures above 300 °c are typical. anisole converts to cresols under these conditions.


== applications ==
cresols are precursors or synthetic intermediates to other compounds and materials, including plastics, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and dyes.for cresol bactericides or disinfectants the mechanism of action is due to the destruction of bacterial cell membranes.most recently, cresols have been used to create a breakthrough in manufacturing carbon nanotubes at scale that are separated and not twisted, without additional chemicals that change the surface properties of the nanotubes.

== health effects ==
when cresols are inhaled, ingested, or applied to the skin, they can be very harmful. effects observed in people include irritation and burning of skin, eyes, mouth, and throat; abdominal pain and vomiting; heart damage; anemia; liver and kidney damage; facial paralysis; coma; and death.
breathing high levels of cresols for a short time results in irritation of the nose and throat. aside from these effects, very little is known about the effects of breathing cresols, for example, at lower levels over longer times.
ingesting high levels results in kidney problems, mouth and throat burns, abdominal pain, vomiting, and effects on the blood and nervous system.
skin contact with high levels of cresols can burn the skin and damage the kidneys, liver, blood, brain, and lungs.
short-term and long-term studies with animals have shown similar effects from exposure to cresols. no human or animal studies have shown harmful effects from cresols on reproduction.
it is not known what the effects are from long-term ingestion or skin contact with low levels of cresols.
the occupational safety and health administration has set a permissible exposure limit at 5 ppm (22 mg/m3) over an eight-hour time-weighted average, while the national institute for occupational safety and health  recommends a limit of  2.3 ppm (10 mg/m3).

starter for 10 (film),non_science,"starter for 10 is a 2006 british comedy-drama film directed by tom vaughan from a screenplay by david nicholls, adapted from his 2003 novel starter for ten. the film stars james mcavoy as a university student who wins a place on a university challenge quiz team. it premiered at the toronto international film festival in september 2006, and was released in the uk and ireland on 10 november 2006, and in canada and the us on 23 february 2007.


== plot ==
in 1985, brian jackson is a first-year university student and information sponge. since his working-class childhood in southend-on-sea, brian has loved the tv quiz show university challenge, with its catchphrase, ""your starter for 10"". soon after arriving at bristol university, brian attends a party where he meets left-wing rebecca, with whom he feels an instant connection. brian attempts to join the university challenge team, but narrowly fails to secure a place when he helps another candidate, alice, cheat on the qualifying test. brian falls for the glamorous alice and tries to date her, despite her signals that she sees him as a friend. as term starts, brian is invited to join the team after a member falls ill. the captain, patrick, is a stuck-up post-grad who has remained captain despite never having achieved success on university challenge. brian impresses the team with his trivia knowledge and uses his time to get closer to alice, eventually getting invited to her house for christmas. unfortunately, brian embarrasses himself in front of her family by getting stoned while trying to impress alice. he returns to bristol for the rest of the vacation and meets rebecca again. they again hit it off, but, as they are hooking up, he inadvertently calls her ""alice"", offending her and ruining the moment. following his romantic failures, he talks with spencer, his friend from southend, who admits to being in legal trouble. brian invites spencer to a party before his court appearance.
during the party, patrick insults spencer's upbringing and belittles him. spencer hits patrick in the face and disrupts the event. afterwards, brian shares a drink with rebecca and tries to apologise for his own behaviour. however, rebecca still feels brian loves alice and encourages him to follow his heart and tell alice how he feels. he takes her advice and arrives at alice's flat to declare his love, but discovers spencer there. excited by his violent behaviour at the party, alice had invited him back. brian feels betrayed by them both, since he had told spencer how he felt about alice. brian gets depressed and struggles with concentrating during university challenge practices and his studies, threatening his university place. patrick becomes frustrated with brian, and as they arrive for their university challenge match, berates him for his lack of focus. in response, brian headbutts patrick, but only succeeds in knocking himself unconscious. he is revived backstage by rebecca, who has come to watch the show and gives him encouragement before he is escorted to the set. on the way, brian is briefly left alone with an open envelope containing the quiz questions. he reads one of the cards before putting it back in the envelope, and, inspired by the relative ease of the question, rejoins his team. the match starts off poorly, with nerves clearly getting to patrick as he fails to answer several questions and puts the team in a hole. brian slowly but surely digs them out of it, getting into his swing as he answers question after question. as the match is heating up and brian's team has the momentum, brian inadvertently gives the answer to the question he had previously seen before quizmaster bamber gascoigne has even begun to read it (he has merely introduced it as ""an astronomy question""). realising that brian has seen the cards, gascoigne suspends the match and brian's team is disqualified.
brian returns home and falls into another depression, sleeping all day and ignoring calls. his mother tries to get him out of the house, but the person who finally reaches him is spencer. he tells brian that gascoigne had gone easy on him, and that he is sorry for his behaviour and proud of brian for chasing his dreams. inspired by his friend, brian returns to bristol and meets his tutor, promising he is back for good. he then stands alice up to find rebecca, who is taking part in a political demonstration. he asks her if she could ever forgive him for his mistakes, and if they can start again. she replies that he already knows the answer, and they kiss.


== cast ==


== production ==
despite being set at bristol university, the main quad and gustave tuck lecture theatre of university college london were used as sets. the university of bristol students union building is in fact the university's school of chemistry. the granada tv studios are actually at the back of bbc television centre: the corridor (actually leading to the bbc multi-storey car park) was transformed for a day for the filming in 2005 with the addition of a granada logo and pictures of past stars. the buildings at the end where a demonstration was held in which brian tells rebecca how much he likes her is the queen mary court and king william court at the university of greenwich. brian's home is shown as a slightly run-down seaside house, supposedly located in westcliff-on-sea. these scenes were actually filmed in the small village of jaywick, near clacton-on-sea, with the real westcliff bearing little resemblance to its onscreen depiction. clacton pier was used for the scenes set on the pier at southend-on-sea.


== reception ==
the film received positive reviews, with a 90% rating on rotten tomatoes based on 78 reviews; the site's consensus states: ""starter for 10 is a spirited coming-of-age tale that remains charming and witty even as it veers into darker territory. the unique setting of a quiz show makes the film wittier than your average romantic comedy.""


== soundtrack ==
the soundtrack features music from the cure, the smiths, the psychedelic furs, buzzcocks, yazoo, motörhead, echo & the bunnymen, the undertones, tears for fears, the style council and kate bush, among others. the song ""ace of spades"", which appears at the beginning of the film, was performed by motörhead in the ""bambi"" episode of the young ones, filmed in bristol, that included the university challenge spoof.

mesothelial cell of epicardium,cell,"heart development (also known as cardiogenesis) refers to the prenatal development of the heart. this begins with the formation of two endocardial tubes which merge to form the tubular heart, also called the primitive heart tube. the heart is the first functional organ in vertebrate embryos, and in the human, beats spontaneously by week 4 of development.the tubular heart quickly differentiates into the truncus arteriosus, bulbus cordis, primitive ventricle, primitive atrium, and the sinus venosus. the truncus arteriosus splits into the ascending aorta and the pulmonary trunk. the bulbus cordis forms part of the ventricles. the sinus venosus connects to the fetal circulation.
the heart tube elongates on the right side, looping and becoming the first visual sign of left-right asymmetry of the body. septa form within the atria and ventricles to separate the left and right sides of the heart.


== early development ==
the heart derives from embryonic mesodermal germ layer cells that differentiate after gastrulation into mesothelium, endothelium, and myocardium. mesothelial pericardium forms the outer lining of the heart. the inner lining of the heart – the endocardium, lymphatic and blood vessels, develop from endothelium.


=== endocardial tubes ===
in the splanchnopleuric mesenchyme on either side of the neural plate, a horseshoe-shaped area develops as the cardiogenic region. this has formed from cardiac myoblasts  and blood islands as forerunners of blood cells and vessels. by day 19, an endocardial tube begins to develop in each side of this region. these two tubes grow and by the third week have converged towards each other to merge, using programmed cell death to form a single tube, the tubular heart.from splanchnopleuric mesenchyme, the cardiogenic region develops cranially and laterally to the neural plate. in this area, two separate angiogenic cell clusters form on either side and coalesce to form the endocardial tubes. as embryonic folding continues, the two endocardial tubes are pushed into the thoracic cavity, where they begin to fuse together, and this is completed at about 22 days.at around 18 to 19 days after fertilisation, the heart begins to form. this early development is critical for subsequent embryonic and prenatal development. the heart is the first functional organ to develop and starts to beat and pump blood at around day 22. the heart begins to develop near the head of the embryo in the cardiogenic area. following cell signalling, two strands or cords begin to form in the cardiogenic  region as these form, a lumen develops within them, at which point, they are referred to as endocardial tubes. at the same time that the tubes are forming other major heart components are also being formed. the two tubes migrate together and fuse to form a single primitive heart tube, the tubular heart which quickly forms five distinct regions. from head to tail, these are the truncus arteriosus, bulbus cordis, primitive ventricle, primitive atrium, and the sinus venosus. initially, all venous blood flows into the sinus venosus, and contractions propel the blood from tail to head, or from the sinus venosus to the truncus arteriosus. the truncus arteriosus will divide to form the aorta and pulmonary artery; the bulbus cordis will develop into the right ventricle; the primitive ventricle will form the left ventricle; the primitive atrium will become the front parts of the left and right atria and their appendages, and the sinus venosus will develop into the posterior part of the right atrium, the sinoatrial node and the coronary sinus.


=== heart tube position ===
the central part of cardiogenic area is in front of the oropharyngeal membrane and the neural plate. the growth of the brain and the cephalic folds push the oropharyngeal membrane forward, while the heart and the pericardial cavity move first to the cervical region and then into the chest. the curved portion of the horseshoe-shaped area expands to form the future ventricular infundibulum and the ventricular regions, as the heart tube continues to expand. the tube starts receiving venous drainage in its caudal pole and will pump blood out of the first aortic arch and into the dorsal aorta through its polar head. initially the tube remains attached to the dorsal part of the pericardial cavity by a mesodermal tissue fold called the dorsal mesoderm. this mesoderm disappears to form the two pericardial sinuses the transverse and the oblique pericardial sinuses, which connect both sides of the pericardial cavity.the myocardium thickens and secretes a thick layer of rich extracellular matrix containing hyaluronic acid which separates the endothelium. then mesothelial cells form the pericardium and migrate to form most of the epicardium. then the heart tube is formed by the endocardium, which is the inner endothelial lining of the heart, and the myocardial muscle wall which is the epicardium that covers the outside of the tube.


== heart folding ==
the heart tube continues stretching and by day 23, in a process called morphogenesis, cardiac looping begins. the cephalic portion curves in a frontal clockwise direction. the atrial portion starts moving in a cephalically and then moves to the left from its original position. this curved shape approaches the heart and finishes its growth on day 28. the conduit forms the atrial and ventricular junctions which connect the common atrium and the common ventricle in the early embryo. the arterial bulb forms the trabecular portion of the right ventricle. a cone will form the infundibula blood of both ventricles. the arterial trunk and the roots will form the proximal portion of the aorta and the pulmonary artery. the junction between the ventricle and the arterial bulb will be called the primary intra-ventricular hole. the tube is divided into cardiac regions along its craniocaudal axis:  the primitive ventricle, called primitive left ventricle, and the trabecular proximal arterial bulb, called the primitive right ventricle. this time no septum is present in heart.

in the middle of the fourth week, the sinus venosus receives venous blood from the poles of right and left sinus. each pole receives blood from three major veins: the vitelline vein, the umbilical vein and the common cardinal vein. the sinus opening moves clockwise. this movement is caused mainly by the left to right shunt of blood, which occurs in the venous system during the fourth and fifth week of development.when the left common cardinal vein disappears in the tenth week only the oblique vein of the left atrium and the coronary sinus remain. the right pole joins the right atrium to form the wall portion of the right atrium. the right and left venous valves fuse and form a peak known as the septum spurium. at the beginning, these valves are large, but over time the left venous valve and the septum spurium fuse with the developing atrial septum. the upper right venous valve disappears, while the bottom venous valve evolves into the inferior valve of the vena cava and the coronary sinus valve.


=== heart wall ===
the main walls of the heart are formed between day 27 and 37 of the development of the early embryo. the growth consists of two tissue masses actively growing that approach one another until they merge and split light into two separate conduits.  tissue masses called endocardial cushions develop into atrioventricular and conotroncal regions. in these places, the cushions will help in the formation of auricular septum, ventricular conduits, atrio-ventricular valves and aortic and pulmonary channels.


=== atria ===

at the end of the fourth week, a crest grows that leaves the cephalic part. this crest is the first part of the septum primum. the two ends of the septum extend into the interior of the endocardial cushions in the atrioventricular canal. the opening between the bottom edge of the septum primum and endocardial cushions is the ostium primum (first opening). the extensions of the upper and lower endocardial pads grow along the margin of the septum primum and close the ostium primum. coalescence of these perforations will form the ostium secundum (second opening), which allows blood to flow freely from the right atrium to the left.
when the right of the atrium expands due to the incorporation of the pole of the sinus, a new fold appears, called the septum secundum. at its right side it is fused with the left venous valve and the septum spurium. a free opening will then appear, called  the foramen ovale. the remains of the upper septum primum, will become the valves of the foramen ovale. the passage between the two atrial chambers consists of a long oblique slit through which blood flows from the right atrium to the left.


=== ventricles ===
initially, a single pulmonary vein develops in the form of a bulge in the back wall of the left atrium. this vein will connect with the veins of the developing lung buds. as development proceeds the pulmonary vein and its branches are incorporated into the left atrium and they both form the smooth wall of the atrium. the embryonic left atrium remains as the trabecular left atrial appendage, and the embryonic right atrium remains as the right atrial appendage.


=== septum formation of the atrioventricular canal ===
at the end of the fourth week, two atrioventricular endocardial cushions appear. initially the atrioventricular canal gives access to the primitive left ventricle, and is separated from arterial bulb by the edge of the ventricular bulb. in the fifth week, the posterior end terminates in the center part of the upper endocardial cushion. because of this, blood can access both the left primitive ventricle and the right primitive ventricle. as the anterior and posterior pads project inwardly, they merge to form a right and left atrioventricular orifice.


=== atrioventricular valves ===
when forming intra-atrial septa, atrio-ventricular valves will begin to grow. a muscular interventricular septum begins to grow from the common ventricle to the atrio-ventricular endocardial cushions. the division begins in the common ventricle where a furrow in the outer surface of the heart will appear the interventricular foramen eventually disappears. this closure is achieved by further growth of the muscular interventricular septum, a contribution of trunk crest-conal tissue and a membranous component.


== valves and outflow tracts ==


=== truncus septum formation and arterial cone ===
the arterial cone is closed by the infundibular cushions. the trunk cones are closed by the forming of an infundibulotroncal septum, which is made from a straight proximal portion and distal spiral portion. then, the narrowest portion of the aorta is in the left and dorsal portion. the distal portion of the aorta is pushed forward to the right. the proximal pulmonary artery is right and ventral, and the distal portion of the pulmonary artery is in the left dorsal portion.


== pacemaker and conduction system ==
the rhythmic electrical depolarization waves that trigger myocardial contraction is myogenic, which means that they begin in the heart muscle spontaneously and are then responsible for transmitting signals from cell to cell. myocytes that were obtained in the primitive heart tube, start beating as they connect together by their walls in a syncytium. myocytes initiate rhythmic electrical activity, before the fusion of the endocardial tubes. the heartbeat begins in the region of the pacemaker which has a spontaneous depolarization time faster than the rest of myocardium.the primitive ventricle acts as initial pacemaker. but this pacemaker activity is actually made by a group of cells that derive from the sinoatrial right venous sinus. these cells form an ovoid  sinoatrial node (san), on the left venous valve. after the development of the san, the superior endocardial cushions begin to form a pacemaker as known as the atrioventricular node. with the development of the san, a band of specialized conducting cells start to form creating the bundle of his that sends a branch to the right ventricle and one to the left ventricle. most conduction pathways originate from the cardiogenic mesoderm but the sinus node may be derived from the neural crest.the human embryonic heart begins beating approximately 21 days after fertilization, or five weeks after the last normal menstrual period (lmp), which is the date normally used to date pregnancy in the medical community.  the electrical depolarizations that trigger cardiac myocytes to contract arise spontaneously within the myocyte itself. the heartbeat is initiated in the pacemaker regions and spreads to the rest of the heart through a conduction pathway. pacemaker cells develop in the primitive atrium and the sinus venosus to form the sinoatrial node and the atrioventricular node respectively. conductive cells develop the bundle of his and carry the depolarization into the lower heart. cardiac activity is visible beginning at approximately 5 weeks of pregnancy.
the human heart begins beating at a rate near the mother’s, about 75-80 beats per minute (bpm). the embryonic heart rate (ehr) then accelerates linearly for the first month of beating, peaking at 165-185 bpm during the early 7th week, (early 9th week after the lmp). this acceleration is approximately 3.3 bpm per day, or about 10 bpm every three days, an increase of 100 bpm in the first month.after peaking at about 9.2 weeks after the lmp, it decelerates to about 150 bpm (+/-25 bpm) during the 15th week after the lmp. after the 15th week the deceleration slows reaching an average rate of about 145 (+/-25 bpm) bpm at term.


== imaging ==

in the first trimester, the heartbeat can be visualized, and the heart rate quantified by obstetric ultrasonography. a study of 32 normal pregnancies showed that a fetal heartbeat was visible at a mean human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) level of 10,000 ui/l (range 8650-12,200). obstetric ultrasonography can also use doppler technique on key vessels such as the umbilical artery to detect abnormal flow.

in later stages of pregnancy, a simple doppler fetal monitor can be used to quantify the fetal heart rate.
during childbirth, the parameter is part of cardiotocography, which is where the fetal heartbeat and uterine contractions are continuously recorded.


=== heart rates ===
starting at week 5 the embryonic heart rate accelerates by 3.3 bpm per day for the next month. before this, the embryo possesses a tubular heart.
the embryonic heart begins to beat at approximately the same rate as the mother's, which is typically 80 to 85 bpm. the approximate fetal heart rate for weeks 5 to 9 (assuming a starting rate of 80):

week 5 starts at 80 and ends at 103 bpm
week 6 starts at 103 and ends at 126 bpm
week 7 starts at 126 and ends at 149 bpm
week 8 starts at 149 and ends at 172 bpm
at week 9 the embryonic heart tends to beat within a range of 155 to 195 bpm.by the end of week 9, the embryonic heart has developed septa and valves, and has all four chambers.
at this point, the fetal heart rate begins to decrease, and generally falls within the range of 120 to 160 bpm by week 12.

egypt–tunisia relations,non_science,"egyptian–tunisian relations is the long, historical and cordial relationship between egypt and tunisia, two north african arab countries.


== antiquity to medieval relations ==
egypt and tunisia were homes of two of the earliest and oldest civilizations in africa, the egyptian civilization and carthaginian civilization. being two ancient countries, trades between carthage and ptolemaic kingdom was extremely abundant, if not say, good and extensive. nonetheless, rivalry existed between two countries, as the egyptians didn't trust the carthaginians and sometimes turned against the carthaginians, making it complicated. this complicated nature between two nations would maintain until the end of antiquity and beginning of medieval eras.war elephants of hannibal were thought to have traced from the egyptians, many took parts on hannibal's failed attempts to conquer rome.both egypt and tunisia were together fallen to various empires later, the roman empire, the arab caliphates and ottoman empire.  the most influential among all were the conquests led by arabs on two countries, in which two nations adopted the arabic language instead of their ancient languages, and the arrival of islam. the influence of islam and arab also caused significant remarks, with some of the oldest ongoing institutions located in two countries, notably al-azhar university in egypt and great mosque of kairouan in tunisia.
with the ottoman conquest, egypt and tunisia were together placed under the turks, but ottoman rule in two diverged by differences. ottoman egypt and ottoman tunisia both functioned as autonomous provinces of the empire, but relationship were remarkedly different. the tunisians, in majority, remained loyal to the ottoman state, and had been one of the earliest regions to support the tanzimat, including abolishment of slavery which was one of the earliest in the world, at 1846, and was even among some of the most liberal parts of the empire; but the egyptians had a number of conflicts with the turks, dating back to the ottoman–mamluk wars, and even later egyptian–ottoman wars; while at the same time, egypt used to support the ottomans in various ottoman wars. this backlash of relations between egypt to the ottoman empire further developed with its own different view that would eventually escalate into 20th century under gamal abdel nasser. overall, tunisia's relations with the ottomans were deemed as good while egypt's relations with the ottomans were mostly complicated.
in late 19th century, both egypt and tunisia fell to the hand of european colonizers, the british empire and france. both were heavily modernized and effectively became some of the most liberal arab countries, but its treatments varied. however, anti-british and anti-french activities in egypt and tunisia were so great that it pushed the british and french to re-decide their positions over its colonies. both countries suffered much at the world war ii, being targeted by nazi germany and fascist italy; and also the turning points of the war started in both nations, notably the north african campaign.


== modern relations ==
with tunisia became independence at 1956, egypt and tunisia established relations thanked for the efforts by habib bourguiba, who used to study in egypt previously. egypt and tunisia maintained cordial relationship, with egypt and tunisia were in common front against israel. however, after anwar sadat signed the egypt–israel peace treaty at 1973, relationship between two soured, though not directly, as tunisia had refrained from engaging against israel unlike egypt prior to sadat. it was not until late 1980s that saw egypt and tunisia restored tie, but tunisia was able to maintain low-key relations with egypt.
in 1985, israel launched operation wooden leg, attacking palestine liberation organization headquarter in tunis, prompted angers from tunisians. egypt was one of these nations to condemn the attack, helped warming relations. after the end of cold war, egypt and tunisia re-approached and became strategic partnership.


=== arab spring ===
the outbreak of the arab spring drew strong support from both tunisians and egyptians alike, since they were the two earliest arab nations to be influenced by the revolution. despite this however, only tunisia was more successful in transforming into democracy; egypt, on the other hand, saw a second change of regime and even more unrest, although it was able to fully avoid civil war unlike syria, yemen, iraq and libya.despite the spring, the two countries remain unsolved over its social issues. radicalization of young people and islamists alike, along with unstable economic conditions, have led to the two countries remaining corrupt even after the spring.


== cooperation ==
in 2019, abdel fattah el-sisi announced strengthening of relations and anti-terrorism with tunisia. previously, two countries also signed 10 cooperation agreements in 2017. it was expected, in 2017, that the trade relationship between two would have a boost.there are educational exchanges between egypt and tunisia in many fronts.

lutetium injection,drug,"lutetium (177lu) oxodotreotide (inn) or 177lu dota-tate, trade name lutathera, is a chelated complex of a radioisotope of the element lutetium with dota-tate, used in peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (prrt). specifically, it is used in the treatment of cancers which express somatostatin receptors.alternatives to 177lu-dotate include yttrium-90 dotatate or dotatoc. the longer range of the beta particles emitted by 90y, which deliver the therapeutic effect, may make it more suitable for large tumors with 177lu reserved for smaller volumesthe u.s. food and drug administration (fda) considers 177lu dotatate to be a first-in-class medication.


== history ==
the european commission approved lutetium (177lu) oxodotreotide (trade name lutathera) ""for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic, progressive, well differentiated (g1 and g2), somatostatin receptor positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (gep-nets) in adults"" in september 2017.177lu dota-tate was approved in the united states for the treatment of sstr positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (gep-nets), including foregut, midgut and hindgut neuroendocrine tumors in adults, in january 2018. this was the first time a radiopharmaceutical had been approved for the treatment of gep-nets in the united states.the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) approved 177lu dotatate based primarily on evidence from one clinical trial, netter-1 of 229 participants with somatostatin-receptor positive midgut gep-nets. enrolled participants had tumors which could not be surgically removed and were worsening while receiving treatment with octreotide.participants were randomly assigned to receive either 177lu dotatate with long-acting octreotide or long-acting octreotide, at a higher dose, alone. 177lu dotatate was injected through the vein and long-acting octreotide was injected in the muscle. both, participants and health care providers knew which treatment was given. the benefit of 177lu dotatate was evaluated by measuring the length of time that tumors did not grow after treatment and compared it to the control group (progression free survival).the fda considered additional data from a second study based on data from 1,214 participants with somatostatin receptor-positive tumors, including gep-nets, who received 177lu dotatate at a single site in the netherlands, erasmus mc. all participants received 177lu dotatate with octreotide. participants and health care providers knew which treatment was given. the benefit of 177lu dotatate was evaluated by measuring if and how much the tumor size changed during treatment (the overall response rate). complete or partial tumor shrinkage was reported in 16 percent of a subset of 360 participants with gep-nets who were evaluated for response by the fda. participants initially enrolled in the study received 177lu dotatate as part of an expanded access program.the application for 177lu dotatate was granted priority review designation and orphan drug designation. the fda granted the approval of lutathera to advanced accelerator applications.


== adverse effects ==
the therapeutic effect of 177lu derives from the ionizing beta radiation it emits, however this can also be harmful to healthy tissue and organs. the kidneys are particularly at risk as they help to remove 177lu dota-tate from the body. to protect them, an amino acid solution (arginine/lysine) is administered by slow infusion, starting before the radioactive administration and normally continuing for several hours afterwards.

teicoplanin,antibiotic,"teicoplanin is an antibiotic used in the prophylaxis and treatment of serious infections caused by gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. it is a semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotic with a spectrum of activity similar to vancomycin. its mechanism of action is to inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis.teicoplanin is marketed by sanofi-aventis under the trade name targocid. other trade names include ticocin marketed by  cipla(india).
oral teicoplanin has been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of pseudomembranous colitis and clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea, with comparable efficacy with vancomycin.its strength is considered to be due to the length of the hydrocarbon chain.


== susceptibility data ==
teicoplanin targets peptidoglycan synthesis making it an effective antimicrobial against gram-positive bacteria including staphylococci and clostridium spp. the following represents mic susceptibility data for a few medically significant pathogens:

clostridium difficile: 0.06 μg/ml - 0.5 μg/ml
staphylococcus aureus: ≤0.06 μg/ml - ≥128 μg/ml
staphylococcus epidermidis: ≤0.06 μg/ml - 32 μg/ml


== chemistry ==
teicoplanin (targocid, marketed by sanofi aventis ltd) is actually a mixture of several compounds, five major (named teicoplanin a2-1 through a2-5) and four minor (named teicoplanin rs-1 through rs-4).
all teicoplanins share a same glycopeptide core, termed teicoplanin a3-1 — a fused ring structure to which two carbohydrates (mannose and n-acetylglucosamine) are attached. the major and minor components also contain a third carbohydrate moiety — β-d-glucosamine — and differ only by the length and conformation of a side-chain attached to it.
the structures of the teicoplanin core and the side-chains that characterize the five major teicoplanin compounds are shown below.

teicoplanin refers to a complex of related natural products isolated from the fermentation broth of a strain of actinoplanes teichomyceticus, consisting of a group of five structures.  these structures possess a common aglycone, or core, consisting of seven amino acids bound by peptide and ether bonds to form a four-ring system.  these five structures differ by the identity of the fatty acyl side-chain attached to the sugar.  the origin of these seven amino acids in the biosynthesis of teicoplanin was studied by 1h and 13c nuclear magnetic resonance. the studies indicate amino acids 4-hpg, 3-cl-tyr, and 3-chloro-β-hydroxytyrosine are derived from tyrosine, and the amino acid 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (3,5-dpg) is derived from acetate. teicoplanin contains 6 non-proteinogenic amino acids and three sugar moieties, n-acyl-β-d-glucosamine, n-acetyl-β-d-glucosamine, and d-mannose.


=== gene cluster ===
the study of the genetic cluster encoding the biosynthesis of teicoplanin identified 49 putative open reading frames (orfs) involved in the compound's biosynthesis, export, resistance, and regulation.  thirty-five of these orfs are similar to those found in other glycopeptide gene clusters. the function of each of these genes is described by  li and co-workers. a summary of the gene layout and purpose is shown below.

the heptapeptide backbone of teicoplanin is assembled by the nonribosomal peptide synthetases (nrpss) teia, teib, teic and teid. together these comprise seven modules, each containing a number of domains, with each module responsible for the incorporation of a single amino acid. modules 1, 4, and 5 activate l-4-hpg as the aminoacyl-amp, modules 2 and 6 activate l-tyr, and modules 3 and 7 activate l-3,5-dpg. the activated amino acids are covalently bound to the nrps as thioesters by a phosphopantetheine cofactor, which is attached to the peptidyl carrier protein (pcp) domain. the enzyme bound amino acids are then joined by amide bonds by the action of the condensation (c) domain. 
the heptapetide of teicoplanin contains 4 d-amino acids, formed by epimerization of the activated l-amino acids. modules 2, 4 and 5 each contain an epimerization (e) domain which catalyzes this change. module 1 does not contain an e domain, and epimerization is proposed to be catalysed by the c domain.  in all, six of the seven total amino acids of the teicoplanin backbone are composed of nonproteinogenic or modified amino acids.  eleven enzymes are coordinatively induced to produce these six required residues. teicoplanin contains two chlorinated positions, 2 (3-cl-tyr) and 6 (3-cl-β-hty). the halogenase tei8* has been acts to catalyze the halogenation of both tyrosine residues.  chlorination occurs at the amino acyl-pcp level during the biosynthesis, prior to phenolic oxidative coupling, with the possibility of tyrosine or β-hydroxytyrosine being the substrate of chlorination. hydroxylation of the tyrosine residue of module 6 also occurs in trans during the assembly of the heptapeptide backbone.


=== modification after heptapeptide backbone formation ===
once the heptapeptide backbone has been formed, the linear enzyme-bound intermediate is cyclized. gene disruption studies indicate cytochrome p450 oxygenases as the enzymes that performs the coupling reactions. the x-domain in the final nrps module is required to recruit the oxygenase enzymes. oxyb forms the first ring by coupling residues 4 and 6, and oxye then couples residues 1 and 3. oxya couples residues 2 and 4, followed by the formation of a c-c bond between residues 5 and 7 by oxyc.  the regioselectivity and atropisomer selectivity of these probable one-electron coupling reactions has been suggested to be due to the folding and orientation requirements of the partially crossed-linked substrates in the enzyme active site.  the coupling reactions are shown below.

specific glycosylation has been shown to occur after the formation of the heptpeptide aglycone. three separate glycosyl transferases are required for the glycosylation of the teicoplanin aglycone.  tei10* catalyses the addition of glcnac to residue 4, followed by deacetylation by tei2*. the acyl chain (produced by the action of tei30* and tei13*) is then added by tei11*. tei1 then adds a second glcnac to the β-hydroxyl group of residue 6, followed by mannosylation of residue 7 catalysed by tei3*.

enhancer of mrna-decapping protein 3 (yeast),protein,"the mrna decapping complex is a protein complex in eukaryotic cells responsible for removal of the 5' cap.  the active enzyme of the decapping complex is the bilobed nudix family enzyme dcp2, which hydrolyzes 5' cap and releases 7mgdp and a 5'-monophosphorylated mrna. this decapped mrna is inhibited for translation and will be degraded by exonucleases. the core decapping complex is conserved in eukaryotes. dcp2 is activated by decapping protein 1 (dcp1) and in higher eukaryotes joined by the scaffold protein vcs. together with many other accessory proteins, the decapping complex assembles in p-bodies in the cytoplasm.


== purpose of the decapping complex ==
mrna needs to be degraded, or else it will keep floating around the cell and create unwanted proteins at random. the mrna 5' cap is specifically designed to keep mrna from being degraded before it can be used, and so needs to be removed so the mrna decay pathway can take care of it.


== decapping mechanism ==
dcp2 is the protein that actually decaps mrna, and the rest of proteins in the complex enhance its function and allow it to hydrolyze the chemical bond attaching the mrna to the 5' cap. the nudix domain in dcp2 hydrolyzes one of the bonds on the triphosphate bridge that hooks the mrna and the 5' cap together, causing the 7-methylguanosine cap to come off and leaving the mrna open to degradation by the exonucleases in the cell.


== structure of the decapping complex ==
both single-celled and multicellular organisms need to decap their mrna to get rid of it, but different organisms have slightly different proteins that carry out this process. there are many proteins that stay the same, but several key differences between the single-celled (yeast) and multicellular (metazoan) decapping complexes.


=== yeast decapping complex ===
in yeast (s. cerevisiae), dcp2 is joined by the decapping activator dcp1, the helicase dhh1, the exonuclease xrn1, nonsense mediated decay factors upf1, upf2, and upf3, the lsm complex, pat1, and various other proteins.  these proteins all localize to cytoplasmic structures called p-bodies.  notably in yeast there are no translation factors or ribosomal proteins inside p-bodies.


=== metazoan decapping complex ===
higher eukaryotes have slightly different members of the decapping complex.  the enzyme dcp2 is still the catalytic subunit which forms a holoenzyme with dcp1, and interacts with auxiliary proteins such as xrn1, upf1, upf2, upf3, the lsm complex, and the dhh1 ortholog ddx6. proteins unique to plants and mammals include the beta propeller protein hedls and the enhancer of decapping edc3.  researchers know how the complex physically associates because of immunoprecipitation, while structural details of each part of the complex have been discovered by using x-ray crystallography in conjunction with protein chrystallization. each of these proteins contribute different things to the decapping complex, as discussed below.


==== dcp2 ====

dcp2, as the main catalyst of the decapping process, relies on a specific pattern of amino acids called a nudix domain to align itself with the 5' cap in order to hydrolyze it. a nudix domain is made by packing two beta sheets between multiple alpha helices, can be various lengths and sizes, and is generally used by proteins to carry out dephosphorylation, getting rid of a phosphate by inserting a water molecule into the bond between the phosphate and the rest of the molecule. in the case of dcp2, it contains multiple glutamic acid side chains that are negatively charged in normal cellular conditions, and these are what allow the protein to manipulate water molecules to hydrolyze the tri-phosphate bridge that connects the 5' end of the mrna to the 7-methylguanosine cap. therefore, the nudix domain is what allows dcp2 to remove the 5' cap, which results in the creation 7mgdp, a 7-methylguanosine with two phosphate groups attached, and a monophosphorylated mrna strand.
before the nudix domain is an n-terminal regulatory domain (nrd), which further helps hydrolyze the 5' mrna cap. after the nudix domain is a c-terminal area called box b, which helps bind dcp2 to rna. with all three of these main motifs, dcp2 is able to find, bind firmly to, and hydrolyzes a 5' mrna cap. it does this either by recognizing a hairpin loop in the rna within 10 base pairs of the cap, which is called a dcp2 binding and decapping element, or by a separate protein recognizing a base pair pattern in the mrna and directly recruiting the dcp2-dcp1 holoenzyme. unfortunately, dcp2 works slowly, and needs a few other proteins to coordinate with it so it can decap mrna in a timely manner.


==== dcp1 ====
dcp1 is a regulatory subunit, it combines with dcp2, creating a holoenzyme that can decap mrna properly. without dcp1, it is actually impossible for dcp2 to decap anything in vivo, and it only works incredibly slowly in vitro, which makes forming this holoenzyme an essential process in decapping.dcp1's secondary structure consists of  seven beta sheets and three alpha helices. which come together to form a v-shaped tertiary structure. the defining features of dcp1 are the evh1 domain and a domain that recognises proline rich sequences (prs) on other proteins. the evh1 domain interacts directly with the earlier mentioned nrd of dcp2, and is currently thought to directly help with the decapping of mrna, though how it does so is unclear. the domain that recognises prs is made of mostly hydrophobic amino acids, and is found within the cleft of the 'v' of the dcp1 structure. it is used to bind to other proteins in the decapping complex to dcp1.


==== pnrc2 ====
pnrc2 attaches to and enhances the effect of dcp1 to encourage decapping, and also recruits upf1 to the decapping complex. it possesses a proline rich sequence that is hydrophobic and sticks strongly to the equally hydrophobic cleft in dcp1, and so dcp1 binds pnrc2's proline-rich region, which then enhances the function of dcp2 even more. current research suggests pnrc2 helps associate dcp2 and dcp1 together, making the dcp2-dcp1 holoenzyme more stable and therefore increasing the effectiveness of dcp2, but the exact details about how it does so are vague. the recruitment of upf1 allows the decapping complex to participate in nonsense-mediated mrna decay, which makes pnrc2 a way for dcp2 to connect with the regulatory pathway in charge of destroying incorrectly transcripted mrna.


==== upf1-3 ====
upf1, upf2, and upf3 are proteins involved in the regulatory pathway of nonsense-mediated mrna decay, and not the actual decapping of mrna. only upf1 attaches directly to the decapping complex, whereas upf2 and upf3 attach to mrna, then attach to upf1 to facilitate the destruction of incorrect mrna. these are activators of the complex, in that they can direct the complex at incorrectly formed mrna, but do not actually help decap the mrna.


==== ddx6 ====
ddx6, an ortholog of dhh1, also enhances the effectiveness of the dcp2-dcp1 holoenzyme while it hydrolyzes the 5' cap. it is proposed that, since it is a helicase, it is involved in reconfiguring the 5' end of the mrna to give dcp2 easier access to the 5' cap, and that it stimulates dcp1 so that it interacts better with dcp2 when attached to the rest of the decapping complex.


==== edc3 ====
edc3 further activates the dcp2-dcp1 holoenzyme and allows it to quickly decap mrna. it possesses an lsm domain at its n-terminus, which interacts with specific amino acid motifs called hlm fragments which are found on the c terminus of dcp1 and allows for edc3 to bind to it. another important part of this protein is the fdf linker, which is a long and unstructured stretch of amino acids that binds with ddx6 and stops it from binding directly with the mrna, allowing it to interact with the proteins in the decapping complex instead. the final domain of note is a yjef-n c-terminus domain which dimerizes with mrna and helps create p-bodies around the location of the decapping complex.p-bodies are essentially stockpiled clumps of decapped or repressed mrna mixed together with mrna degradation factors, such as the decapping complex and the nonsense-mediated mrna decay machinery, so they are important for the eventual destruction of the mrna altered by dcp2. as edc3 creates p-bodies around the decapping complex, it becomes easier for dcp2 to find mrna 5' caps to hydrolyze, increasing the effectiveness of the entire complex.


==== pat1 ====
pat1 is another protein that increases the efficiency of the decapping complex. it has three main domains. one is necessary for decapping mrna, and directly helps the dcp2-dcp1 holoenzyme do so. the other two make it easier for the protein to decap mrna, but are not directly involved in the hydrolysis of the phosphate bond. pat1 has many interactions with the various proteins in the decapping complex, and is known as the 'scaffolding protein' because it brings everything together when it is time to decap something. the n-terminus domain interacts with dxx6 and brings it close so it can activate dcp1, another portion helps create p-bodies along with edc3, and the c-terminus domains attach dcp1–dcp2, the lsm1–7 complex and xrn1 to the complex.


==== xrn1 ====
xrn1 is a 5' to 3' exonuclease that degrades the just-decapped mrna. it targets the 5' monophosphate end of mrna, which is what is left over when dcp2 has hydrolyzed the cap off and taken away the 7-methylguanosine cap, along with two of the three phosphates that attach the cap to the mrna. the current theory is that the structure of xrn1 does not allow a capped mrna to interact with it because the xrn1 is structured in such a way that there is steric hindrance that physically blocks the protein from interacting with any mrna that dcp2 has not already decapped.

quinolone resistance protein (qnr),antibiotic,"plasmid-mediated resistance is the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes which are carried on plasmids. the plasmids can be transferred between bacteria within the same species or between different species via conjugation. plasmids often carry multiple antibiotic resistance genes, contributing to the spread of multidrug-resistance (mdr). antibiotic resistance mediated by mdr plasmids severely limits the treatment options for the infections caused by gram-negative bacteria, especially family enterobacteriaceae. the global spread of mdr plasmids has been enhanced by selective pressure from antibiotic usage in human and veterinary medicine.


== properties of resistance plasmids ==
resistance plasmids by definition carry one or more antibiotic resistance genes. they are frequently accompanied by the genes encoding virulence determinants, specific enzymes or resistance to toxic heavy metals. multiple resistance genes are commonly arranged in the resistance cassettes. the antibiotic resistance genes found on the plasmids confer resistance to most of the antibiotic classes used nowadays, for example, beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides.it is very common for the resistance genes or entire resistance cassettes to be re-arranged on the same plasmid or be moved to a different plasmid or chromosome by means of recombination systems. examples of such systems include integrons and transposons.most of the resistance plasmids are conjugative, meaning that they encode all the needed components for the transfer of the plasmid to other bacterium. other smaller plasmids (usually < 10 kb in size) can be mobilized by a conjugative plasmid (usually > 30 kb) in order to be transferred.


== enterobacteriaceae ==
members of family enterobacteriaceae, for example, escherichia coli or klebsiella pneumoniae pose the biggest threat regarding plasmid-mediated resistance in hospital- and community-acquired infections.


=== beta-lactam resistance ===
both narrow spectrum beta-lactamases (e.g. penicillinases) and extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) are common for resistance plasmids in enterobacteriaceae. often multiple beta-lactamase genes are found on the same plasmid hydrolyzing a wide spectrum of beta-lactam antibiotics.


==== extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) ====
esbl enzymes can hydrolyze all beta-lactam antibiotics, including cephalosporins, except for the carpabepenems. the first clinically observed esbl enzymes were mutated versions of the narrow spectrum beta-lactamases, like tem and shv. other esbl enzymes originate outside of family enterobacteriaceae, but have been spreading as well.in addition, since the plasmids that carry esbl genes also commonly encode resistance determinants for many other antibiotics, esbl strains are often resistant to many non-beta-lactam antibiotics as well, leaving very few options for the treatment.


==== carbapenemases ====
carbapenemases represent type of esbl which are able to hydrolyze carbapenem antibiotics that are considered as the last-resort treatment for esbl-producing bacteria. kpc, ndm-1, vim and oxa-48 carbapenemases have been increasingly reported worldwide as causes of hospital-acquired infections.


=== quinolone resistance ===
quinolone resistance genes are frequently located on the same plasmid as the esbl genes. examples of resistance mechanisms include different qnr proteins, aminoglycose acetyltransferase aac(6')-ib-cr that is able to hydrolyze ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, as well as efflux transporters oqxab and qepa.


=== aminoglycoside resistance ===
aminoglycoside resistance genes are also commonly found together with esbl genes. resistance to aminoglycosides is conferred via numerous aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes and 16s rrna methyltransferases.


== small rnas ==
study investigating physiological effect of phk01 plasmid in host e.coli j53 found that the plasmid reduced bacterial motility and conferred resistance to beta-lactams. the phk01  produced plasmid-encoded  small rnas and mediated expression of host srnas. these srnas were antisense to genes involved in replication, conjugate transfer and plasmid stabilisation : as-repa3 (copa), as-trai, as-fino, as-trag, as-pc02 . the over-expression of one of the plasmid-encoded antisense srnas: as-trai shortened t lalog phase of host growth.

ascorbic acid / menthol oral lozenge,drug,"luden's is an american brand of cough drop that is currently manufactured and sold in the us by prestige brands. company headquarters are in tarrytown, new york. luden's products include blue raspberry, honey lemon, honey licorice, kiwi-strawberry, orange, original menthol, sugar-free wild cherry, watermelon, wild berry, wild cherry, and wild honey cough drops.


== history ==
william h. luden created the luden's brand in 1879.  early products included cough drops and candy.  luden gave samples of his cough drops to railroad workers, giving the product national exposure in an early example of guerrilla marketing.luden's  was acquired in 1928 by food industries of philadelphia, a holding company owned by the dietrich family. during its heyday under dietrich ownership, luden's produced more than 500 varieties of candy in addition to its better-known cough drops and employed more than 1,200 people. in 1967 animator ed seeman and musician frank zappa worked together on a television commercial for luden's cough drops. the commercial won a clio award for zappa's soundtrack. in 1980 the company acquired queen anne candy co., based in hammond, indiana. 
the dietrich family sold luden's inc. to hershey foods corp in 1986, resulting in the termination of 98 salaried and 350 hourly workers. luden's throat drops brand was sold by hershey's to pharmacia in 2001. in 2003, pharmacia was acquired by pfizer. in 2006, pfizer sold its consumer products division, including the luden's line, to johnson & johnson.as of 2008, packages of luden's throat drops displayed the slogan ""trusted luden's care – everyone needs a little tlc"".in november 2009 charlesbank capital partners/blacksmith brands announced that it had completed its acquisition of ludens over-the-counter consumer products brands from mcneil-ppc, inc.in late 2010, prestige brands acquired blacksmith brands.


== ingredients ==
luden's brand throat drops are demulcents (meaning a swelling or irritation reliever) and mild oral anesthetics. the active ingredient in fruit flavors is pectin, a soluble gelatinous polysaccharide found in ripe fruits.  pectin places a coating on the throat to reduce irritation and swelling.  original menthol and the various honey flavors contain menthol, an oral anesthetic and irritant reliever.the drops' inactive ingredients include fd&c blue no. 1, fd&c blue 2, fd&c red 40, ascorbic acid, citric acid, malic acid, sodium acetate, sodium chloride, caramel color, corn syrup, flavors, sodium acetate, soybean oil used as a processing aid, sucrose, and water.

elongation factor 1-beta (dictyostelium discoideum),protein,"the kozak consensus sequence (kozak consensus or kozak sequence) is a nucleic acid motif that functions as the protein translation initiation site in most eukaryotic mrna transcripts. regarded as the optimum sequence for initiating translation in eukaryotes, the sequence is an integral aspect of protein regulation and overall cellular health as well as having implications in human disease.  it ensures that a protein is correctly translated from the genetic message,  mediating ribosome assembly and translation initiation. a wrong start site can result in non-functional proteins.   as it has become more studied, expansions of the nucleotide sequence, bases of importance, and notable exceptions have arisen. the sequence was named after the scientist who discovered it, marilyn kozak.  kozak discovered the sequence through a detailed analysis of dna genomic sequences.the kozak sequence is not to be confused with the ribosomal binding site (rbs), that being either the 5′ cap of a messenger rna or an internal ribosome entry site (ires).


== sequence ==
the kozak sequence was determined by sequencing of 699 vertebrate mrnas and verified by site-directed mutagenesis. while initially limited to a subset of vertebrates (i.e. human, cow, cat, dog, chicken, guinea pig, hamster, mouse, pig, rabbit, sheep, and xenopus), subsequent studies confirmed its conservation in higher eukaryotes generally. the sequence was defined as 5'-(gcc)gccrccaugg-3(iupac nucleobase notation summarized here) where:
the underlined nucleotides indicate the translation start codon, coding for methionine.
upper-case letters indicate highly conserved bases, i.e. the 'augg' sequence is constant or rarely, if ever, changes.
'r'  indicates that a purine (adenine or guanine) is always observed at this position (with adenine being more frequent according to kozak)
a lower-case letter denotes the most common base at a position where the base can nevertheless vary
the sequence in parentheses (gcc) is of uncertain significance.the aug is the initiation codon encoding a methionine amino acid at the n-terminus of the protein.  (rarely, gug is used as an initiation codon, but methionine is still the first amino acid as it is the met-trna in the initiation complex that binds to the mrna). variation within the kozak sequence alters the ""strength"" thereof. kozak sequence strength refers to the favorability of initiation, affecting how much protein is synthesized from a given mrna. the a nucleotide of the ""aug"" is delineated as +1 in mrna sequences with the preceding base being labeled as −1. for a 'strong' consensus, the nucleotides at positions +4 (i.e. g in the consensus) and −3 (i.e. either a or g in the consensus) relative to the +1 nucleotide must both match the consensus (there is no 0 position).   an 'adequate' consensus has only 1 of these sites, while a 'weak' consensus has neither. the cc at −1 and −2 are not as conserved, but contribute to the overall strength. there is also evidence that a g in the -6 position is important in the initiation of translation. while the +4 and the −3 positions in the kozak sequence have the greatest relative importance in the establishing a favorable initiation context a cc or aa motif at −2 and −1 were found to be important in the initiation of translation in tobacco and maize plants. protein synthesis in yeast was found to be highly affect by composition of the kozak sequence in yeast, with adenine enrichment resulting in higher levels of gene expression.  a suboptimal kozak sequence can allow for pic to scan past the first aug site and start initiation at a downstream aug codon.


== ribosome assembly ==
the ribosome assembles on the start codon (aug), located within the kozak sequence. prior to translation initiation, scanning is done by the pre-initiation complex (pic). the pic consists of the 40s (small ribosomal subunit) bound to the  ternary complex, eif2-gtp-intiatormet trna (tc) to form the 43s ribosome. assisted by several other initiation factors (eif1 and eif1a, eif5, eif3, polya binding protein) it is recruited to the 5′ end of the mrna.  eukaryotic mrna is capped with a 7-methylguanosine (m7g) nucleotide which can help recruit the pic to the mrna and initiate scanning.  this recruitment to the m7g 5′ cap is supported by the inability of eukaryotic ribosomes to translate circular mrna, which has no 5′ end.  once the pic binds to the mrna it scans until it reaches the first aug codon in a kozak sequence. this scanning is referred to as the scanning mechanism of initiation.

the scanning mechanism of initiation starts when the pic binds the 5′ end of the mrna.  scanning is stimulated by dhx29 and ddx3/ded1 and eif4 proteins. the dhx29 and ddx3/ded1 are dead-box helicases that help to unwind any secondary mrna structure which could hinder scanning.  the scanning of an mrna continues until the first aug codon on the mrna is reached, this is known as the ""first aug rule"".  while exceptions to the ""first aug rule"" exist, most exceptions take place at a second aug codon that is located 3 to 5 nucleotides downstream from the first aug, or within 10 nucleotides from the 5′ end of the mrna. at the aug codon a methionine trna anticodon is recognized by mrna codon. upon base pairing to the start codon the eif5 in the pic helps to hydrolyze a guanosine triphosphate (gtp) bound to the eif2.  this leads to the a structural rearrangement that commits the pic to binding to the large ribosomal subunit (60s) and forming the ribosomal complex (80s).  once the 80s ribosome complex is formed then the elongation phase of translation starts.
the first start codon closest to the 5′ end of the strand is not always recognized if it is not contained in a kozak-like sequence. lmx1b is an example of a gene with a weak kozak consensus sequence. for initiation of translation from such a site, other features are required in the mrna sequence in order for the ribosome to recognize the initiation codon. exceptions to the first aug rule may occur if it is not contained in a kozak-like sequence. this is called leaky scanning and could be a potential way to control translation through initiation. for initiation of translation from such a site, other features are required in the mrna sequence in order for the ribosome to recognize the initiation codon.
it is believed that the pic is stalled at the kozak sequence by interactions between eif2 and the −3 and +4 nucleotides in the kozak position. this stalling allows the start codon and the corresponding anticodon time to form the correct hydrogen bonding. the kozak consensus sequence is so common that the similarity of the sequence around the aug codon to the kozak sequence is used as a criterion for finding start codons in eukaryotes.


== differences from bacterial initiation ==
the scanning mechanism of initiation, which utilizes the kozak sequence, is found only in eukaryotes and has significant differences from the way bacteria initiate translation.  the biggest difference is the existence of the shine-dalgarno (sd) sequence in mrna for bacteria.  the sd sequence is located near the start codon which is in contrast to the kozak sequence which actually contains the start codon.  the shine dalgarno sequence allows the 16s subunit of the small ribosome subunit to bind to the aug start codon immediately with no need for scanning along the mrna.  this results in a more rigorous selection process for the aug codon than in bacteria.  an example of bacterial start codon promiscuity can be seen in the uses alternate start codons uug and gug for some genes.archaeal transcripts use a mix of sd sequence, kozak sequence, and leaderless initiation. haloarchaea are known to have a variant of the kozak consensus sequence in their hsp70 genes.


== mutations and disease ==
marilyn kozak demonstrated, through systematic study of point mutations, that any mutations to a strong consensus sequence in the −3 position or to the +4 position resulted in highly impaired translation initiation both in vitro and in vivo.

research has shown that a mutation of g—>c in the −6 position of the β-globin gene (β+45; human) disrupted the haematological and biosynthetic phenotype function. this was the first mutation found in the kozak sequence and showed a 30% decrease in translational efficiency. it was found in a family from the southeast italy and they suffered from thalassaemia intermedia.similar observations were made regarding mutations in the position −5 from the start codon, aug. cytosine in this position, as opposed to thymine, showed more efficient translation and increased expression of the platelet adhesion receptor, glycoprotein ibα in humans.mutations to the kozak sequence can also have drastic effects upon human health, in particular the heart disease with the gata4 gene.  the gata4 gene is responsible for gene expression in a wide variety of tissues including the heart.  when the guanosine at the -6 position in the kozak sequence of gata4 is mutated to a cytosine a reduction in gata4 protein levels, which leads atrial septal defect in the heart.the ability of the kozak sequence to start translation can result in novel initiation codons in the typically untranslated region of the 5′ (5′ utr) end of the mrna transcript. when a g to a mutation was observed in this region it resulted in an out of frame and thus protein mutation.  this mutated protein results in campomelic dysplasia. campomelic dysplasia is a developmental disorder that results in skeletal malformations.


== variations in the consensus sequence ==
the kozak consensus has been variously described as:
     65432-+234
(gcc)gccrccaugg (kozak 1987)
       agnnaugn
        annaugg
        accaugg (spotts et al., 1997, mentioned in kozak 2002)

ethylene glycol monophosphate,reagent,"cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cgmp) is a cyclic nucleotide derived from guanosine triphosphate (gtp). cgmp acts as a second messenger much like cyclic amp.  its most likely mechanism of action is activation of intracellular protein kinases in response to the binding of membrane-impermeable peptide hormones to the external cell surface.


== synthesis ==
guanylate cyclase (gc) catalyzes cgmp synthesis.  this enzyme converts gtp to cgmp.  peptide hormones such as the atrial natriuretic factor activate membrane-bound gc, while soluble gc (sgc) is typically activated by nitric oxide to stimulate cgmp synthesis. sgc can be inhibited by odq (1h-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one).


== functions ==
cgmp is a common regulator of ion channel conductance, glycogenolysis, and cellular apoptosis. it also relaxes smooth muscle tissues.  in blood vessels, relaxation of vascular smooth muscles lead to vasodilation and increased blood flow.
cgmp is a secondary messenger in phototransduction in the eye. in the photoreceptors of the mammalian eye, the presence of light activates phosphodiesterase, which degrades cgmp. the sodium ion channels in photoreceptors are cgmp-gated, so degradation of cgmp causes sodium channels to close, which leads to the hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor's plasma membrane and ultimately to visual information being sent to the brain.cgmp is also seen to mediate the switching on of the attraction of apical dendrites of pyramidal cells in cortical layer v towards semaphorin-3a (sema3a). whereas the axons of pyramidal cells are repelled by sema3a, the apical dendrites are attracted to it. the attraction is mediated by the increased levels of soluble guanylate cyclase (sgc) that are present in the apical dendrites. sgc generates cgmp, leading to a sequence of chemical activations that result in the attraction towards sema3a. the absence of sgc in the axon causes the repulsion from sema3a. this strategy ensures the structural polarization of pyramidal neurons and takes place in embryonic development.
cgmp, like camp, gets synthesized when olfactory receptors receive odorous input.  cgmp is produced slowly and has a more sustained life than camp, which has implicated it in long-term cellular responses to odor stimulation, such as long-term potentiation.  cgmp in the olfactory is synthesized by both membrane guanylyl cyclase (mgc) as well as soluble guanylyl cyclase (sgc).  studies have found that cgmp synthesis in the olfactory is due to sgc activation by nitric oxide, a neurotransmitter. cgmp also requires increased intracellular levels of camp and the link between the two second messengers appears to be due to rising intracellular calcium levels.


== degradation ==
numerous cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (pde) can degrade cgmp by hydrolyzing cgmp into 5'-gmp. pde 5, -6 and -9 are cgmp-specific while pde1, -2, -3, -10 and -11 can hydrolyse both camp and cgmp.
phosphodiesterase inhibitors prevent the degradation of cgmp, thereby enhancing and/or prolonging its effects. for example, sildenafil (viagra) and similar drugs enhance the vasodilatory effects of cgmp within the corpus cavernosum by inhibiting pde 5 (or pde v). this is used as a treatment for erectile dysfunction. however, the drug can inhibit pde6 in retina (albeit with less affinity than pde5). this has been shown to result in loss of visual sensitivity but is unlikely to impair common visual tasks, except under conditions of reduced visibility when objects are already near visual threshold. this effect is largely avoided by other pde5 inhibitors, such as tadalafil.


== protein kinase activation ==
cgmp is involved in the regulation of some protein-dependent kinases. for example, pkg (protein kinase g) is a dimer consisting of one catalytic and one regulatory unit, with the regulatory units blocking the active sites of the catalytic units.
cgmp binds to sites on the regulatory units of pkg and activates the catalytic units, enabling them to phosphorylate their substrates. unlike with the activation of some other protein kinases, notably pka, the pkg is activated but the catalytic and regulatory units do not disassociate.

chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat),antibiotic,"chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (or cat) is a bacterial enzyme (ec 2.3.1.28) that detoxifies the antibiotic chloramphenicol and is responsible for chloramphenicol resistance in bacteria. this enzyme covalently attaches an acetyl group from acetyl-coa to chloramphenicol, which prevents chloramphenicol from binding to ribosomes. a histidine residue, located in the c-terminal section of the enzyme, plays a central role in its catalytic mechanism.
the crystal structure of the type iii enzyme from escherichia coli with chloramphenicol bound has been determined. cat is a trimer of identical subunits (monomer mr 25,000) and the trimeric structure is stabilised by a number of hydrogen bonds, some of which result in the extension of a beta-sheet across the subunit interface. chloramphenicol binds in a deep pocket located at the boundary between adjacent subunits of the trimer, such that the majority of residues forming the binding pocket belong to one subunit while the catalytically essential histidine belongs to the adjacent subunit. his195 is appropriately positioned to act as a general base catalyst in the reaction, and the required tautomeric stabilisation is provided by an unusual interaction with a main-chain carbonyl oxygen.


== application ==
cat is used as a reporter system to measure the level of a promoter or its tissue-specific expression. the cat assay involves monitoring acetylation of radioactively labeled chloramphenicol on a tlc plate; cat activity is determined by looking for the acetylated forms of chloramphenicol, which have a significantly increased migration rate as compared to the unacetylated form.

sympathetic noradrenergic neuron,cell,"the autonomic nervous system (ans), formerly the vegetative nervous system, is a division of the peripheral nervous system that supplies smooth muscle and glands, and thus influences the function of internal organs. the autonomic nervous system is a control system that acts largely unconsciously and regulates bodily functions, such as the heart rate, digestion, respiratory rate, pupillary response, urination, and sexual arousal. this system is the primary mechanism in control of the fight-or-flight response.
the autonomic nervous system is regulated by integrated reflexes through the brainstem to the spinal cord and organs. autonomic functions include control of respiration, cardiac regulation (the cardiac control center), vasomotor activity (the vasomotor center), and certain reflex actions such as coughing, sneezing, swallowing and vomiting. those are then subdivided into other areas and are also linked to autonomic subsystems and the peripheral nervous system. the hypothalamus, just above the brain stem, acts as an integrator for autonomic functions, receiving autonomic regulatory input from the limbic system.the autonomic nervous system has three branches: the sympathetic nervous system, the parasympathetic nervous system and the enteric nervous system. some textbooks do not include the enteric nervous system as part of this system. the sympathetic nervous system is often considered the ""fight or flight"" system, while the parasympathetic nervous system is often considered the ""rest and digest"" or ""feed and breed"" system. in many cases, both of these systems have ""opposite"" actions where one system activates a physiological response and the other inhibits it. an older simplification of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems as ""excitatory"" and ""inhibitory"" was overturned due to the many exceptions found. a more modern characterization is that the sympathetic nervous system is a ""quick response mobilizing system"" and the parasympathetic is a ""more slowly activated dampening system"", but even this has exceptions, such as in sexual arousal and orgasm, wherein both play a role.there are inhibitory and excitatory synapses between neurons. relatively recently, a third subsystem of neurons that have been named non-noradrenergic, non-cholinergic transmitters  (because they use nitric oxide as a neurotransmitter) have been described and found to be integral in autonomic function, in particular in the gut and the lungs.although the ans is also known as the visceral nervous system, the ans is only connected with the motor side. most autonomous functions are involuntary but they can often work in conjunction with the somatic nervous system which provides voluntary control.


== structure ==

the autonomic nervous system is divided into the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system. the sympathetic division emerges from the spinal cord in the thoracic and lumbar areas, terminating around l2-3. the parasympathetic division has craniosacral “outflow”, meaning that the neurons begin at the cranial nerves (specifically the oculomotor nerve, facial nerve, glossopharyngeal nerve and vagus nerve) and sacral (s2-s4) spinal cord.
the autonomic nervous system is unique in that it requires a sequential two-neuron efferent pathway; the preganglionic neuron must first synapse onto a postganglionic neuron before innervating the target organ. the preganglionic, or first, neuron will begin at the “outflow” and will synapse at the postganglionic, or second, neuron's cell body. the postganglionic neuron will then synapse at the target organ.


=== sympathetic division ===

the sympathetic nervous system consists of cells with bodies in the lateral grey column from t1 to l2/3. these cell bodies are ""gve"" (general visceral efferent) neurons and are the preganglionic neurons. there are several locations upon which preganglionic neurons can synapse for their postganglionic neurons:

paravertebral ganglia (3) of the sympathetic chain (these run on either side of the vertebral bodies)cervical ganglia (3)
thoracic ganglia (12) and rostral lumbar ganglia (2 or 3)
caudal lumbar ganglia and sacral gangliaprevertebral ganglia (celiac ganglion, aorticorenal ganglion, superior mesenteric ganglion, inferior mesenteric ganglion)
chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla (this is the one exception to the two-neuron pathway rule: the synapse is directly efferent onto the target cell bodies)these ganglia provide the postganglionic neurons from which innervation of target organs follows. examples of splanchnic (visceral) nerves are:

cervical cardiac nerves and thoracic visceral nerves, which synapse in the sympathetic chain
thoracic splanchnic nerves (greater, lesser, least), which synapse in the prevertebral ganglia
lumbar splanchnic nerves, which synapse in the prevertebral ganglia
sacral splanchnic nerves, which synapse in the inferior hypogastric plexusthese all contain afferent (sensory) nerves as well, known as gva (general visceral afferent) neurons.


=== parasympathetic division ===

the parasympathetic nervous system consists of cells with bodies in one of two locations: the brainstem (cranial nerves iii, vii, ix, x) or the sacral spinal cord (s2, s3, s4).  these are the preganglionic neurons, which synapse with postganglionic neurons in these locations:

parasympathetic ganglia of the head: ciliary (cranial nerve iii), submandibular (cranial nerve vii), pterygopalatine (cranial nerve vii), and otic (cranial nerve ix)
in or near the wall of an organ innervated by the vagus (cranial nerve x) or sacral nerves (s2, s3, s4)these ganglia provide the postganglionic neurons from which innervations of target organs follows. examples are:

the postganglionic parasympathetic splanchnic (visceral) nerves
the vagus nerve, which passes through the thorax and abdominal regions innervating, among other organs, the heart, lungs, liver and stomach


=== sensory neurons ===

the sensory arm is composed of primary visceral sensory neurons found in the peripheral nervous system (pns), in cranial sensory ganglia: the geniculate, petrosal and nodose ganglia, appended respectively to cranial nerves vii, ix and x. these sensory neurons monitor the levels of carbon dioxide, oxygen and sugar in the blood, arterial pressure and the chemical composition of the stomach and gut content. they also convey the sense of taste and smell, which, unlike most functions of the ans, is a conscious perception. blood oxygen and carbon dioxide are in fact directly sensed by the carotid body, a small collection of chemosensors at the bifurcation of the carotid artery, innervated by the petrosal (ixth) ganglion.
primary sensory neurons project (synapse) onto “second order” visceral sensory neurons located in the medulla oblongata, forming the nucleus of the solitary tract (nts), that integrates all visceral information. the nts also receives input from a nearby chemosensory center, the area postrema, that detects toxins in the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid and is essential for chemically induced vomiting or conditional taste aversion (the memory that ensures that an animal that has been poisoned by a food never touches it again). all this visceral sensory information constantly and unconsciously modulates the activity of the motor neurons of the ans.


=== innervation ===
autonomic nerves travel to organs throughout the body. most organs receive parasympathetic supply by the vagus nerve and sympathetic supply by splanchnic nerves. the sensory part of the latter reaches the spinal column at certain spinal segments. pain in any internal organ is perceived as referred pain, more specifically as pain from the dermatome corresponding to the spinal segment.


=== motor neurons ===

motor neurons of the autonomic nervous system are found in ‘’autonomic ganglia’’. those of the parasympathetic branch are located close to the target organ whilst the ganglia of the sympathetic branch are located close to the spinal cord.
the sympathetic ganglia here, are found in two chains: the pre-vertebral and pre-aortic chains. the activity of autonomic ganglionic neurons is modulated by “preganglionic neurons” located in the central nervous system. preganglionic sympathetic neurons are located in the spinal cord, at the thorax and upper lumbar levels. preganglionic parasympathetic neurons are found in the medulla oblongata where they form visceral motor nuclei; the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve; the nucleus ambiguus,  the salivatory nuclei, and in the sacral region of the spinal cord.


== function ==

sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions typically function in opposition to each other. but this opposition is better termed complementary in nature rather than antagonistic. for an analogy, one may think of the sympathetic division as the accelerator and the parasympathetic division as the brake. the sympathetic division typically functions in actions requiring quick responses. the parasympathetic division functions with actions that do not require immediate reaction. the sympathetic system is often considered the ""fight or flight"" system, while the parasympathetic system is often considered the ""rest and digest"" or ""feed and breed"" system.
however, many instances of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity cannot be ascribed to ""fight"" or ""rest"" situations. for example, standing up from a reclining or sitting position would entail an unsustainable drop in blood pressure if not for a compensatory increase in the arterial sympathetic tonus. another example is the constant, second-to-second, modulation of heart rate by sympathetic and parasympathetic influences, as a function of the respiratory cycles. in general, these two systems should be seen as permanently modulating vital functions, in usually antagonistic fashion, to achieve homeostasis.  
higher organisms maintain their integrity via homeostasis which relies on negative feedback regulation which, in turn, typically depends on the autonomic nervous system.  some typical actions of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are listed below.


=== sympathetic nervous system ===

promotes a fight-or-flight response, corresponds with arousal and energy generation, and inhibits digestion

diverts blood flow away from the gastro-intestinal (gi) tract and skin via vasoconstriction
blood flow to skeletal muscles and the lungs is enhanced (by as much as 1200% in the case of skeletal muscles)
dilates bronchioles of the lung through circulating epinephrine, which allows for greater alveolar oxygen exchange
increases heart rate and the contractility of cardiac cells (myocytes), thereby providing a mechanism for enhanced blood flow to skeletal muscles
dilates pupils and relaxes the ciliary muscle to the lens, allowing more light to enter the eye and enhances far vision
provides vasodilation for the coronary vessels of the heart
constricts all the intestinal sphincters and the urinary sphincter
inhibits peristalsis
stimulates orgasm


=== parasympathetic nervous system ===

the parasympathetic nervous system has been said to promote a ""rest and digest"" response, promotes calming of the nerves return to regular function, and enhancing digestion. functions of nerves within the parasympathetic nervous system include:
dilating blood vessels leading to the gi tract, increasing the blood flow.
constricting the bronchiolar diameter when the need for oxygen has diminished
dedicated cardiac branches of the vagus and thoracic spinal accessory nerves impart parasympathetic control of the heart (myocardium)
constriction of the pupil and contraction of the ciliary muscles, facilitating accommodation and allowing for closer vision
stimulating salivary gland secretion, and accelerates peristalsis, mediating digestion of food and, indirectly, the absorption of nutrients
sexual. nerves of the peripheral nervous system are involved in the erection of genital tissues via the pelvic splanchnic nerves 2–4. they are also responsible for stimulating sexual arousal.


=== enteric nervous system ===

the enteric nervous system is the intrinsic nervous system of the gastrointestinal system. it has been described as ""the second brain of the human body"". its functions include:

sensing chemical and mechanical changes in the gut
regulating secretions in the gut
controlling peristalsis and some other movements


=== neurotransmitters ===

at the effector organs, sympathetic ganglionic neurons release noradrenaline (norepinephrine), along with other cotransmitters such as atp, to act on adrenergic receptors, with the exception of the sweat glands and the adrenal medulla:

acetylcholine is the preganglionic neurotransmitter for both divisions of the ans, as well as the postganglionic neurotransmitter of parasympathetic neurons. nerves that release acetylcholine are said to be cholinergic. in the parasympathetic system, ganglionic neurons use acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter to stimulate muscarinic receptors.
at the adrenal medulla, there is no postsynaptic neuron. instead the presynaptic neuron releases acetylcholine to act on nicotinic receptors. stimulation of the adrenal medulla releases adrenaline (epinephrine) into the bloodstream, which acts on adrenoceptors, thereby indirectly mediating or mimicking sympathetic activity.a full table is found at table of neurotransmitter actions in the ans.


== history ==
the specialised system of the autonomic nervous system was recognised by galen. in 1665, willis used the terminology, and in 1900, langley used the term, defining the two divisions as the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.


== caffeine effects ==
caffeine is a bioactive ingredient found in commonly consumed beverages such as coffee, tea, and sodas. short-term physiological effects of caffeine include increased blood pressure and sympathetic nerve outflow. habitual consumption of caffeine may inhibit physiological short-term effects. consumption of caffeinated espresso increases parasympathetic activity in habitual caffeine consumers; however, decaffeinated espresso inhibits parasympathetic activity in habitual caffeine consumers. it is possible that other bioactive ingredients in decaffeinated espresso may also contribute to the inhibition of parasympathetic activity in habitual caffeine consumers.caffeine is capable of increasing work capacity while individuals perform strenuous tasks. in one study, caffeine provoked a greater maximum heart rate while a strenuous task was being performed compared to a placebo. this tendency is likely due to caffeine's ability to increase sympathetic nerve outflow. furthermore, this study found that recovery after intense exercise was slower when caffeine was consumed prior to exercise. this finding is indicative of caffeine's tendency to inhibit parasympathetic activity in non-habitual consumers. the caffeine-stimulated increase in nerve activity is likely to evoke other physiological effects as the body attempts to maintain homeostasis.the effects of caffeine on parasympathetic activity may vary depending on the position of the individual when autonomic responses are measured. one study found that the seated position inhibited autonomic activity after caffeine consumption (75 mg); however, parasympathetic activity increased in the supine position. this finding may explain why some habitual caffeine consumers (75 mg or less) do not experience short-term effects of caffeine if their routine requires many hours in a seated position. it is important to note that the data supporting increased parasympathetic activity in the supine position was derived from an experiment involving participants between the ages of 25 and 30 who were considered healthy and sedentary. caffeine may influence autonomic activity differently for individuals who are more active or elderly.

division of nervous system"
lipid a acyltransferase,antibiotic,"lipid metabolism is the synthesis and degradation of lipids in cells, involving the breakdown or storage of fats for energy and the synthesis of structural and functional lipids, such as those involved in the construction of cell membranes. in animals, these fats are obtained from food or are synthesized by the liver. lipogenesis is the process of synthesizing these fats. the majority of lipids found in the human body from ingesting food are triglycerides and cholesterol. other types of lipids found in the body are fatty acids and membrane lipids. lipid metabolism is often considered as the digestion and absorption process of dietary fat; however, there are two sources of fats that organisms can use to obtain energy: from consumed dietary fats and from stored fat. vertebrates (including humans) use both sources of fat to produce energy for organs such as the heart to function. since lipids are hydrophobic molecules, they need to be solubilized before their metabolism can begin. lipid metabolism often begins with hydrolysis, which occurs with the help of various enzymes in the digestive system. lipid metabolism also occurs in plants, though the processes differ in some ways when compared to animals. the second step after the hydrolysis is the absorption of the fatty acids into the epithelial cells of the intestinal wall. in the epithelial cells, fatty acids are packaged and transported to the rest of the body.


== lipid digestion ==
digestion is the first step to lipid metabolism, and it is the process of breaking the triglycerides down into smaller monoglyceride units with the help of lipase enzymes. digestion of fats begin in the mouth through chemical digestion by lingual lipase. ingested cholesterol is not broken down by the lipases and stays intact until it enters the epithelium cells of small intestine. lipids then continue to the stomach where chemical digestion continues by gastric lipase and mechanical digestion begins (peristalsis). the majority of lipid digestion and absorption, however, occurs once the fats reach the small intestines. chemicals from the pancreas (pancreatic lipase family and bile salt-dependent lipase) are secreted into the small intestines to help breakdown the triglycerides, along with further mechanical digestion, until they are individual fatty acid units able to be absorbed into the small intestine's epithelial cells. it is the pancreatic lipase that is responsible for signaling for the hydrolysis of the triglycerides into separate free fatty acids and glycerol units.


== lipid absorption ==
the second step in lipid metabolism is absorption of fats. short chain fatty acids can be absorbed in the stomach, while most absorption of fats occurs only in the small intestines. once the triglycerides are broken down into individual fatty acids and glycerols, along with cholesterol, they will aggregate into structures called micelles. fatty acids and monoglycerides leave the micelles and diffuse across the membrane to enter the intestinal epithelial cells. in the cytosol of epithelial cells, fatty acids and monoglycerides are recombined back into triglycerides. in the cytosol of epithelial cells, triglycerides and cholesterol are packaged into bigger particles called chylomicrons which are amphipathic structures that transport digested lipids.   chylomicrons will travel through the bloodstream to enter adipose and other tissues in the body.


== lipid transportation ==
due to the hydrophobic nature of membrane lipids, triglycerides and cholesterols, they require special transport proteins known as lipoproteins. the amphipathic structure of lipoproteins allows the tryglycerols and cholesterol to be transported through the blood. chylomicrons are one sub-group of lipoproteins which carry the digested lipids from small intestine to the rest of the body. the varying densities between the types of lipoproteins are characteristic to what type of fats they transport. for example, very-low-density lipoproteins (vldl) carry the synthesized triglycerides by our body and low-density lipoproteins (ldl) transport cholesterol to our peripheral tissues. a number of these lipoproteins are synthesized in the liver, but not all of them originate from this organ.


== lipid catabolism ==
once the chylomicrons (or other lipoproteins) travel through the tissues, these particles will be broken down by lipoprotein lipase in the luminal surface of endothelial cells in capillaries to release triglycerides. triglycerides will get broken down into fatty acids and glycerol before entering cells and remaining cholesterol will again travel through the blood to the liver.

in the cytosol of the cell (for example a muscle cell), the glycerol will be converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which is an intermediate in the glycolysis, to get further oxidized and produce energy. however, the main steps of fatty acids catabolism occur in the mitochondria. long chain fatty acids (more than 14 carbon) need to be converted to fatty acyl-coa in order to pass across the mitochondria membrane. fatty acid catabolism begins in the cytoplasm of cells as acyl-coa synthetase uses the energy from cleavage of an atp to catalyze the addition of coenzyme a to the fatty acid. the resulting acyl-coa cross the mitochondria membrane and enter the process of beta oxidation. the main products of the beta oxidation pathway are acetyl-coa (which is used in the citric acid cycle to produce energy), nadh and fadh. the process of beta oxidation requires the following enzymes: acyl-coa dehydrogenase, enoyl-coa hydratase, 3-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenase, and 3-ketoacyl-coa thiolase. the diagram to the left shows how fatty acids are converted into acetyl-coa. the overall net reaction, using palmitoyl-coa (16:0) as a model substrate is:

7 fad + 7 nad+ + 7 coash + 7 h2o + h(ch2ch2)7ch2co-scoa → 8 ch3co-scoa + 7 fadh2 + 7 nadh + 7 h+


== lipid biosynthesis ==
in addition to dietary fats, storage lipids stored in the adipose tissues are one of the main sources of energy for living organisms. triacylglycerols, lipid membrane and cholesterol can be synthesized by the organisms through various pathways.


=== membrane lipid biosynthesis ===
there are two major classes of membrane lipids: glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids. although many different membrane lipids are synthesized in our body, pathways share the same pattern. the first step is synthesizing the backbone (sphingosine or glycerol), the second step is the addition of fatty acids to the backbone to make phosphatidic acid. phosphatidic acid is further modified with the attachment of different hydrophilic head groups to the backbone. membrane lipid biosynthesis occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.


=== triglyceride biosynthesis ===
the phosphatidic acid is also a precursor for triglyceride biosynthesis. phosphatidic acid phosphotase catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidic acid to diacylglyceride, which will be converted to triacylglyceride by acyltransferase. tryglyceride biosynthesis occurs in the cytosol.


=== fatty acid biosynthesis ===
the precursor for fatty acids is acetyl-coa and it occurs in the cytosol of the cell. the overall net reaction, using palmitate (16:0) as a model substrate is:
8 acetyl-coa + 7 atp + 14 nadph + 6h+ → palmitate + 14 nadp+ + 6h2o + 7adp + 7p¡


=== cholesterol biosynthesis ===
cholesterol can be made from acetyl-coa through a multiple-step pathway known as isoprenoid pathway. cholesterols are essential because they can be modified to form different hormones in the body such as progesterone. 70% of cholesterol biosynthesis occurs in the cytosol of liver cells.


== lipid metabolism disorders ==
lipid metabolism disorders (including inborn errors of lipid metabolism) are illnesses where trouble occurs in breaking down or synthesizing fats (or fat-like substances). lipid metabolism disorders are associated with an increase in the concentrations of plasma lipids in the blood such as ldl cholesterol, vldl, and triglycerides which most commonly lead to cardiovascular diseases. a good deal of the time these disorders are hereditary, meaning it's a condition that is passed along from parent to child through their genes. gaucher's disease (types i, ii, and iii), niemann–pick disease, tay–sachs disease, and fabry's disease are all diseases where those afflicted can have a disorder of their body's lipid metabolism. rarer diseases concerning a disorder of the lipid metabolism are sitosterolemia, wolman's disease, refsum's disease, and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.


== types of lipids ==
the types of lipids involved in lipid metabolism include:

membrane lipids:
phospholipids: phospholipids are a major component of the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane and are found in many parts of the body.
sphingolipids: sphingolipids are mostly found in the cell membrane of neural tissue.
glycolipids: the main role of glycolipids is to maintain lipid bilayer stability and facilitate cell recognition.
glycerophospholipids: neural tissue (including the brain) contains high amounts of glycerophospholipids.
other types of lipids:
cholesterols: cholesterols are the main precursors for different hormones in our body such as progesterone and testosterone. the main function of cholesterol is controlling the cell membrane fluidity.
steroid – see also steroidogenesis: steroids are one of the important cell signalling molecules.
triacylglycerols (fats) – see also lipolysis and lipogenesis: triacylglycerides are the major form of energy storage in human body.
fatty acids – see also fatty acid metabolism: fatty acids are one of the precursors used for lipid membrane and cholesterol biosynthesis. they are also used for energy.
bile salts: bile salts are secreted from liver and they facilitate lipid digestion in the small intestine.
eicosanoids: eicosanoids are made from fatty acids in the body and they are used for cell signaling.
ketone bodies: ketone bodies are made from fatty acids in the liver. their function is to produce energy during periods of starvation or low food intake.

"not censorship, but selection",non_science,"""not censorship but selection"" is a 1953 article written by lester asheim. it was initially published in the wilson library bulletin, and has been influential in library professional standards relating to censorship and collection development. the full text of the article currently resides on the website of the american library association.


== overview ==
this seminal 1953 article on the difference between censorship and selection in libraries influenced later thought and formed the cornerstone of many intellectual freedom documents.


== summary ==
in the first section of the article asheim goes over the difference of censorship of a book by the law or by a town, versus the choice of a librarian not to select something for her library.  he states that the librarian is not censoring because she is making a choice that only affects her specific institution, whereas the choice the censors are making affect an entire town or nation.  the librarian is not saying that the book cannot be circulated, only that she is not going to circulate it.  patrons are still able to get it elsewhere.
asheim then brings up the question of limited control.  he wonders if limited control, which the librarian has when choosing not to select a book, is any different from the limited control of the local pressure group.  he then concludes that it is different because the reasons and motives behind the choice are different.  he also believes that the patron who is being denied the book is affected differently depending on the intent of the person who is choosing to limit the book.  asheim makes the analogy of the difference between someone’s leg being amputated by a doctor who is doing it because it is necessary, versus a leg being amputated by someone who is psychotic and is doing it because of a sick compulsion.  the man who has had his leg amputated by the psychotic knows the difference and is affected differently than if a doctor had done it out of a need to help his patient.
because it is a physical impossibility to make all books equally accessible, selection by librarians is necessary. asheim writes that some of the standards that librarians use for selecting books are the same standards that censors use to ban books.  for example, it is valid to use the intent of the author as a selection standard, however it can also be used to ban a book in which it is decided that the author's intent is pornographic or treasonable. the standards are subjective.  therefore, the difference between selection and censorship is found in the way the standards are applied.
asheim argues that the main difference between a selector and a censor is in their approach: the selector's is positive, the censor's is negative. the selector, seeking to preserve, looks to find reasons to keep a book.  the censor, seeking to ban, looks for reasons to reject a book.  asheim says that the negative approach makes it inevitable that a book will be judged not in its wholeness but by isolated parts.  he writes that the selector's positive approach is demonstrated by the diversity of a library's collection that makes as much as possible accessible to patrons.  further, he believes that the frequency of challenges to library holdings is in itself a testament to the difference between selection and censorship.
he writes that the censor uses external criteria to judge a book; for instance, the author's life may be examined and used as a way to reject a work.  the selector, on the other hand, uses internal values and judges a book by its own merit. he calls selection democratic and censorship authoritarian.  finally, asheim reminds that the confidence the public has in librarians is an earned confidence that can only be kept by staying true to the profession's ideals.  and one of these ideals is maintaining the essential difference between selection and censorship.


== influence ==
asheim's article has influenced many in the library profession and authors continue to cite it when responding to the changing censorship landscape.  in 2002, tony doyle drew upon asheim's article to talk about censorship in the aftermath of the september 11 attacks and june pinnell-stephens argued that asheim's censorship/selection distinction is useful for understanding collection development and censorship in the digital age.  it has been argued that the dichotomy of ""censorship"" and ""selection"" has the effect of othering the censor. in 2010, rickey best cited asheim in an article portraying academic libraries as bastions of intellectual freedom for maintaining access to materials that were frequently challenged in public libraries.


== reappraisal ==
in 1983, asheim wrote a reappraisal of his own article to address the changing tactics of censors and to challenge the persistent assumption that librarians select materials based primarily on their personal tastes.  asheim characterizes groups such as the moral majority as having recently (at the time of his writing) switched from attempting to have objectionable books removed to attempting to have books they approved of included to such an extent that the library's collection would be skewed to their perspective. in response, asheim further emphasizes that segments of the library's patron base should not be allowed to impede each other's rights, and that the job of the librarian is to make selection choices with the library's entire community in mind. he also upholds his prior assertion that the best response to the problem of access is to add ideas rather than to remove them.

kidney venous blood vessel cell,cell,"thrombosis (from ancient greek θρόμβωσις thrómbōsis ""clotting”) is the formation of a blood clot inside a blood vessel, obstructing the flow of blood through the circulatory system. when a blood vessel (a vein or an artery) is injured, the body uses platelets (thrombocytes) and fibrin to form a blood clot to prevent blood loss.  even when a blood vessel is not injured, blood clots may form in the body under certain conditions. a clot, or a piece of the clot, that breaks free and begins to travel around the body is known as an embolus.thrombosis may occur in veins (venous thrombosis) or in arteries (arterial thrombosis). venous thrombosis leads to congestion of the affected part of the body, while arterial thrombosis (and rarely severe venous thrombosis) affects the blood supply and leads to damage of the tissue supplied by that artery (ischemia and necrosis). a piece of either an arterial or a venous thrombus can break off as an embolus which can travel through the circulation and lodge somewhere else as an embolism. this type of embolism is known as a thromboembolism. complications can arise when a venous thromboembolism (commonly called a vte) lodges in the lung as a pulmonary embolism. an arterial embolus may travel further down the affected blood vessel where it can lodge as an embolism.


== signs and symptoms ==
thrombosis is generally defined by the type of blood vessel affected (arterial or venous thrombosis) and the precise location of the blood vessel or the organ supplied by it.


=== venous thrombosis ===


==== deep vein thrombosis ====

deep vein thrombosis (dvt) is the formation of a blood clot within a deep vein. it most commonly affects leg veins, such as the femoral vein. three factors are important in the formation of a blood clot within a deep vein—these are the rate of blood flow, the thickness of the blood and qualities of the vessel wall. classical signs of dvt include swelling, pain and redness of the affected area.


==== paget-schroetter disease ====

paget-schroetter disease or upper extremity dvt (uedvt) is the obstruction of an arm vein (such as the axillary vein or subclavian vein) by a thrombus. the condition usually comes to light after vigorous exercise and usually presents in younger, otherwise healthy people. men are affected more than women.


==== budd-chiari syndrome ====

budd-chiari syndrome is the blockage of a hepatic vein or of the hepatic part of the inferior vena cava. this form of thrombosis presents with abdominal pain, ascites and enlarged liver. treatment varies between therapy and surgical intervention by the use of shunts.


==== portal vein thrombosis ====

portal vein thrombosis affects the hepatic portal vein, which can lead to portal hypertension and reduction of the blood supply to the liver. it usually happens in the setting of another disease such as pancreatitis, cirrhosis, diverticulitis or cholangiocarcinoma.


==== renal vein thrombosis ====

renal vein thrombosis is the obstruction of the renal vein by a thrombus. this tends to lead to reduced drainage from the kidney.


==== cerebral venous sinus thrombosis ====

cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (cvst) is a rare form of stroke which results from the blockage of the dural venous sinuses by a thrombus. symptoms may include headache, abnormal vision, any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness of the face and limbs on one side of the body and seizures. the diagnosis is usually made with a ct or mri scan. the majority of persons affected make a full recovery. the mortality rate is 4.3%.


==== jugular vein thrombosis ====
jugular vein thrombosis is a condition that may occur due to infection, intravenous drug use or malignancy. jugular vein thrombosis can have a varying list of complications, including: systemic sepsis, pulmonary embolism, and papilledema. though characterized by a sharp pain at the site of the vein, it can prove difficult to diagnose, because it can occur at random.


==== cavernous sinus thrombosis ====

cavernous sinus thrombosis is a specialised form of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, where there is thrombosis of the cavernous sinus of the basal skull dura, due to the retrograde spread of infection and endothelial damage from the danger triangle of the face. the facial veins in this area anastomose with the superior and inferior ophthalmic veins of the orbit, which drain directly posteriorly into the cavernous sinus through the superior orbital fissure. staphyloccoal or streptococcal infections of the face, for example nasal or upper lip pustules may thus spread directly into the cavernous sinus, causing stroke-like symptoms of double vision, squint, as well as spread of infection to cause meningitis.


=== arterial thrombosis ===
arterial thrombosis is the formation of a thrombus within an artery. in most cases, arterial thrombosis follows rupture of atheroma (a fat-rich deposit in the blood vessel wall), and is therefore referred to as atherothrombosis. arterial embolism occurs when clots then migrate downstream, and can affect any organ.alternatively, arterial occlusion occurs as a consequence of embolism of blood clots originating from the heart (""cardiogenic"" emboli). the most common cause is atrial fibrillation, which causes a blood stasis within the atria with easy thrombus formation, but blood clots can develop inside the heart for other reasons too.


==== stroke ====

a stroke is the rapid decline of brain function due to a disturbance in the supply of blood to the brain. this can be due to ischemia, thrombus, embolus (a lodged particle) or hemorrhage (a bleed). in thrombotic stroke, a thrombus (blood clot) usually forms around atherosclerotic plaques. since blockage of the artery is gradual, onset of symptomatic thrombotic strokes is slower. thrombotic stroke can be divided into two categories—large vessel disease and small vessel disease. the former affects vessels such as the internal carotids, vertebral and the circle of willis. the latter can affect smaller vessels such as the branches of the circle of willis.


==== myocardial infarction ====

myocardial infarction (mi) or heart attack, is caused by ischemia, (restriction in the blood supply), often due to the obstruction of a coronary artery by a thrombus. this restriction gives an insufficient supply of oxygen to the heart muscle which then results in tissue death (infarction). a lesion is then formed which is the infarct. mi can quickly become fatal if emergency medical treatment is not received promptly. if diagnosed within 12 hours of the initial episode (attack) then thrombolytic therapy is initiated.


=== limb ischemia ===
an arterial thrombus or embolus can also form in the limbs, which can lead to acute limb ischemia.


==== other sites ====
hepatic artery thrombosis usually occurs as a devastating complication after liver transplantation.


== causes ==
thrombosis prevention is initiated with assessing the risk for its development. some people have a higher risk of developing thrombosis and its possible development into thromboembolism. some of these risk factors are related to inflammation. ""virchow's triad"" has been suggested to describe the three factors necessary for the formation of thrombosis: stasis of blood, vessel wall injury, and altered blood coagulation. some risk factors predispose for venous thrombosis while others increase the risk of arterial thrombosis.


== mechanism ==


=== pathogenesis ===
the main causes of thrombosis are given in virchow's triad which lists thrombophilia, endothelial cell injury, and disturbed blood flow.


==== hypercoagulability ====

hypercoagulability or thrombophilia, is caused by, for example, genetic deficiencies or autoimmune disorders. recent studies indicate that white blood cells play a pivotal role in deep vein thrombosis, mediating numerous pro-thrombotic actions.


==== endothelial cell injury ====
any inflammatory process, such as trauma, surgery or infection, can cause damage to the endothelial lining of the vessel's wall. the main mechanism is exposure of tissue factor to the blood coagulation system. inflammatory and other stimuli (such as hypercholesterolemia) can lead to changes in gene expression in endothelium producing to a pro-thrombotic state. when this occurs, endothelial cells downregulate substances such as thrombomodulin, which is a key modulator of thrombin activity. the end result is a sustained activation of thrombin and reduced production of protein c and tissue factor inhibitor, which furthers the pro-thrombotic state.endothelial injury is almost invariably involved in the formation of thrombi in arteries, as high rates of blood flow normally hinder clot formation. in addition, arterial and cardiac clots are normally rich in platelets–which are required for clot formation in areas under high stress due to blood flow.


==== disturbed blood flow ====

causes of disturbed blood flow include stagnation of blood flow past the point of injury, or venous stasis which may occur in heart failure, or after long periods of sedentary behaviour, such as sitting on a long airplane flight. also, atrial fibrillation, causes stagnant blood in the left atrium (la), or left atrial appendage (laa), and can lead to a thromboembolism. cancers or malignancies such as leukemia may cause increased risk of thrombosis by possible activation of the coagulation system by cancer cells or secretion of procoagulant substances (paraneoplastic syndrome), by external compression on a blood vessel when a solid tumor is present, or (more rarely) extension into the vasculature (for example, renal cell cancers extending into the renal veins). also, treatments for cancer (radiation, chemotherapy) often cause additional hypercoagulability. there are scores that correlate different aspects of patient data (comorbidities, vital signs, and others) to risk of thrombosis, such as the pompe-c, which stratifies risk of mortality due to pulmonary embolism in patients with cancer, who typically have higher rates of thrombosis. also, there are several predictive scores for thromboembolic events, such as padua, khorana, and throly score.


=== pathophysiology ===


==== natural history ====
fibrinolysis is the physiological breakdown of blood clots by enzymes such as plasmin.
organisation: following the thrombotic event, residual vascular thrombus will be re-organised histologically with several possible outcomes. for an occlusive thrombus (defined as thrombosis within a small vessel that leads to complete occlusion), wound healing will reorganise the occlusive thrombus into collagenous scar tissue, where the scar tissue will either permanently obstruct the vessel, or contract down with myofibroblastic activity to unblock the lumen. for a mural thrombus (defined as a thrombus in a large vessel that restricts the blood flow but does not occlude completely), histological reorganisation of the thrombus does not occur via the classic wound healing mechanism. instead, the platelet-derived growth factor degranulated by the clotted platelets will attract a layer of smooth muscle cells to cover the clot, and this layer of mural smooth muscle will be vascularised by the blood inside the vessel lumen rather than by the vasa vasorum.
ischemia/infarction: if an arterial thrombus cannot be lysed by the body and it does not embolise, and if the thrombus is large enough to impair or occlude blood flow in the involved artery, then local ischemia or infarction will result. a venous thrombus may or may not be ischemic, since veins distribute deoxygenated blood that is less vital for cellular metabolism. nevertheless, non-ischemic venous thrombosis may still be problematic, due to the swelling caused by blockage to venous drainage. in deep vein thrombosis this manifests as pain, redness, and swelling; in retinal vein occlusion this may result in macular oedema and visual acuity impairment, which if severe enough can lead to blindness.


==== embolization ====

a thrombus may become detached and enter circulation as an embolus, finally lodging in and completely obstructing a blood vessel, which unless treated very quickly will lead to tissue necrosis (an infarction) in the area past the occlusion. venous thrombosis can lead to pulmonary embolism when the migrated embolus becomes lodged in the lung. in people with a ""shunt"" (a connection between the pulmonary and systemic circulation), either in the heart or in the lung, a venous clot can also end up in the arteries and cause arterial embolism.arterial embolism can lead to obstruction of blood flow through the blood vessel that is obstructed by it, and lack of oxygen and nutrients (ischemia) of the downstream tissue. the tissue can become irreversibly damaged, a process known as necrosis. this can affect any organ; for instance, arterial embolism of the brain is one of the cause of stroke.


== prevention ==

the use of heparin following surgery is common if there are no issues with bleeding. generally, a risk-benefit analysis is required, as all anticoagulants lead to an increased risk of bleeding. in people admitted to hospital, thrombosis is a major cause for complications and occasionally death. in the uk, for instance, the parliamentary health select committee heard in 2005 that the annual rate of death due to thrombosis was 25,000, with at least 50% of these being hospital-acquired. hence thromboprophylaxis (prevention of thrombosis) is increasingly emphasized. in patients admitted for surgery, graded compression stockings are widely used, and in severe illness, prolonged immobility and in all orthopedic surgery, professional guidelines recommend low molecular weight heparin (lmwh) administration, mechanical calf compression or (if all else is contraindicated and the patient has recently suffered deep vein thrombosis) the insertion of a vena cava filter. in patients with medical rather than surgical illness, lmwh too is known to prevent thrombosis, and in the united kingdom the chief medical officer has issued guidance to the effect that preventative measures should be used in medical patients, in anticipation of formal guidelines.


== treatment ==
the treatment for thrombosis depends on whether it is in a vein or an artery, the impact on the person, and the risk of complications from treatment.


=== anticoagulation ===

warfarin and vitamin k antagonists are anticoagulants that can be taken orally to reduce thromboembolic occurrence. where a more effective response is required, heparin can be given (by injection) concomitantly. as a side effect of any anticoagulant, the risk of bleeding is increased, so the international normalized ratio of blood is monitored. self-monitoring and self-management are safe options for competent patients, though their practice varies. in germany, about 20% of patients were self-managed while only 1% of u.s. patients did home self-testing (according to one 2012 study). other medications such as direct thrombin inhibitors and direct xa inhibitors are increasingly being used instead of warfarin.


=== thrombolysis ===
thrombolysis is the pharmacological destruction of blood clots by administering thrombolytic drugs including recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, which enhances the normal destruction of blood clots by the body's enzymes. this carries an increased risk of bleeding so is generally only used for specific situations (such as severe stroke or a massive pulmonary embolism).


=== surgery ===
arterial thrombosis may require surgery if it causes acute limb ischemia.


=== endovascular treatment ===
mechanical clot retrieval and catheter-guided thrombolysis are used in certain situations.


=== antiplatelet agents ===
arterial thrombosis is platelet-rich, and inhibition of platelet aggregation with antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin may reduce the risk of recurrence or progression.


=== targeting ischemia/reperfusion injury ===

with reperfusion comes ischemia/reperfusion (ir) injury (iri), which paradoxically causes cell death in reperfused tissue and contributes significantly to post-reperfusion mortality and morbidity. for example, in a feline model of intestinal ischemia, four hours of ischemia resulted in less injury than three hours of ischemia followed by one hour of reperfusion. in st-elevation myocardial infarction (stemi), iri contributes up to 50% of final infarct size despite timely primary percutaneous coronary intervention. this is a key reason for the continued high mortality and morbidity in these conditions, despite endovascular reperfusion treatments and continuous efforts to improve timeliness and access to these treatments. hence, protective therapies are required to attenuate iri alongside reperfusion in acute ischemic conditions to improve clinical outcomes. therapeutic strategies that have potential to improve clinical outcomes in reperfused stemi patients include remote ischemic conditioning (ric), exenatide, and metoprolol. these have emerged amongst a multitude of cardioprotective interventions investigated with largely neutral clinical data. of these, ric has the most robust clinical evidence, especially in the context of stemi, but also emerging for other indications such as acute ischemic stroke and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.

== gm1 and inherited disease ==
galactosidases are enzymes that break down gm1, and the failure to remove gm1 results in gm1 gangliosidosis. gm1 gangliosidosis are inherited disorders that progressively destroy neurons in the brain and spinal cord as gm1 accumulates. without treatment, this results in developmental decline and muscle weakness, eventually leading to severe retardation and death.


== gm1 and acquired disease ==
antibodies to gm1 are increased in guillain–barré syndrome, dementia and lupus but their function is not clear.  there is some evidence to suggest antibodies against gm1 are associated with diarrhea in guillain–barré syndrome.gm1 antibodies are also seen in multifocal motor neuropathy (mmn), a rare antibody-mediated inflammatory neuropathy.


== gm1 and the cholera toxin ==
the bacteria vibrio cholerae produces a multimeric toxin called the cholera toxin. the secreted toxin attaches to the surface of the host mucosa cell by binding to gm1 gangliosides. gm1 consists of a sialic acid-containing oligosaccharide covalently attached to a ceramide lipid.  the a1 subunit of this toxin will gain entry to intestinal epithelial cells with the assistance of the b subunit via the gm1 ganglioside receptor.  once inside, the a1 subunit will adp ribosylate the gs alpha subunit which will prevent its gtpase activity.  this will lock it in the active state and it will continuously stimulate adenylate cyclase.  the sustained adenylate cyclase activity will lead to a sustained increase of camp which will cause electrolyte and water loss, causing diarrhea.the sglt1 receptor is present in the small intestine.  when the cholera patient is given a solution containing water, sodium and glucose, the sglt1 receptor will reabsorb sodium and glucose, while water will be passively absorbed with the sodium.  this will replace the water and electrolyte loss in the cholera-induced diarrhea.


== therapeutic applications ==
because of gm1's close role in neuron repair mechanisms, it has been investigated as a possible drug to slow or even reverse the progression of a wide range of neurodegenerative conditions. controlled phase ii studies have indicated that gm1 can ease the symptoms of parkinson's disease, presumably by countering degeneration of the substantia nigra, and a similar methodology has been pursued to try and limit cellular damage from necrosis and apoptosis occurring after acute spinal cord injury.

liatris,non_science,"liatris () is a genus of flowering plants in the boneset tribe within the sunflower family native to north america (canada, united states, mexico and the bahamas). its most common name is blazing star. some species are used as ornamental plants, sometimes in flower bouquets.
they are perennials, surviving the winter in the form of corms.liatris species are used as food plants by the larvae of some lepidoptera species including the flower moths schinia gloriosa and schinia sanguinea, both of which feed exclusively on the genus, and schinia tertia and schinia trifascia.


== classification ==
liatris is in the tribe eupatorieae of the aster family.  like other members of this tribe, the flower heads have disc florets and no ray florets. liatris is in the subtribe liatrinae along with trilisa, carphephorus, and other genera. liatris is closely related to  garberia, a genus with only one species endemic to florida. the two genera can be distinguished by the shrub form of the latter and by karyotype.

ofloxacin,antibiotic,"ofloxacin is a quinolone antibiotic useful for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections. when taken by mouth or injection into a vein, these include pneumonia, cellulitis, urinary tract infections, prostatitis, plague, and certain types of infectious diarrhea. other uses, along with other medications, include treating multidrug resistant tuberculosis. an eye drop may be used for a superficial bacterial infection of the eye and an ear drop may be used for otitis media when a hole in the ear drum is present.when taken by mouth, common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and rash. other serious side effect include tendon rupture, numbness due to nerve damage, seizures, and psychosis. use in pregnancy is typically not recommended. ofloxacin is in the fluoroquinolone family of medications. it works by interfering with the bacterium's dna.ofloxacin was patented in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1985. it is on the world health organization's list of essential medicines. ofloxacin is available as a generic medication. in 2017, it was the 278th most commonly prescribed medication in the united states, with more than one million prescriptions.


== medical uses ==
ofloxacin is used in the treatment of bacterial infections such as:

acute bacterial exacerbations of copd
community-acquired pneumonia
uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections
nongonococcal urethritis and cervicitis
epididymitis
mixed infections of the urethra and cervix
acute pelvic inflammatory disease
uncomplicated cystitis
complicated urinary tract infections
prostatitis
acute, uncomplicated urethral and cervical gonorrheaofloxacin has not been shown to be effective in the treatment of syphilis. ofloxacin is no longer considered a first-line treatment for gonorrhea, because of bacterial resistance.


=== susceptible bacteria ===
according to the product package insert, ofloxacin is effective against these microorganisms:aerobic gram-positive microorganisms:

staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains)
streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible strains)
streptococcus pyogenesaerobic gram-negative microorganisms 

citrobacter koseri (citrobacter diversus)
enterobacter aerogenes
escherichia coli
haemophilus influenzae
klebsiella pneumoniae
neisseria gonorrhoeae
proteus mirabilis
pseudomonas aeruginosaother microorganisms:

chlamydia trachomatis


== adverse effects ==

in general, fluoroquinolones are well tolerated, with most side effects being mild to moderate.  on occasion, serious adverse effects occur. common side effects include gastrointestinal effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, as well as headache and insomnia.
the overall rate of adverse events in patients treated with fluoroquinolones is roughly similar to that seen in patients treated with other antibiotic classes. a u.s. centers for disease control study found patients treated with fluoroquinolones experienced adverse events severe enough to lead to an emergency department visit more frequently than those treated with cephalosporins or macrolides, but less frequently than those treated with penicillins, clindamycin, sulfonamides, or vancomycin.postmarketing surveillance has revealed a variety of relatively rare but serious adverse effects associated with all members of the fluoroquinolone antibacterial class. among these, tendon problems and exacerbation of the symptoms of the neurological disorder myasthenia gravis are the subject of ""black box"" warnings in the united states. the most severe form of tendonopathy associated with fluoroquinolone administration is tendon rupture, which in the great majority of cases involves the achilles tendon. younger people typically experience good recovery, but permanent disability is possible, and is more likely in older patients.  the overall frequency of fluoroquinolone-associated achilles tendon rupture in patients treated with ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin has been estimated at 17 per 100,000 treatments. risk is substantially elevated in the elderly and in those with recent exposure to topical or systemic corticosteroid therapy. simultaneous use of corticosteroids is present in almost one-third of quinolone-associated tendon rupture. tendon damage may manifest during and up to a year after fluoroquinolone therapy has been completed.fluoroquinolones prolong the qt interval by blocking voltage-gated potassium channels. prolongation of the qt interval can lead to torsades de pointes, a life-threatening arrhythmia, but in practice, this appears relatively uncommon in part because the most widely prescribed fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) only minimally prolong the qt interval.clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea may occur in connection with the use of any antibacterial drug, especially those with a broad spectrum of activity such as clindamycin, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones. fluoroquinoline treatment is associated with risk similar to or less  than that associated with broad spectrum cephalosporins. fluoroquinoline administration may be associated with the acquisition and outgrowth of a particularly virulent clostridium strain.the u.s. prescribing information contains a warning regarding uncommon cases of peripheral neuropathy, which can be permanent. other nervous system effects include insomnia, restlessness, and rarely, seizure, convulsions, and psychosis other rare and serious adverse events have been observed with varying degrees of evidence for causation.events that may occur in acute overdose are rare, and include kidney failure and seizure. susceptible groups of patients, such as children and the elderly, are at greater risk of adverse reactions during therapeutic use.ofloxacin, like some other fluoroquinolones, may inhibit drug-metabolizing enzymes, and thereby increase blood levels of other drugs such as cyclosporine, theophylline, and warfarin, among others. these increased blood levels may result in a greater risk of side effects.
careful monitoring of serum glucose is advised when ofloxacin or other fluorquinolones are used by people who are taking sulfonylurea antidiabetes drugs.
the concomitant administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with a quinolone, including ofloxacin, may increase the risk of central nervous system stimulation and convulsive seizures.
the fluoroquinolones have been shown to increase the anticoagulant effect of acenocoumarol, anisindione, and dicumarol. additionally, the risk of cardiotoxicity and arrhythmias is increased when co-administered with drugs such as dihydroquinidine barbiturate, quinidine, and quinidine barbiturate.current or past treatment with oral corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of achilles tendon rupture, especially in elderly patients who are also taking the fluoroquinolones.


== contraindications ==
as noted above, under licensed use, ofloxacin is now considered to be contraindicated for the treatment of certain sexually transmitted diseases by some experts due to bacterial resistance.
caution should be used in people with liver disease. the excretion of ofloxacin may be reduced in patients with severe liver function disorders (e.g., cirrhosis with or without ascites).
ofloxacin is also considered to be contraindicated within the pediatric population, pregnancy, nursing mothers, patients with psychiatric illnesses and in patients with epilepsy or other seizure disorders.


=== pregnancy ===
ofloxacin has not been shown to have any teratogenic effects at oral doses as high as 810 mg/kg/day (11 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m2 or 50 times based on mg/kg) and 160 mg/kg/day (four times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m2 or 10 times based on mg/kg) when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits, respectively. additional studies in rats with oral doses up to 360 mg/kg/day (five times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m2 or 23 times based on mg/kg) demonstrated no adverse effect on late fetal development, labor, delivery, lactation, neonatal viability, or growth of the newborn. doses equivalent to 50 and 10 times the recommended maximum human dose of ofloxacin (based on mg/kg) were fetotoxic (i.e., decreased fetal body weight and increased fetal mortality) in rats and rabbits, respectively. minor skeletal variations were reported in rats receiving doses of 810 mg/kg/day, which is more than 10 times higher than the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m2.
there are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. ofloxacin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.


=== children ===
oral and intravenous ofloxacin are not licensed for use in children, except as noted above, due to the risk of musculoskeletal injury. in one study, 1534 juvenile patients (age 6 months to 16 years) treated with levofloxacin as part of three efficacy trials were followed up to assess all musculoskeletal events occurring up to 12 months after treatment. at 12 months' follow-up, the cumulative incidence of musculoskeletal adverse events was 3.4%, compared to 1.8% among 893 patients treated with other antibiotics.  in the levafloxacin-treated group, about two-thirds of these musculoskeletal adverse events occurred in the first 60 days, 86% were mild, 17% were moderate, and all resolved without long-term sequelae.
in a study comparing the safety and efficacy of levofloxacin to that of azithromycin or ceftriaxone in 712 children with community-acquired pneumonia, adverse events were experienced by 6% of those treated with levofloxacin and 4% of those treated with comparator antibiotics. most of these adverse events were thought to be unrelated or doubtfully related to the levofloxacin. two deaths were observed in the levofloxacin group, neither of which was thought to be treatment-related. spontaneous reports to the fda adverse effects reporting system at the time of the 20 september 2011 fda pediatric drugs advisory committee include musculoskeletal events (39, including five cases of tendon rupture) and central nervous system events (19, including five cases of seizures) as the most common spontaneous reports between april 2005 and march 2008. an estimated 130,000 pediatric prescriptions for levofloxacin were filled on behalf of 112,000 pediatric patients during that period.


== overdose ==
limited information is available on overdose with ofloxacin. advice for the management of an acute overdose of ofloxacin is emptying of the stomach, along with close observation, and making sure that the patient is appropriately hydrated. hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is of only limited effectiveness. overdose may result in central nervous system toxicity, cardiovascular toxicity, tendon/articular toxicity, and hepatic toxicity as well as kidney failure and seizure. both seizures and severe psychiatric reactions have, however, been reported to occur at therapeutic dosage.


== pharmacokinetics ==

the bioavailability of ofloxacin in the tablet form is roughly 98% following oral administration, reaching maximum serum concentrations within one to two hours. between 65% and 80% of an administered oral dose of ofloxacin is excreted unchanged via the kidneys within 48 hours of dosing. therefore, elimination is mainly by renal excretion. however, 4-8% of an ofloxacin dose is excreted in the feces. this would indicate a small degree of biliary excretion, as well. plasma elimination half-life is around 4 to 5 hours in patients and 6.4 to 7.4 hours in elderly patients.ofloxacin is a racemic mixture, which consists of 50% levofloxacin (the biologically active component) and 50% of its “mirror image” or enantiomer dextrofloxacin.""after multiple-dose administration of 200 mg and 300 mg doses, peak serum levels of 2.2  and 3.6 μg/ml, respectively, are predicted at steady-state. in vitro, approximately 32% of the drug in plasma is protein bound. floxin is widely distributed to body tissues. ofloxacin has been detected in blister fluid, cervix, lung tissue, ovary, prostatic fluid, prostatic tissue, skin, and sputum. pyridobenzoxazine ring appears to decrease the extent of parent compound metabolism. less than 5% is eliminated by the kidneys as desmethyl or n-oxide metabolites; 4% to 8% by feces.""a number of the endogenous compounds have been reported to be affected by ofloxacin as inhibitors, alteraters, and depletors. see the latest package insert for ofloxacin for additional details.


== mode of action ==
ofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. it functions by inhibiting two bacterial type ii topoisomerases, dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv. topo iv is an enzyme necessary to separate (mostly in prokaryotes, in bacteria in particular) replicated dna, thereby inhibiting bacterial cell division.


== history ==
ofloxacin is a second-generation fluoroquinolone, being a broader-spectrum analog of norfloxacin, and was synthesized and developed by scientists at daiichi seiyaku.it was first approved for marketing in japan in 1985, for oral administration, and daiichi marketed it there under the brand name tarvid.  daiichi, working with johnson & johnson, obtained fda approval in december 1990, under the brand name floxin, labelled for use in adults with lower respiratory tract infections, skin and skin structure infections, urinary tract infections, prostatitis, and sexually transmitted diseases.   by 1991, it was also marketed as tarvid by hoechst in the uk, germany, belgium, and portugal; as oflocet in france, portugal, tunisia, and several african countries by roussel-uclafas, as  oflocin by glaxo in italy, and as flobacin by sigma-tau in italy.the market for ofloxacin was seen as difficult from its launch; it was approved as a ""1c"" drug, a new molecular entity with little or no therapeutic gain over existing therapies, and ciprofloxacin, which had a broader spectrum, was already on the market.by 1992, an intravenous solution was approved for marketing,in 1997, an indication for pelvic inflammatory disease was approved by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) for the oral formulation, and in the same year, a solution for ear infections was approved under the brand daiichi and j&j also cannibalized its own market by introducing levofloxacin, the levo-enantiomer of ofloxacin, in 1996; johnson and johnson's annual sales of floxin in 2003 was about $30 million, whereas their combined sales of levaquin/floxin exceeded $1.15 billion in the same year. johnson & johnson withdrew the marketing application in 2009.


== society and culture ==


=== available forms ===
ofloxacin for systemic use is available as a tablet (multiple strengths), an oral solution (250 mg/ml), and an injectable solution (multiple strengths). it is also used as eye drops and ear drops and is available in combination with ornidazole.

ofloxacin should be administered as described within the dosage guidelines table found within the most recent package insert. the status of the patient's renal function and hepatic function must also be taken into consideration to avoid an accumulation that may lead to a fatal drug overdose. ofloxacin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion. however, the drug is also metabolized and partially cleared through the liver. modification of the dosage is' required using the table found within the package insert for those with impaired liver or kidney function (particularly for patients with severe renal dysfunction). however, since the drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidneys, the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. the duration of treatment depends upon the severity of infection and the usual duration is 7 to 14 days.


=== antibiotic use and bacterial resistance ===

resistance to ofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones may evolve rapidly, even during a course of treatment. numerous pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and streptococcus pyogenes now exhibit resistance worldwide.floxacin and other fluoroquinolones had become the most commonly prescribed class of antibiotics to adults in 2002. nearly half (42%) of these prescriptions were for conditions not approved by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda), such as acute bronchitis, otitis media, and acute upper respiratory tract infection, according to a study that was supported in part by the agency for healthcare research and quality. additionally they are commonly prescribed for medical conditions that are not even bacterial to begin with, such as viral infections, or those to which no proven benefit exists.

""ofloxacin"". drug information portal. u.s. national library of medicine."
urea chewing gum,drug,"this article describes the anatomy of the head and neck of the human body, including the brain, bones, muscles, blood vessels, nerves, glands, nose, mouth, teeth, tongue, and throat.


== structure ==


=== bones ===
the head rests on the top part of the vertebral column, with the skull joining at c1 (the first cervical vertebra known as the atlas). the skeletal section of the head and neck forms the top part of the axial skeleton and is made up of the skull, hyoid bone, auditory ossicles,  and cervical spine. 
the skull can be further subdivided into:

the cranium (8 bones: frontal, 2-parietal, occipital, 2-temporal, sphenoid, ethmoid), and
the facial bones (14 bones: 2-zygomatic, 2-maxillary, 2-palatine, 2-nasal, 2-lacrimal, vomer, 2-inferior conchae, mandible).the occipital bone joins with the atlas near the foramen magnum, a large hole (foramen) at the base of the skull. the atlas joins with the occipital condyle above and the axis below. the spinal cord passes through the foramen magnum.


=== muscles ===


=== skin ===
the head and neck is covered in skin and its appendages, termed the integumentary system. these include hair, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, and sensory nerves. the skin is made up of three microscopic layers: epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis. the epidermis is composed of stratified squamous epithelium and is divided into the following five sublayers or strata, listed in order from outer to inner:

stratum corneum,
stratum lucidum,
stratum granulosum,
stratum spinosum,
stratum germinativum also called stratum basale. the deepest layer is the miotic layer, stratum basale producing daughter cells by mitosis.


=== mouth ===

the mouth, also called the oral cavity, is the entranceway into the digestive system containing both primary and accessory organs of digestion.


==== teeth ====

two rows of teeth are supported by facial bones of the skull, the maxilla above and the mandible below. adults have 32 permanent teeth, and children have 20 deciduous teeth. there are various tooth shapes for different jobs. for example, when chewing, the upper teeth work together with the lower teeth of the same shape to bite, chew, and tear food. the names of these teeth are:

(1) incisors, there are eight incisors located in the front of the mouth (four on the top and four on the bottom). they have sharp, chisel-shaped crowns that cut food.
(2) cuspids (or canine tooth), the four cuspids are next to each incisor. cuspids have a pointed edge to tear food.
(3) premolars (or bicuspids), the four pairs of molars are located next to the cuspids. they crush and tear food.
(4) molars, there are twelve molars, in sets of three, at the back of the mouth. they have wide surfaces that help to grind food.the white visible part of a tooth is called the crown. the rounded upper projections of the back teeth are cusps. the hard white exterior covering of the tooth is the enamel. as the tooth tapers below the gumline, the neck is formed. below the neck, holding the tooth into the bone, is the root of the tooth. the inner portions of the tooth consist of the dentin, a bonelike tissue, and the pulp. the pulp is a soft tissue area containing the nerve and blood vessels to nourish and protect the tooth, located within the pulp cavity.
a tooth sits in a specialized socket called the alveolus. the tooth is held in location by a periodontal ligament, with the assistance of cementum. teeth are surrounded by gingiva, or gums, part of the periodontium, support tissue of oral cavity protection. the periodontium includes all of the support membranes of the dental structures surround and support the teeth such as the gums and the attachment surfaces and membranes. these include epithelial tissues (epithelium), connective tissues, (ligaments and bone), muscle tissue and nervous tissue.


==== salivary glands ====

there are three sets of salivary glands: the parotid, the submandibular and the sublingual glands. the (exocrine) glands secrete saliva for proper mixing of food and provides enzymes to start chemical digestion. saliva helps to hold together the formed bolus which is swallowed after chewing. saliva is composed primarily of water, ions, salivary amylase, lysozymes, and trace amounts of urea.


==== tongue ====
the tongue is a specialized skeletal muscle that is specially adapted for the activities of speech, chewing, developing gustatory sense (taste) and swallowing. the tongue contains two sets of muscles, the intrinsic- involved with shape of tongue, and the extrinsic- involved with tongue movement. it is attached to the hyoid bone. terms meaning tongue include ""glosso"" (from greek) and ""lingual"" ((from latin).


=== nose ===


=== microanatomy ===
the outer surfaces of the head and neck are lined by epithelium. the protective tissues of the oral cavity are continuous with the digestive tract are called mucosa or mucous membranes. the cells of the inner oral cavity are called the buccal mucosa.
the oral cavity is lined by a stratified squamous epithelium containing about three layers of cells. they line the oral, nasal, and external auditory meatus, (ear), providing lubrication and protection against pathogens. 
the lips are also protected by specialized sensory cells called meissner's corpuscles.


== blood, lymph and nerve supply ==


=== blood supply ===
blood circulates from the upper systemic loop originating at the aortic arch, and includes: the brachiocephalic artery, left common carotid artery and left subclavian artery. the head and neck are emptied of blood by the subclavian vein and jugular vein.

the brachiocephalic artery or trunk is the first and largest artery that branches to form the right common carotid artery and the right subclavian artery. this artery provides blood to the right upper chest, right arm, neck, and head, through a branch called right vertebral artery. the right and left vertebral artery feed into the basilar artery and upward to the posterior cerebral artery, which provides most of the brain with oxygenated blood.
the posterior cerebral artery and the posterior communicating artery are within the circle of willis.
the left common carotid artery divides to form the: internal carotid artery (ica) and an external carotid artery (eca). the ica supplies the brain. the eca supplies the neck and face.
the left subclavian artery and the right subclavian artery, one on each side of the body form the internal thoracic artery, the vertebral artery, the thyrocervical trunk, and the costocervical trunk. the subclavian becomes the axillary artery at the lateral border of the first rib. the left subclavian artery also provides blood to the left upper chest and left arm.


==== blood–brain barrier ====
the blood–brain barrier (bbb) is semi-permeable membrane that controls the capillary leak potential of the circulatory system. in most parts of the body, the smallest blood vessels, called capillaries, are lined with endothelial cells, which have small spaces between each individual cell so substances can move readily between the inside and the outside of the capillary. this is not in the case of brain. in the brain, the endothelial cells fit tightly together to create a tight junction and substances cannot pass out of the bloodstream.
specialized glial cells called astrocytes form a tight junction or protective barrier around brain blood vessels and may be important in the development of the bbb. astrocytes may also be responsible for transporting ions (electrolytes) from the brain to the blood.


=== venous drainage ===
blood from the brain and neck flows from: (1) within the cranium via the internal jugular veins, a continuation of the sigmoid sinuses. the right and left external jugular veins drain from the parotid glands, facial muscles, scalp into the subclavian veins. the right and left vertebral veins drain the vertebrae and muscles into the right subclavian vein and into the superior vena cava, into the right atrium of the heart.


=== lymphatic system ===
the lymphatic system drains the head and neck of excess interstitial fluid via lymph vessels or capillaries, equally into the right lymphatic duct and the thoracic duct.
lymph nodes line the cervical spine and neck regions as well as along the face and jaw.
the tonsils also are lymphatic tissue and help mediate the ingestion of pathogens.
tonsils in humans include, from superior to inferior: nasopharyngeal tonsils (also known as adenoids), palatine tonsils, and lingual tonsils.
together this set of lymphatic tissue is called the tonsillar ring or waldeyer's ring.


=== nerve supply ===
the spinal nerves arise from the spinal column. the top section of the spine is the cervical section, which contains nerves that innervate muscles of the head, neck and thoracic cavity, as well as transmit sensory information to the cns.
the cervical spine section contains seven vertebrae, c-1 through c-7, and eight nerve pairs, c-1 through c-8.
there is the formation of an extensive network of nerve groups or tracts attaching to the spinal cord in arrangements called rami or plexus.
the sensory branches of spinal nerves include: lesser occipital, c-2, great auricular, (c-2 and c-3); transverse cervical, c-2 and c-3; and supraclavicular, c-3 and c-4. these nerve groups transmit afferent (sensory) information from the scalp, neck, and shoulders to the brain.
the motor branches of spinal nerves include: ansa cervicalis, dividing into a superior root, c-1, and an inferior root, c-2 and c-3, and the phrenic nerve, c-3 to c-5, the segmental nerve branches, c-1 to c-5. these nerve groups transmit efferent nerve (motor) information from the brain to muscle groups of the  scalp, neck, diaphragm (anatomy), and shoulders.
additionally there are: (c5-c8, and t1) brachial plexus, providing the entire nerve supply of the shoulder and upper limb; and includes supraclavicular branches (dorsal scapular, suprascapular, long thoracic) lateral cord (musculocutaneous, lateral antibrachial cutaneous, lateral head of median nerve), medial cord (ulnar, medial head of median nerve, medial antibrachial cutaneous, medial brachial cutaneous), posterior cord (axillary, radial), controlling the arm.
damage to a person's spinal cord above c-5 may result in respiratory arrest and death if medicinal aid does not intervene.


==== cranial nerves ====
twelve pairs of cranial nerves emerge from the brain; these affect movements and sensation, and some special organs such as hearing of parts of the head and neck.


== function ==
movements of the neck includes: flexion, extension, (nodding yes),  and rotation (shaking head no).
the mouth has evolved to support chewing, (mastication) and swallowing (deglutition), and speech (phonation).
in addition to the teeth, other structures that aid chewing are the lips, cheeks, tongue, hard palate, soft palate, and floor of the mouth.


=== endocrine glands ===
several glands of the endocrine system are found within the head and neck.  endocrine means that the secretion is used within the body. endocrine glands are termed as ductless and release their secretions directly into the blood. the endocrine system is under the direct supervision of the nervous system, using the negative feedback principal of homeostasis, to create hormones which act as chemical instant messengers.
the hypothalamus connects directly to the pituitary gland, both through the circulatory system and by direct connection of neurons. also, within the cranium, the pineal gland, which attaches to the thalamus, controls the body's 24-hour rhythms circadian rhythm through the release of melatonin.
the pituitary gland secretes hormones that directly impact the body as well as hormones that indirectly control body functions because they activate other endocrine glands, such as the adrenal cortex (acth) and the thyroid gland (tsh). these two glands when stimulated by pituitary hormones then release their own hormones.
the pituitary gland has two lobes, the anterior lobe and the posterior lobe. the anterior lobe secretes: growth hormone (gh), luteinizing hormone (lh), follicle stimulating hormone (fsh), adrenocorticotropic hormone (acth), thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh), prolactin (prl), and the posterior lobe secretes: antidieuretic hormone (adh), and oxytocin. there is an intermediate lobe, in adult humans it is just a thin layer of cells between the anterior and posterior pituitary, nearly indistinguishable from the anterior lobe. the intermediate lobe produces melanocyte-stimulating hormone (msh).
in the neck are the thyroid and parathyroid glands, that secrete hormones that control metabolism and blood calcium levels. the four parathyroid glands are situated upon the back surface of the thyroid gland.


=== respiratory system ===

the respiratory system begins in the head and neck, with air entering and leaving the body through the mouth and nose. the respiratory system involving the head and neck includes:

the nasal cavity for filtering, moistening, and warming the air
the pharynx or throat which is the combining point for respiratory and digestive system
the larynx or voice box containing the epiglottis
the trachea, or windpipethese lead down into the lower respiratory tract. a critical junction between the respiratory and digestive systems is the epiglottis, a cartilage flap  which shuts during swallowing to prevent aspiration. the epiglottis is normally open to support respiration and shuts during swallowing to prevent food and fluids from entering the trachea, activating the gag reflex or initiates the choking mechanism.


=== central nervous system ===

the nervous system is composed of a central nervous system (cns), brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system (pns), cranial nerves and spinal nerves. the cns is located within the dorsal cavity, and the pns extends through the ventral cavity. the central nervous system provides control and coordination of all eleven body systems and utilizes the endocrine system to form hormone chemical messengers that transport through the blood to influence the activity of individual cells of the body and their associated tissues, organs and systems.
the cns receives sensory (afferent) input from the pns and directs the flow of information to association neurons (interneurons) to create chemical synapse responses which in turn cause the formation of motor (efferent nerve) responses to stimulus. association neurons are located in the grey matter of the spinal cord and the brain.
the cns is protected by the cranium, vertebral column, meninges, cerebrospinal fluid. the spinal cord is an extension of the brain. the spinal cord and the brain stem are joined at the base of the cranium at the foramen magnum. most of the functions of the head and neck are directly influenced by the brain and transmitted to the pns via the cranial nerves and spinal nerves of the cervical portion of the spine.
the pns has two subdivisions

somatic nervous system (sns). the sns is associated with the voluntary control of body movements through the action of skeletal muscles, and also the reception of external stimuli.
the autonomic nervous system (ans). the ans is divided into subsystems: the sympathetic nervous system (sns) and the parasympathetic (pns) nervous systems. the sns and pns often have opposing effects in the same organs or physiological systems, and the ans is a major factor in maintaining homeostasis.


== development ==


=== bones ===
the facial bones usually form into pairs and then fuse together. as the cranium fuses, sutures are formed that resemble stitching between bone plates. in a newborn, the junction of the parietal bones with the frontal and occipital bones, form the anterior (front) and posterior (back) fontanelle, or soft spots. the separation of the cranial bone plates at time of birth facilitate passage of the head of the fetus through the mother's birth canal, or pelvic girdle. the parietal bones, and occipital bone can overlap each other in the birth canal, and form the unusual looking ""cone head"" appearance in a newborn when delivered in a natural, or vaginal, delivery.


=== teeth ===
humans normally will produce two sets of teeth called primary dentition, or deciduous teeth, and secondary dentition, or permanent teeth.
a tooth is the toughest known substance in the body exceeding bones in density and strength. tooth enamel lends great strength to the tooth structure.  the formation of a developing tooth includes the process of dentin formation, (see: dentinogenesis) and enamel formation, (see: amelogenesis).  the tooth breaks through the gum into the mouth in a process called eruption. the formation of teeth begins in early fetal development and goes through six stages:

(1) initiation stage, 6th - 7th week
(2) bud stage, 8th wk
(3) cap stage, 9th-10 wk
(4) bell stage, 11th-12th wk
(5) apposition
(6) maturation stage


== clinical significance ==


=== infection ===
severe viral infections that affect the mouth, lips, or the oral cavity include:
oral cancer may have a viral link.

minor viral infections include: mumps is a viral infection of the parotid salivary glands. chicken pox is a viral infection that can spread to the mouth.
thrush (candidiasis) fungal infection. tonsillitis is an inflammation of the tonsils and may cause a sore throat and fever. in chronic cases tonsillectomy may be required.infected teeth can on rare occasions cause infection to spread leading to cavernous sinus thrombosis, mediastinitis, or ludwig's angina causing airway blockage. 
diseases may be transmitted by contact of the head, mouth, or body fluids, such as herpes simplex virus type i (hsv-1), herpes simplex virus type ii (hsv-2) genital herpes, which may present as a lesion on the lips, and contactable via skin to skin contact


=== other ===
other diseases include: gingivitis gum disease, periodontal disease, oral forms of syphilis and gonorrhea. dental caries or dental cavities.
temporomandibular joint diseases and disorders, commonly called tmj.
autoimmune diseases such as: crohn's disease of the oral cavity, see reference below.careful observation of the oral cavity, teeth and gums may reveal indicators of other medical conditions. for example, a person suffering from the eating disorder, bulimia nervosa may show signs of excessive tooth and gum erosion.


=== airway obstruction ===
the airway in the head and neck may be obstructed with swelling associated with an enlarged tongue (macroglossia), tonsils, with swelling associated with anaphylactic shock, angiooedema, or a foreign body.
anaphylactic shock requires advanced medical care immediately; but other first aid measures include rescue breathing (part of cpr) and administration of epinephrine using an epipen for immediate administration of epinephrine (adrenaline) to reverse swelling and to keep the respiratory airway (trachea) open.

actio iniuriarum,non_science,"the actio iniuriarum is an action for delict which ""not only seeks to protect an individual's dignity and reputation but also his or her physical integrity.""


== harm or loss ==
the harm or loss which gives rise to the actio iniuriarum is a violation of a personality interest, usually classified, as per the definition above, under the following three headings:

corpus, or bodily integrity;
dignitas, or dignity; and
fama, or reputation.


== conduct ==
the delictual conduct required for a successful application of the action comes usually in the form of statements or positive conduct. seldom is it an omission.


== causation ==
causation is normally not an issue in respect of the actio iniuriarum, but it may become one in some instances, as in deprivation-of-liberty cases.


== wrongfulness ==
conduct will be wrongful in terms of this action if it is objectively unreasonable and without lawful justification: ""having a valid defence means that the conduct is justified and the behaviour is not wrongful or unlawful.""


== fault ==
there must be fault in the form of intention, although this is controversial, as some in south africa contend that the action has developed in the last century to include some instances, such as those involving deprivation of liberty, where liability is strict, and others such as defamation involving the media, where liability is negligence-based.

list of birds of sri lanka,non_science,"sri lanka is a tropical island situated close to the southern tip of india. the bird life of sri lanka is very rich for its size and 505 species have been recorded. in addition to the many resident birds, a considerable number of migratory species winter in the country to escape their northern breeding grounds.
26 species are confirmed as endemic. the other resident species are also found in the nearby indian mainland, but over 80 have developed distinct sri lankan races. some of these races are very different in their plumage characteristics from the related forms in india. 26 species are globally threatened.
bird distribution in sri lanka is largely determined by its climatic zones. the dry zone is largest of the three, covering more than half of the island, with a prolonged dry and hot period and only one monsoon (the north east monsoon from october to january).
the wet zone, with two monsoons, is in the south western quarter of the island, where the few remaining rain forests are found and humidity is high.
the central hill zone rises to over 2450 m (8-10,000 ft) and has a cool temperate climate. most of the 26 endemic species are confined to the wet and the hill zones, with only a few extending into the dry zone as well.
recent updates and sighting information can be obtained through the field ornithology group of sri lanka website. the following list is prepared according to an illustrated guide to the birds of sri lanka on 2010 by sarath kotagama and gamini ratnavira. supplemental updates follow the clements checklist of birds of the world, 2019 edition.the following tags have been used to highlight several categories. the commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories.

(a) accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in sri lanka
(e) endemic - a species native or restricted to sri lanka
(i) introduced - a species introduced to sri lanka as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions

"cathedral of the holy trinity (new ulm, minnesota)",non_science,"the cathedral of the holy trinity is a roman catholic cathedral in new ulm, minnesota, united states and is the seat of the diocese of new ulm.


== history ==

the catholic presence in new ulm can trace its beginnings to the missionary work of the rev. franz weninger, sj in the middle 19th century.   the first church was a wood structure built in 1858.  construction of the church proved to be slow and it was destroyed by the defenders of new ulm before it was completed so that members of the dakota tribe could not use it as a barricade in the dakota war of 1862.after the conflict was resolved michael lauterbach gave bishop thomas grace two lots for the construction of a church.  the cornerstone for the new church was laid on september 1, 1866.  the rev. alexander berghold was assigned as the first resident priest at new ulm in 1868.  the new church, which measured 36 x 97 feet, was dedicated by bishop grace on december 11, 1870.  the structure was destroyed by a tornado on july 15, 1881.  fundraising for a new church was completed by september 1888.
a.c. ochs signed a contract to build the present church on march 29, 1890, and the cornerstone was laid on may 4, 1890.  the steeple was completed in 1893 and the interior decorations were finished in 1903.  the wall decorations of the baroque style building are of numerous saints, angels and the life of christ painted in dark colors and accented in gold leaf.  an apse features an image of the holy trinity with the twelve apostles.  alexander schwendinger was commissioned to decorate the interior and he was assisted by christ heller and anton gag.  the two side entrances to the church were added in 1940 as was the terrazzo floor.
the diocese of new ulm was established by pope pius xii on november 18, 1957.   holy trinity was named as the diocese’s new cathedral.  the msgr. alphonse schladweiler of st. paul was named the first bishop of new ulm and was consecrated in holy trinity.
another renovation of the cathedral was completed in 1987.  the lower level of the church was renovated into a community hall and named in honor of a former pastor, msgr. antony leifeld.

notochordal cell,cell,"in anatomy, the notochord is a flexible rod formed of a material similar to cartilage. if a species has a notochord at any stage of its life cycle, it is, by definition, a chordate. the notochord lies along the anteroposterior (""front to back"") axis, is usually closer to the dorsal than the ventral surface of the animal, and is composed of cells derived from the mesoderm.
the most commonly cited functions of the notochord are: as a midline tissue that provides directional signals to surrounding tissue during development, as a site of muscle attachment, and as a vertebral precursor.in lancelets the notochord persists throughout life as the main structural support of the body. in tunicates the notochord is present only in the larval stage, being completely absent in the adult animal. in vertebrates the notochord develops into the vertebral column, becoming vertebrae and the intervertebral discs the center of which retains a structure similar to the original notochord.


== structure ==
the notochord is a long, rodlike structure that develops dorsal to the gut and ventral to the neural tube. the notochord is composed primarily of a core of glycoproteins, encased in a sheath of collagen fibers wound into two opposing helices. the glycoproteins are stored in vacuolated, turgid cells. the angle between these fibers determines whether increased pressure in the core will result in shortening and thickening versus lengthening and thinning.contraction of these muscle fibers result in a side-to-side motion resembling swimming. the stiffened notochord prevents movement through telescoping motion, such as that of an earthworm.


== role in signaling & development ==
the notochord plays a key role in signaling and coordinating development. embryos of modern vertebrates form transient notochord structures during gastrulation. the notochord is found ventral to the neural tube.
notogenesis is the development of the notochord by  epiblasts that form the floor of the amnion cavity. the progenitor notochord is derived from cells migrating from the primitive node and pit. the notochord forms during gastrulation and soon after induces the formation of the neural plate (neurulation), synchronizing the development of the neural tube. on the ventral aspect of the neural groove an axial thickening of the endoderm takes place. (in bipedal chordates, e.g. humans, this surface is properly referred to as the anterior surface). this thickening appears as a furrow (the chordal furrow) the margins of which anastomose (come into contact), and so convert it into a solid rod of polygonal-shaped cells (the notochord) which is then separated from the endoderm.in vertebrates, it extends throughout the entire length of the future vertebral column, and reaches as far as the anterior end of the midbrain, where it ends in a hook-like extremity in the region of the future dorsum sellae of the sphenoid bone. initially, it exists between the neural tube and the endoderm of the yolk-sac; soon, the notochord becomes separated from them by the mesoderm, which grows medially and surrounds it. from the mesoderm surrounding the neural tube and notochord, the skull, vertebral column, and the membranes of the brain and medulla spinalis are developed. because it originates from the primitive node and is ultimately positioned with the mesodermal space, it is considered to be derived from mesoderm.a postembryonic vestige of the notochord is found in the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs. isolated notochordal remnants may escape their lineage-specific destination in the nucleus pulposus and instead attach to the outer surfaces of the vertebral bodies, from which notochordal cells largely regress.


=== in amphibians and fish ===
during development of amphibians and fish, the notochord induces development of the hypochord through secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor. the hypochord is a transient structure ventral to the notochord, and is primarily responsible for correct development of the dorsal aorta.


=== in humans ===
by the age of 4, all notochord residue is replaced by a population of chondrocyte-like cells of unclear origin. persistence of notochordal cells within the vertebra may cause a pathologic condition: persistent notochordal canal. if the notochord and the nasopharynx do not separate properly during embryonic development, a depression (tornwaldt bursa) or tornwaldt cyst may form. the cells are the likely precursors to a rare cancer called chordoma.


== neurology ==
research into the notochord has played a key role in understanding the development of the central nervous system. by transplanting and expressing a second notochord near the dorsal neural tube, 180 degrees opposite of the normal notochord location, one can induce the formation of motor neurons in the dorsal tube. motor neuron formation generally occurs in the ventral neural tube, while the dorsal tube generally forms sensory cells.the notochord secretes a protein called sonic hedgehog (shh), a key morphogen regulating organogenesis and having a critical role in signaling the development of motor neurons. the secretion of shh by the notochord establishes the ventral pole of the dorsal-ventral axis in the developing embryo.


== evolution in chordates ==

the notochord is the defining feature (synapomorphy) of chordates, and was present throughout life in many of the earliest chordates. although the stomochord of hemichordates was once thought to be homologous, it is now viewed as a convergence. pikaia appears to have a proto-notochord, and notochords are present in several basal chordates such as haikouella, haikouichthys, and myllokunmingia, all from the cambrian.
the ordovician oceans included many diverse species of agnatha and early gnathostomata which possessed notochords, either with attached bony elements or without, most notably the conodonts, placoderms, and ostracoderms. even after the evolution of the vertebral column in chondrichthyes and osteichthyes, these taxa remained common and are well represented in the fossils record. several species (see list below) have reverted to the primitive state, retaining the notochord into adulthood, though the reasons for this are not well understood.
scenarios for the evolutionary origin of the notochord were comprehensively reviewed by annona, holland, and d'aniello (2015). they point out that, although many of these ideas have not been well supported by advances in molecular phylogenetics and developmental genetics, two of them have actually been revived under the stimulus of modern molecular approaches (the first proposes that the notochord evolved de novo in chordates, and the second derives it from a homologous structure, the axochord, that was present in annelid-like ancestors of the chordates). deciding between these two scenarios (or possibly another yet to be proposed) should be facilitated by much more thorough studies of gene regulatory networks in a wide spectrum of animals.


=== post-embryonic retention ===
in most vertebrates, the notochord develops into secondary structures. in other chordates, the notochord is retained as an essential anatomical structure. the evolution of the notochord within the phylum chordata is considered in detail by holland and somorjai (2020). the following organisms retain a post-embryonic notochord:

acipenseriformes (paddlefish and sturgeon)
lancelet (amphioxus)
tunicate (larval stage only)
hagfish
lamprey
coelacanth
african lungfish
tadpoles
ostracoderms (extinct)


=== within amphioxus ===
the notochord of the lancelet protrudes beyond the anterior end of the neural tube. this projection serves a second purpose in allowing the animal to burrow within the sediment of shallow waters. there, amphioxus is a filter feeder and spends most of its life partially submerged within the sediment.

annexin a8 isoform 1 (mouse),protein,"annexin a2 also known as annexin ii is a protein that in humans is encoded by the anxa2 gene.annexin 2 is involved in diverse cellular processes such as cell motility (especially that of the epithelial cells), linkage of membrane-associated protein complexes to the actin cytoskeleton, endocytosis, fibrinolysis, ion channel formation, and cell matrix interactions.
it is a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein whose function is to help organize exocytosis of intracellular proteins to the extracellular domain. annexin ii is a pleiotropic protein meaning that its function is dependent on place and time in the body.


== gene ==
the anxa2 gene, located  at 15q22.2, has three pseudogenes located on chromosomes 4, 9 and 10, respectively. multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.


== function ==
this protein is a member of the annexin family. members of this calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein family play a role in the regulation of cellular growth and in signal transduction pathways. this protein functions as an autocrine factor which heightens osteoclast formation and bone resorption. epigenetic regulation of annexin a2 has been identified as a key determinant of mesenchymal transformation in brain tumors.annexin a2 has been proposed to function inside the cell in sorting of endosomes and outside the cell in anticoagulant reactions.


== interactions ==
annexin a2 has been shown to interact with prohibitin, ceacam1, s100a10, pcna, complement factor h, and a number of viral factors including the hpv16 minor capsid protein l2.

moxifloxacin,antibiotic,"moxifloxacin is an antibiotic used to treat a number of bacterial infections. this includes pneumonia, conjunctivitis, endocarditis, tuberculosis, and sinusitis. it is used by mouth, by injection into a vein, or as an eye drop.common side effects include diarrhea, dizziness, and headache. severe side effects may include spontaneous tendon ruptures, nerve damage, and worsening of myasthenia gravis. safety of use in pregnancy or breastfeeding is unclear. moxifloxacin is in the fluoroquinolone family of medications. it usually results in bacterial death through blocking their ability to duplicate dna.moxifloxacin was patented in 1988 and approved for use in the united states in 1999. it is on the world health organization's list of essential medicines.


== medical uses ==
moxifloxacin is used to treat a number of infections, including: respiratory tract infections, cellulitis, anthrax, intra-abdominal infections, endocarditis, meningitis, and tuberculosis.in the united states, moxifloxacin is licensed for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, community acquired pneumonia, complicated and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, and complicated intra-abdominal infections. in the european union, it is licensed for acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, non-severe community-acquired pneumonia, and acute bacterial sinusitis. based on its investigation into reports of rare but severe cases of liver toxicity and skin reactions, the european medicines agency recommended in 2008 that the use of the by mouth (but not the iv) form of moxifloxacin be restricted to infections in which other antibacterial agents cannot be used or have failed. in the us, the marketing approval does not contain these restrictions, though the label contains prominent warnings against skin reactions.
the initial approval by the fda (december 1999) encompassed these indications:

acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis
acute bacterial sinusitis
community acquired pneumoniaadditional indications approved by the fda are:

april 2001: uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections
may 2004: community acquired pneumonia caused by multidrug resistant streptococcus pneumoniae
june 2005: complicated skin and skin structure infections
november 2005: complicated intra-abdominal infectionsthe european medicines agency has advised that for pneumonia, acute bacterial sinusitis, and acute exacerbations of copd, it should only be used when other antibiotics are inappropriate.no uses within the pediatric population for oral and intravenous moxifloxacin have been approved. a significant number of drugs found within this class, including moxifloxacin, are not licensed by the fda for use in children due to the risk of permanent injury to the musculoskeletal system.moxifloxacin is approved for the treatment of conjunctival infections caused by susceptible bacteria.


=== susceptible bacteria ===
a broad spectrum of bacteria is susceptible, including:

staphylococcus aureus
staphylococcus epidermidis
streptococcus pneumoniae
haemophilus influenzae
klebsiella spp.
moraxella catarrhalis
enterobacter spp.

exposure of the developing fetus to quinolones, including levofloxacin, during the first-trimester is not associated with an increased risk of stillbirths, premature births, birth defects, or low birth weight. there is limited data about the appearance of moxifloxacin in human breastmilk. animal studies have found that moxifloxacin appears in significant concentration in breastmilk. decisions as to whether to continue therapy during pregnancy or while breast feeding should take the potential risk of harm to the fetus or child into account, as well as the importance of the drug to the well-being of the mother.


== contraindications ==
only two listed contraindications are found within the 2008 package insert:

""nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids): although not observed with moxifloxacin in preclinical and clinical trials, the concomitant administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with a fluoroquinolone may increase the risks of cns stimulation and convulsions.""
""moxifloxacin is contraindicated in persons with a history of hypersensitivity to moxifloxacin, any member of the quinolone class of antimicrobial agents, or any of the product components.""though not stated as such within the package insert, ziprasidone is also considered to be contraindicated, as it may have the potential to prolong qt interval. moxifloxacin should also be avoided in patients with uncorrected hypokalemia, or concurrent administration of other medications known to prolong the qt interval (antipsychotics and tricyclic antidepressants).moxifloxacin should be used with caution in patients suffering from diabetes, as glucose regulation may be significantly altered.moxifloxacin is also considered to be contraindicated within the pediatric population, pregnancy, nursing mothers, patients with a history of tendon disorder, patients with documented qt prolongation, and patients with epilepsy or other seizure disorders. coadministration of moxifloxacin with other drugs that also prolong the qt interval or induce bradycardia (e.g., beta-blockers, amiodarone) should be avoided. careful consideration should be given in the use of moxifloxacin in patients with cardiovascular disease, including those with conduction abnormalities.


=== pediatric population ===
the safety of moxifloxacin in children under age 18 has not been established. animal studies suggest the potential for musculoskeletal harm in juveniles.


== interactions ==
moxifloxacin is not believed to be associated with clinically significant drug interactions due to inhibition or stimulation of hepatic metabolism. thus, it should not, for the most part, require special clinical or laboratory monitoring to ensure its safety. moxifloxacin has a potential for a serious drug interaction with nsaids.the combination of corticosteroids and moxifloxacin has increased potential to result in tendonitis and disability.antacids containing aluminium or magnesium ions inhibit the absorption of moxifloxacin. drugs that prolong the qt interval (e.g., pimozide) may have an additive effect on qt prolongation and lead to increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias. the international normalised ratio may be increased or decreased in patients treated with warfarin.


== overdose ==
""in the event of acute overdose, the stomach should be emptied and adequate hydration maintained. ecg monitoring is recommended due to the possibility of qt interval prolongation. the patient should be carefully observed and given supportive treatment. the administration of activated charcoal as soon as possible after oral overdose may prevent excessive increase of systemic moxifloxacin exposure. about 3% and 9% of the dose of moxifloxacin, as well as about 2% and 4.5% of its glucuronide metabolite are removed by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis, respectively."" (quoting from 29 december 2008 package insert for avelox)


== pharmacology ==


=== mechanism of action ===
moxifloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. it functions by inhibiting dna gyrase, a type ii topoisomerase, and topoisomerase iv, enzymes necessary to separate bacterial dna, thereby inhibiting cell replication.


=== pharmacokinetics ===
about 52% of an oral or intravenous dose of moxifloxacin is metabolized via glucuronide and sulfate conjugation. the cytochrome p450 system is not involved in moxifloxacin metabolism, and is not affected by moxifloxacin. the sulfate conjugate (m1) accounts for around 38% of the dose, and is eliminated primarily in the feces. approximately 14% of an oral or intravenous dose is converted to a glucuronide conjugate (m2), which is excreted exclusively in the urine. peak plasma concentrations of m2 are about 40% those of the parent drug, while plasma concentrations of m1 are, in general, less than 10% those of moxifloxacin.in vitro studies with cytochrome (cyp) p450 enzymes indicate that moxifloxacin does not inhibit 80 cyp3a4, cyp2d6, cyp2c9, cyp2c19, or cyp1a2, suggesting that moxifloxacin is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized by these enzymes.the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin in pediatric subjects have not been studied.the elimination half-life of moxifloxacin is 11.5 to 15.6 hours (single-dose, oral). about 45% of an oral or intravenous dose of moxifloxacin is excreted as unchanged drug (about 20% in urine and 25% in feces). a total of 96 ± 4% of an oral dose is excreted as either unchanged drug or known metabolites. the mean (± sd) apparent total body clearance and renal clearance are 12 ± 2 l/h and 2.6 ± 0.5 l/h, respectively. the csf penetration of moxifloxacin is 70% to 80% in patients with meningitis.


== chemistry ==
moxifloxacin monohydrochloride is a slightly yellow to yellow crystalline substance. it is synthesized in several steps, the first involving the preparation of racemic 2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]nonane which is then resolved using tartaric acid.  a suitably derivatised quinolinecarboxylic acid is then introduced, in the presence of dabco, followed by acidification to form moxifloxacin hydrochloride.


== history ==
moxifloxacin was first patented (united states patent) in 1991 by bayer a.g., and again in 1997. avelox was subsequently approved by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) for use in the united states in 1999 to treat specific bacterial infections. ranking 140th within the top 200 prescribed drugs in the united states for 2007, avelox generated sales of $697.3 million worldwide.moxifloxacin is also manufactured by alcon as vigamox.


=== patent ===
a united states patent application was made on 30 june 1989, for avelox, bayer a.g. being the assignee, which was subsequently approved on 5 february 1991. this patent was scheduled to expire on 30 june 2009. however, this patent was extended for an additional two and one half years on 16 september 2004, and as such was not expected to expire until 2012.
moxifloxacin was subsequently (ten years later) approved by the fda for use in the united states in 1999. at least four additional united states patents have been filed regarding moxifloxacin hydrochloride since the 1989 united states application, as well as patents outside of the usa.


== society and culture ==


=== regulatory actions ===
regulatory agencies have taken actions to address certain rare but serious adverse events associated with moxifloxacin therapy.
based on its investigation into reports of rare but severe cases of liver toxicity and skin reactions, the european medicines agency recommended in 2008 that the use of the oral (but not the iv) form of moxifloxacin be restricted to infections in which other antibacterial agents cannot be used or have failed. similarly, the canadian label includes a warning of the risk of liver injury.the u.s. label does not contain restrictions similar to the european label, but a carries a ""black box"" warning of the risk of tendon damage and/or rupture and warnings regarding the risk of irreversible peripheral neuropathy.


=== generic equivalents ===
in 2007, the u.s. district court for the district of delaware held that two bayer patents on avelox are valid and enforceable, and infringed by dr. reddy's anda for a generic version of avelox. the district court sided with bayer, citing the federal circuit's prior decision in takeda v. alphapharm as ""affirming the district court's finding that defendant failed to prove a prima facie case of obviousness where the prior art disclosed a broad selection of compounds, any one of which could have been selected as a lead compound for further investigation, and defendant did not prove that the prior art would have led to the selection of the particular compound singled out by defendant."" according to bayer's press release announcing the court's decision, it was noted that teva had also challenged the validity of the same bayer patents at issue in the dr. reddy's case. within bayer's first-quarter 2008 stockholder's newsletter bayer stated that they had reached an agreement with teva pharmaceuticals usa, inc., the adverse party, to settle their patent litigation with regard to the two bayer patents. under the settlement terms agreed upon, teva would obtain a license to sell its generic moxifloxacin tablet product in the u.s. shortly before the second of the two bayer patents expires in march 2014.  in bangladesh, it is available with brand name of optimox.

probable atp-dependent rna helicase dhx40,protein,"probable atp-dependent rna helicase dhx58 also known as rig-i-like receptor 3 (rlr-3) or rig-i-like receptor lgp2 (rlr) is a rig-i-like receptor dsrna helicase enzyme that in humans is encoded by the dhx58 gene.  the protein encoded by the gene dhx58 is known as lgp2 (laboratory of genetics and physiology 2).


== structure and function ==
lgp2 was first identified and characterized in the context of mammary tissue in 2001, but its function has been found to be more relevant to the field of innate antiviral immunity. lgp2 has been found to be essential for producing effective antiviral responses against many viruses that are recognized by rig-i and mda5.since lgp2 lacks card domains, its effect on downstream antiviral signaling is likely due to interaction with dsrna viral ligand or the other rlrs (rig-i and mda5).lgp2 has been shown to directly interact with rig-i through its c-terminal repressor domain (rd).  the primary contact sites in this interaction is likely between the rd of lgp2 and the card or helicase domain of rig-i as it is seen with rig-i self-association, but this has not been confirmed.  the helicase activity of lgp2 has been found to be essential for its positive regulation of rig-i signaling.  overexpression of lgp2 is able to inhibit rig-i-mediated antiviral signaling both in the presence and absence of viral ligands. this inhibition of rig-i signaling is not dependent upon the ability of lgp2 to bind viral ligands and is therefore not due to ligand competition. although lgp2 binds to dsrna with higher affinity, it is dispensable for rig-i-mediated recognition of synthetic dsrna ligands.  rig-i, when overexpressed and in lgp2 knock-down studies, has been shown to induce antiviral response in the absence of viral ligand.

"dengue virus live antigen, cyd serotype 1 / dengue virus live antigen, cyd serotype 2 / dengue virus live antigen, cyd serotype 3 / dengue virus live antigen, cyd serotype 4 injection",drug,"dengue virus (denv) is the cause of dengue fever. it is a mosquito-borne, single positive-stranded rna virus of the family flaviviridae; genus flavivirus.  five serotypes of the virus have been found, all of which can cause the full spectrum of disease. nevertheless, scientists' understanding of dengue virus may be simplistic, as rather than distinct antigenic groups, a continuum appears to exist.  this same study identified 47 strains of dengue virus.  additionally, coinfection with and lack of rapid tests for zika virus and chikungunya complicate matters in real-world infections.dengue virus has increased dramatically within the last 20 years, becoming one of the worst mosquito-borne human pathogens with which  tropical countries have to deal. current estimates indicate that as many as 390 million infections occur each year, and  many dengue infections are increasingly understood to be asymptomatic or subclinical.


== evolution ==
based on the analysis of the envelope protein,  at least three genotypes (1 to 3) are known. in 2013, a fourth serotype was reported. the rate of nucleotide substitution for this virus has been estimated to be 6.5×10−4 per nucleotide per year, a rate similar to other rna viruses. the american african genotype has been estimated to have evolved between 1907 and 1949. this period includes world war i and world war ii, which were associated with considerable movement of populations and environmental disturbance, factors known to promote the evolution of new vector-borne viral species.
a bayesian analysis of all four serotypes estimated that their most recent common ancestor existed about 340 ad (95% confidence interval: 280 bc-850 ad).


== lifecycle ==
until a few hundred years ago, dengue virus was transmitted in sylvatic cycles in africa, southeast asia and south asia between mosquitoes of the genus aedes and nonhuman primates, with rare emergences into human populations. the global spread of dengue virus, however, has followed its emergence from sylvatic cycles and the primary lifecycle now exclusively involves transmission between humans and aedes mosquitoes. vertical transmission from mosquito to mosquito has also been observed in some vector species. dogs have been found to be infected by the virus, but more research is needed to determine if dogs or other animals can serve as reservoirs or are just incidental hosts.recent findings suggest that as the virus infects human cells, host homeostatic processes such as autophagy and er stress response, not to mention apoptosis, are triggered depending on the infected cell type. the activation of autophagy and er stress during infection enhances virus reproduction. attempts to provide detailed summaries of the life cycle of dengue at the cellular level are published in review articles from different research groups.


== genome ==
the denv genome is about 11000 bases of positive-sense, single stranded rna (ssrna) that codes for three structural proteins (capsid protein c, membrane protein m, envelope protein e) and seven nonstructural proteins (ns1, ns2a, ns2b, ns3, ns4a, ns4b, ns5). it also includes short noncoding regions on both the 5' and 3' ends.


== structural and enzymatic proteins ==


=== e protein ===
the denv e (envelope) protein, found as a dimer on the surface of the mature viral particle, is important in the initial attachment of this particle to the host cell. each e protein monomer comprises three ectodomains, ed1 to ed3, and a transmembrane segment. ed2 includes the dimerization interface, two glycosylation sites, and the peptide of fusion with the cellular membrane. ed3 is a continuous polypeptide segment; its fold is compact and immunoglobulin-like. dengue virus is transmitted by species of the mosquito genus aedes. several molecules that interact with the viral e protein (icam3-grabbing nonintegrin, cd209, rab 5, grp 78, and the mannose receptor) have been shown to be important factors mediating attachment and viral entry. the membrane form of ribosomal protein sa may also be involved in the attachment. recombinant domains of the e protein are used as well-defined antigens in the serological detection of antibodies directed against dengue virus and as immunogens in vaccine candidates.


=== prm/m protein ===
the denv prm (membrane) protein, which is important in the formation and maturation of the viral particle, consists of seven antiparallel β-strands stabilized by three disulfide bonds.the glycoprotein shell of the mature denv virion consists of 180 copies each of the e and m proteins. the immature virion starts out with the e and prm proteins forming 90 heterodimers that give a spiky exterior to the viral particle. this immature viral particle buds into the endoplasmic reticulum and eventually travels via the secretory pathway to the golgi apparatus. as the virion passes through the trans-golgi network,  it is exposed to low ph. this acidic environment causes a conformational change in the e protein, which disassociates it from the prm protein and causes it to form e homodimers, which lie flat against the viral surface, giving the maturing virion a smooth appearance. during this maturation, pr peptide is cleaved from the m peptide by the host protease, furin. the m protein then acts as a transmembrane protein under the e-protein shell of the mature virion. the pr peptide stays associated with the e protein until the viral particle is released into the extracellular environment. this pr peptide acts like a cap, covering the hydrophobic fusion loop of the e protein until the viral particle has exited the cell.


=== ns3 protein ===
the denv ns3 is a serine protease, as well as an rna helicase and rtpase/ntpase. the protease domain consists of six β-strands arranged into two β-barrels formed by residues 1–180 of the protein. the catalytic triad (his-51, asp-75 and ser-135) is found between these two β-barrels, and activity is dependent on the presence of a 43 amino acid segment of the ns2b cofactor. this cofactor wraps around the ns3 protease domain and becomes part of the active site. the remaining ns2b residues before and after the cofactor region contain helical domains involved in membrane binding. the remaining ns3 residues (180–618) form the three subdomains of the denv helicase. a six-stranded parallel β-sheet surrounded by four α-helices makes up subdomains i and ii, and subdomain iii is composed of four α-helices surrounded by three shorter α-helices and two antiparallel β-strands.


=== ns4a protein ===
denv ns4a is a nonstructural protein involved in altering cell membrane curvature and induction of autophagy. in addition to its membrane altering property, ns4a is a scaffold for the virus replication complex and undergoes oligomerization. mutations of ns4a that affect interaction with ns4b abolished or severely reduced virus replication indicating the importance of ns4a and its interaction with ns4b in dengue reproduction. also, ns4a from four of the five serotypes of dengue all induce autophagy and protect infected cells from toxins via the atm pathway, suggesting a conserved function for the protein among dengue viruses.


=== ns5 protein ===
the denv ns5 protein is a 900-residue peptide with a methyltransferase domain at its n-terminal end (residues 1–296) and a rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) at its c-terminal end (residues 320–900). the methyltransferase domain consists of an α/β/β sandwich flanked by n-and c-terminal subdomains. the denv rdrp is similar to other rdrps containing palm, finger, and thumb subdomains and a gdd motif for incorporating nucleotides.


=== complexes between the e protein and neutralizing antibodies ===
crystal structures of complexes between antibodies and either the ectodomain (se) of the viral e protein or its domain 3 (ed3) have helped understand the molecular bases of the virus recognition and neutralization. some of the epitopes are partially or totally inaccessible in the known structure of the mature virion. the corresponding antibodies are, therefore, assumed to bind to alternate or transitional conformations of the virus at 37 °c.

the murine antibody e111 neutralizes denv1. its fab and scfv fragments were crystallized in complex with the ed3 domain of denv1. its epitope is located around β-strands c and c' of ed3, and the intervening loop.
the murine antibody 1a1d-2 strongly neutralizes denv1, denv2, and denv3. its fab fragment was crystallized in complex with the ed3 domain of denv2. its epitope straddles β-strands a and g of ed3.
the murine antibody 2h12 cross-reacts with all four denv serotypes. it neutralizes the corresponding viruses, except denv2. its fab fragment was crystallized in complex with the ed3 domains of denv1, denv3 and denv4. its epitope is located around the conserved ab loop of ed3.
the murine antibody 4e11 neutralizes all four denv serotypes with varying efficacies. its scfv fragment was crystallized in complex with the ed3 domains of the four denv serotypes. its epitope straddles β-strands a and g of ed3 as does the epitope of 1a1d-2. the structures at 2.0 å resolution have enabled one to analyze the roles of water molecules within the protein interfaces and the roles of somatic hypermutations outside of these interfaces in the interactions and cross-recognitions.
the chimpanzee antibody 5h2 potently neutralizes denv4. its fab fragment was crystallized in complex with the se protein of denv4. its epitope is included in domain 1 (ed1) of the e protein.
the human antibodies ede1-c10, ede2-a11, and ede2-b7 potently neutralize all four denv serotypes. their fab or scfv fragments were crystallized in complex with the se protein of denv2. the recognition determinants of these antibodies are at a serotype-invariant site in the e dimer interface and include the exposed side chains of the e fusion loop and the two conserved glycan side-chains.


== disease ==

common names for dengue fever include breakbone fever, vomiting and dandy fever; dengue hemorrhagic fever  and dengue shock syndrome  are the severe forms. dengue is found in tropical and subtropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semiurban areas. people of all ages who are exposed to infected mosquitoes are possible victims of dengue fever. the disease occurs most often during the rainy season in tropical countries in southeast asia, south asia and south america, with high numbers of infected mosquitoes. the virus is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female mosquitoes, though humans are not capable of transmitting the disease and are not contagious. the incubation period is 3 to 14 days, while the period of the illness is 3–7 days. signs and symptoms may include severe headache; retro-orbital pain; muscle, joint, and bone pain; macular or maculopapular rash; and minor hemorrhagic manifestations, including petechiae, ecchymosis, purpura, epistaxis, bleeding gums, hematuria, or a positive tourniquet test result. a recent systematic review and meta-analysis showed that allergic symptoms are one of the core symptoms that are highly associated with dengue severity.


== mechanism of infection ==
dengue virus’ (denv) e envelope protein binds to a cellular receptor. the exact nature of the cellular receptor has not been fully elucidated.
denv undergoes endocytosis. acidification of the endosome leads to a conformational change of e, exposing a fusion peptide sequence that facilitates fusion of the envelope with the endosomal membrane, releasing the virion capsid into the cytoplasm.
uncoating occurs in the cytoplasm
host translational machinery (ribosomes) translates the (+)ssrna into a single polypeptide
cellular and viral proteinases cleave the polypeptide into 10 proteins (e, m, c and 7 nonstructural/enzymatic proteins) while embedded on the er membrane.
as soon as functional rna-dependent rna polymerase is synthesized, rna replication can commence. synthesis is asymmetrical, making 10 times more of the positive-sense strand than the negative.
assembly occurs on intracellular membranes, which bud into the er (forming the envelope from the er membrane). subsequent budding from the er through the golgi and into vesicles allows maturation via posttranslational modifications, e.g. glycosylation and ph transformational rearrangements
egress occurs via exocytosis


=== severe disease ===

some people suffer from more severe forms of dengue, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever. different strains of viruses interacting with people with different immune backgrounds lead to a complex interaction. among the possible causes are cross-serotypic immune response, through a mechanism known as antibody-dependent enhancement, which happens when a person who has been previously infected with dengue gets infected for the second, third, or fourth time. the previous antibodies to the old strain of dengue virus now interfere with the immune response to the current strain, leading paradoxically to more virus entry and uptake.


== immune system interaction ==

in recent years, many studies have shown that flaviviruses, especially dengue virus, has the ability to inhibit the innate immune response during the infection.
indeed, dengue virus has many nonstructural proteins that allow the inhibition of various mediators of the innate immune system response. these proteins act on two levels :


=== inhibition of interferon signaling by blocking signal transducer ===
ns4b is a small, hydrophobic protein located in association with the endoplasmic reticulum. it may block the phosphorylation of stat 1 after induction by interferons type i alpha & beta. in fact, as the activity of tyk2 kinase decreases in association with dengue virus, so too does stat 1 phosphorylation.  furthermore, the innate immune system's response to the virus is further damped as expression of interferon-stimulating gene(s) (isg) is restricted by the aforementioned 'ns4b' protein. ns2a and ns4a cofactor may also take part in the stat 1 inhibition.ns5 - the presence of this 105-kda protein results in inactivation of stat2 (via the signal transduction of the response to interferon) when it is expressed alone. when ns5 is cleaved with ns4b by a protease (ns2b3), it can degrade stat2. in fact, after the cleavage of ns5 by the protease,  an e3 ligase association with stat2 occurs, and the e3 ligase targets stat2 for the degradation.


=== inhibition of the type i interferon response ===
ns2b3-b protease complex is a proteolytic core consisting of the last 40 amino acids of ns2b and the first 180 amino acids of ns3. 
cleavage of the ns2b3 precursor activates the protease complex.this protease complex allows the inhibition of the production of type i interferon by reducing the activity of ifn-beta promoter; ns2b3 protease complex is involved in inhibiting the phosphorylation of irf3.
the ns2b3 protease complex inhibits (by cleaving) protein mita which allows the irf3 activation.


=== mosquito d7 saliva protein ===
dengue virus is transmitted by the mosquito species aedes aegypti, which produces saliva that contains over 100 unique proteins, including the protein family d7. scientists used to believe that a. aegypti saliva, when being transmitted, actually enhanced dengue virus in the body. the mosquito's saliva was thought to make the virus spread faster due to the weakened immune response of its host. however, a current study has found that the protein d7 hinders the virus transmission into the host cells.the immune responses of antibodies that are trying to fight off the foreign virus actually increase transmission and make the infection worse. levels of protein d7 are more prevalent in salivary glands of dengue-infected mosquitoes compared to those uninfected ones. d7 is found in mosquito saliva and was thought to assist the process of blood feeding. despite the prior assumptions, d7 can modulate the host cell and act against the virus to prevent viral infection. unfortunately, d7 proteins provoke immune responses, which raise anti-d7 antibody levels. these antibodies inhibit the function of d7 proteins, which enhance transmission of dengue virus. although immune responses against d7 proteins might impair their antiviral activity, a study showed that non-denv subjects have slightly higher anti-d7 igg levels than infected ones, although it was not statistically significant. thus, more studies over d7 protein family are needed do elucidate its role on denv infection and its applicability in medicine.


=== vaccine research ===

only one vaccine for dengue is currently approved in 11 countries (mexico, the philippines, indonesia, brazil, el salvador, costa rica, paraguay, guatemala, peru, thailand, and singapore). several vaccines are under development by private and public researchers. developing a vaccine against the disease is challenging. with four different serotypes of the  virus that can cause the disease, the vaccine must immunize against all four types to be effective. vaccination against only one serotype could possibly lead to severe dengue hemorrhagic shock when infected with another serotype due to antibody-dependent enhancement. when infected with dengue virus, the immune system produces cross-reactive antibodies that provide immunity to that particular serotype.  however, these antibodies are incapable of neutralizing other serotypes upon reinfection and actually increase viral replication. when macrophages consume the ‘neutralized’ virus, the virus is able to replicate within the macrophage, causing disease. these cross-reactive, ineffective antibodies ease access of virus into macrophages, which induces more severe disease (dengue hemorrhagic fever, dengue shock syndrome). a common problem faced in dengue-endemic regions is when mothers become infected with dengue; after giving birth, offspring carry the immunity from their mother and are susceptible to hemorrhagic fever if infected with any of the other three serotypes. one vaccine was in phase iii trials in 2012 and planning for vaccine usage and effectiveness surveillance had started.in 2009, sanofi-pasteur started building a new facility in neuville-sur-saône' (fr), a suburb of lyon (france). this unit produces four-serotype vaccine for phase iii trials. in september 2014, the sanofi-pasteur ceo gave early results of the phase iii trial efficacy study in latin america. the efficacy per serotype (st) varied widely, 42.3% for st2, 50.3% for st1, 74.0% for st3, and 77.7% for st4. the full analysis of data from the phase iii latin american-caribbean study will be reviewed by external experts before being published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. primary results has to be presented at the american society of tropical medicine and hygiene annual meeting, held november 2–6, 2014, in new orleans.in september 2012,  one of the vaccines was reported to not have done well in clinical trials.in late 2015 and early 2016, the first dengue vaccine, dengvaxia (cyd-tdv) by sanofi-pasteur, was registered in several countries for use in individuals 9–45 years of age living in endemic areas.
on may 1, 2019, the u.s. food and drug administration announced the approval of dengvaxia, the first vaccine for the prevention of dengue disease caused by all dengue virus serotypes in people ages 9 through 16 who have laboratory-confirmed previous dengue infection and who live in endemic areas. dengue is endemic in the u.s. territories of american samoa, guam, puerto rico, and the u.s. virgin islands.


=== drug research ===
there are no approved direct antiviral treatments for dengue fever. most antiviral drug research for dengue infections has focussed on inhibition of the ns2b/ns3 protease or ns5 proteins. one drug, balapiravir, a repurposed hepatitis c ns5 polymerase inhibitor progressed to a phase ii clinical trial before being stopped due to lack of efficacy.

daptomycin resistant mprf,antibiotic,"antimicrobial peptides (amps), also called host defense peptides (hdps) are part of the innate immune response found among all classes of life. fundamental differences exist between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells that may represent targets for antimicrobial peptides. these peptides are potent, broad spectrum antibiotics which demonstrate potential as novel therapeutic agents. antimicrobial peptides have been demonstrated to kill gram negative and gram positive bacteria, enveloped viruses, fungi and even transformed or cancerous cells. unlike the majority of conventional antibiotics it appears that antimicrobial peptides frequently destabilize biological membranes, can form transmembrane channels, and may also have the ability to enhance immunity by functioning as immunomodulators.


== structure ==

antimicrobial peptides are a unique and diverse group of molecules, which are divided into subgroups on the basis of their amino acid composition and structure. antimicrobial peptides are generally between 12 and 50 amino acids. these peptides include two or more positively charged residues provided by arginine, lysine or, in acidic environments, histidine, and a large proportion (generally >50%) of hydrophobic residues. the secondary structures of these molecules follow 4 themes, including i) α-helical, ii) β-stranded due to the presence of 2 or more disulfide bonds, iii) β-hairpin or loop due to the presence of a single disulfide bond and/or cyclization of the peptide chain, and iv) extended. many of these peptides are unstructured in free solution, and fold into their final configuration upon partitioning into biological membranes. it contains hydrophilic amino acid residues aligned along one side and hydrophobic amino acid residues aligned along the opposite side of a helical molecule. this amphipathicity of the antimicrobial peptides allows them to partition into the membrane lipid bilayer. the ability to associate with membranes is a definitive feature of antimicrobial peptides, although membrane permeabilization is not necessary. these peptides have a variety of antimicrobial activities ranging from membrane permeabilization to action on a range of cytoplasmic targets.

the modes of action by which antimicrobial peptides kill microbes are varied, and may differ for different bacterial species. some antimicrobial peptides kill both bacteria and fungi, e.g., psoriasin kills e. coli and several filamentous fungi. the cytoplasmic membrane is a frequent target, but peptides may also interfere with dna and protein synthesis, protein folding, and cell wall synthesis. the initial contact between the peptide and the target organism is electrostatic, as most bacterial surfaces are anionic, or hydrophobic, such as in the antimicrobial peptide piscidin. their amino acid composition, amphipathicity, cationic charge and size allow them to attach to and insert into membrane bilayers to form pores by ‘barrel-stave’, ‘carpet’ or ‘toroidal-pore’ mechanisms. alternately, they may penetrate into the cell to bind intracellular molecules which are crucial to cell living. intracellular binding models includes inhibition of cell wall synthesis, alteration of the cytoplasmic membrane, activation of autolysin, inhibition of dna, rna, and protein synthesis, and inhibition of certain enzymes. however, in many cases, the exact mechanism of killing is not known. one emerging technique for the study of such mechanisms is dual polarisation interferometry. in contrast to many conventional antibiotics these peptides appear to be bactericidal instead of bacteriostatic. in general the antimicrobial activity of these peptides is determined by measuring the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic), which is the lowest concentration of drug that inhibits bacterial growth.amps can possess multiple activities including anti-gram-positive bacterial, anti-gram-negative bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-viral, anti-parasitic, and anti cancer activities. a big amp functional analysis indicates that among all amp activities, amphipathicity and charge, two major properties of amps, best distinguish between amps with and without anti-gram-negative bacterial activities. this implies that being amps with anti-gram-negative bacterial activities may prefer or even require strong amphipathicity and net positive charge.


== immunomodulation ==
in addition to killing bacteria directly they have been demonstrated to have a number of immunomodulatory functions that may be involved in the clearance of infection, including the ability to alter host gene expression, act as chemokines and/or induce chemokine production, inhibiting lipopolysaccharide induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production, promoting wound healing, and modulating the responses of dendritic cells and cells of the adaptive immune response. animal models indicate that host defense peptides are crucial for both prevention and clearance of infection. it appears as though many peptides initially isolated as and termed ""antimicrobial peptides"" have been shown to have more significant alternative functions in vivo (e.g. hepcidin). dusquetide for example is an immunomodulator that acts through p62, a protein involved in toll like receptor based signalling of infection. the peptide is being examined in a phase iii clinical trial by soligenix (sgnx) to ascertain if it can assist in repair of radiation-induced damage to oral mucosa arising during cancer radiotherapy of the head and neck.


== mechanisms of action ==

antimicrobial peptides possessing a net positive charge are attracted and incorporated into negatively charged bacterial membranes. once inside the membrane, they are believed to cause disruption through three possible mechanisms:

toroidal pore formation
carpet formation
barrel stave formationalthough the specifics of each mechanism differ, all propose peptide-induced membrane rupture, allowing cytoplasmic leakage that ultimately leads to death.
recent work has painted a more complex picture of antimicrobial peptide activity. antimicrobial peptides may also function as metabolic inhibitors, inhibitors of dna, rna, and protein synthesis, and inhibitors of cell wall synthesis or septum formation. they are also known to cause ribosomal aggregation and delocalize membrane proteins.
adding a further layer of complexity, many natural antimicrobial peptides possess weak bactericidal activity. rather than directly inhibit bacterial growth, they are now known to act in concert with the host immune system through mechanisms including chemokine induction, histamine release, and angiogenesis modulation. these immunomodulatory effects have only recently begun to receive attention.
several methods have been used to determine the mechanisms of antimicrobial peptide activity. in particular, solid-state nmr studies have provided an atomic-level resolution explanation of membrane disruption by antimicrobial peptides. in more recent years, x-ray crystallography has been used to delineate in atomic detail how the family of plant defensins rupture membranes by identifying key phospholipids in the cell membranes of the pathogen. human defensins have been thought to act through a similar mechanism, targeting cell membrane lipids as part of their function. in fact human beta-defensin 2 have now been shown to kill the pathogenic fungi candida albicans through interactions with specific phospholipids. from the computational point of view, the molecular dynamics simulations can shed light in the molecular mechanism and the specific peptide interactions with lipids, ions and solvent.


== therapeutic research and use ==
antimicrobial peptides have been used as therapeutic agents; their use is generally limited to intravenous administration or topical applications due to their short half-lives. as of january 2018 the following antimicrobial peptides were in clinical use:
bacitracin for pneumonia, topical
boceprevir, hepatitis c (oral, cyclic peptide)
dalbavancin, bacterial infections, iv
daptomycin, bacterial infections, iv
enfuvirtide, hiv, subcutaneous injection
oritavancin, bacterial infections, iv
teicoplanin, bacterial infections, iv
telaprevir, hepatitis c, oral cyclic peptide
telavancin, bacterial infection, iv
vancomycin, bacterial infection, iv.
guavanin 2, bacterial infection against gram-positive and gram-negative also.


=== activity beyond antibacterial functions ===
amps have been observed having functions other than bacterial and fungal killing. these activities include antiviral effects, but also roles in host defence such as anticancer functions and roles in neurology. this has led to a movement for re-branding amps as ""host-defence peptides"" to encompass the broad scope of activities amps can have.


==== anticancer properties ====
some cecropins (e.g. cecropin a, and cecropin b) have anticancer properties and are called anticancer peptides (acps). hybrid acps based on cecropin a have been studied for anticancer properties. the fruit fly defensin prevents tumour growth, suspected to bind to tumour cells owing to cell membrane modifications common to most cancer cells, such as phosphatidylserine exposure.


== antibiofilm properties ==
cecropin a can destroy planktonic and sessile biofilm-forming uropathogenic e. coli (upec) cells, either alone or when combined with the antibiotic nalidixic acid, synergistically clearing infection in vivo (in the insect host galleria mellonella) without off-target cytotoxicity. the multi-target mechanism of action involves outer membrane permeabilization followed by biofilm disruption triggered by the inhibition of efflux pump activity and interactions with extracellular and intracellular nucleic acids.


=== other research ===
recently there has been some research to identify potential antimicrobial peptides from prokaryotes, aquatic organisms such as fish, and shellfish, and monotremes such as echidnas.


== selectivity ==
in the competition of bacterial cells and host cells with the antimicrobial peptides, antimicrobial peptides will preferentially interact with the bacterial cell to the mammalian cells, which enables them to kill microorganisms without being significantly toxic to mammalian cells. selectivity is a very important feature of the antimicrobial peptides and it can guarantee their function as antibiotics in host defense systems.
with regard to cancer cells, they themselves also secrete human antimicrobial peptides including defensin, and in some cases, they are reported to be more resistant than the surrounding normal cells.
therefore, we cannot conclude that selectivity is always high against cancer cells.


=== factors ===
there are some factors that are closely related to the selectivity property of antimicrobial peptides, among which the cationic property contributes most. since the surface of the bacterial membranes is more negatively charged than mammalian cells, antimicrobial peptides will show different affinities towards the bacterial membranes and mammalian cell membranes.in addition, there are also other factors that will affect the selectivity. it's well known that cholesterol is normally widely distributed in the mammalian cell membranes as a membrane stabilizing agents but absent in bacterial cell membranes; and the presence of these cholesterols will also generally reduce the activities of the antimicrobial peptides, due either to stabilization of the lipid bilayer or to interactions between cholesterol and the peptide. so the cholesterol in mammalian cells will protect the cells from attack by the antimicrobial peptides.besides, the transmembrane potential is well known to affect peptide-lipid interactions. there's an inside-negative transmembrane potential existing from the outer leaflet to the inner leaflet of the cell membranes and this inside-negative transmembrane potential will facilitate membrane permeabilization probably by facilitating the insertion of positively charged peptides into membranes. by comparison, the transmembrane potential of bacterial cells is more negative than that of normal mammalian cells, so bacterial membrane will be prone to be attacked by the positively charged antimicrobial peptides.
similarly, it is also believed that increasing ionic strength, which in general reduces the activity of most antimicrobial peptides, contributes partially to the selectivity of the antimicrobial peptides by weakening the electrostatic interactions required for the initial interaction.


=== mechanism ===
the cell membranes of bacteria are rich in acidic phospholipids, such as phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin. these phospholipid headgroups are heavily negatively charged. therefore, the outmost leaflets of the bilayer which is exposed to the outside of the bacterial membranes are more attractive to the attack of the positively charged antimicrobial peptides. so the interaction between the positive charges of antimicrobial peptides and the negatively charged bacterial membranes is mainly the electrostatic interactions, which is the major driving force for cellular association. in addition, since antimicrobial peptides form structures with a positively charged face as well as a hydrophobic face, there are also some hydrophobic interactions between the hydrophobic regions of the antimicrobial peptides and the zwitterionic phospholipids (electrically neutral) surface of the bacterial membranes, which act only as a minor effect in this case.
in contrast, the outer part of the membranes of plants and mammals is mainly composed of lipids without any net charges since most of the lipids with negatively charged headgroups are principally sequestered into the inner leaflet of the plasma membranes. thus in the case of mammalian cells, the outer surfaces of the membranes are usually made of zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, even though a small portion of the membrane's outer surfaces contain some negatively charged gangliosides. therefore, the hydrophobic interaction between the hydrophobic face of amphipathic antimicrobial peptides and the zwitterionic phospholipids on the cell surface of mammalian cell membranes plays a major role in the formation of peptide-cell binding. however, the hydrophobic interaction is relatively weak when compared to the electrostatic interaction, thus, the antimicrobial peptides will preferentially interact with bacterial membranes.dual polarisation interferometry has been used in vitro to study and quantify the association to headgroup, insertion into the bilayer, pore formation and eventual disruption of the membrane.


=== control ===
a lot of effort has been put into controlling cell selectivity. for example, attempts have been made to modify and optimize the physicochemical parameters of the peptides to control the selectivities, including net charge, helicity, hydrophobicity per residue (h), hydrophobic moment (μ) and the angle subtended by the positively charged polar helix face (φ). other mechanisms like the introduction of d-amino acids and fluorinated amino acids in the hydrophobic phase are believed to break the secondary structure and thus reduce hydrophobic interaction with mammalian cells. it has also been found that pro→nlys substitution in pro-containing β-turn antimicrobial peptides was a promising strategy for the design of new small bacterial cell-selective antimicrobial peptides with intracellular mechanisms of action. it has been suggested that direct attachment of magainin to the substrate surface decreased nonspecific cell binding and led to improved detection limit for bacterial cells such as salmonella and e. coli.


== bacterial resistance ==
bacteria use various resistance strategies to avoid antimicrobial peptide killing. some microorganisms alter net surface charges. staphylococcus aureus transports d-alanine from the cytoplasm to the surface teichoic acid which reduces the net negative charge by introducing basic amino groups. s. aureus also modifies its anionic membranes via mprf with l-lysine, increasing the positive net charge. the interaction of antimicrobial peptides with membrane targets can be limited by capsule polysaccharide of klebsiella pneumoniae. 
alterations occur in lipid a. salmonella species reduce the fluidity of their outer membrane by increasing hydrophobic interactions between an increased number of lipid a acyl tails by adding myristate to lipid a with 2-hydroxymyristate and forming hepta-acylated lipid a by adding palmitate. the increased hydrophobic moment is thought to retard or abolish antimicrobial peptide insertion and pore formation. the residues undergo alteration in membrane proteins. in some gram-negative bacteria, alteration in the production of outer membrane proteins correlates with resistance to killing by antimicrobial peptides. non-typeable hemophilus influenzae transports amps into the interior of the cell, where they are degraded. furthermore, h. influenzae remodels its membranes to make it appear as if the bacterium has already been successfully attacked by amps, protecting it from being attacked by more amps. atp-binding cassette transporters import antimicrobial peptides and the resistance-nodulation cell-division efflux pump exports antimicrobial peptides. both transporters have been associated with antimicrobial peptide resistance. bacteria produce proteolytic enzymes, which may degrade antimicrobial peptides leading to their resistance. outer membrane vesicles produced by gram-negative bacteria bind the antimicrobial peptides and sequester them away from the cells, thereby protecting the cells. the outer membrane vesicles are also known to contain various proteases, peptidases and other lytic enzymes, which may have a role in degrading the extracellular peptide and nucleic acid molecules, which if allowed to reach to the bacterial cells may be dangerous for the cells. cyclic-di-gmp signaling had also been involved in the regulation of antimicrobial peptide resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosawhile these examples show that resistance can evolve naturally, there is increasing concern that using pharmaceutical copies of antimicrobial peptides can make resistance happen more often and faster. in some cases, resistance to these peptides used as a pharmaceutical to treat medical problems can lead to resistance, not only to the medical application of the peptides, but to the physiological function of those peptides.the ‘trojan horse’ approach to solving this problem capitalizes on the innate need for iron by pathogens. “smuggling” antimicrobials into the pathogen is accomplished by linking them to siderophores for transport. while simple in concept, it has taken many decades of work to accomplish the difficult hurdle of transporting antimicrobials across the cell membranes of pathogens. lessons learned from the successes and failures of siderophore-conjugate drugs evaluated during the development of novel agents using the ‘trojan horse’ approach have been reviewed.


== examples ==

antimicrobial peptides are produced by species across the tree of life, including: 

bacteria (e.g. bacteriocin, and many others)
fungi (e.g. peptaibols, plectasin, and many others)
cnidaria (e.g. hydramacin, aurelin)
many from insects and arthropods (e.g. cecropin, attacin, melittin, mastoparan, drosomycin)
amphibia, frogs (magainin, dermaseptin, aurein, and others)
birds (e.g. avian defensins)
and mammals (e.g. cathelicidins, alpha- and beta-defensins, regiii peptides)research has increased in recent years to develop artificially-engineered mimics of antimicrobial peptides such as snapps, in part due to the prohibitive cost of producing naturally-derived amps. an example of this is the facially cationic peptide c18g, which was designed from the c-terminal domain of human platelet factor iv. currently, the most widely used antimicrobial peptide is nisin; being the only fda approved antimicrobial peptide, it is commonly used as an artificial preservative.


== bioinformatics ==
several bioinformatic databases exist to catalogue antimicrobial peptides such as adam (a database of anti-microbial peptides), apd (antimicrobial peptide database), biopd (biologically active peptide database), camp (collection of sequences and structures of antimicrobial peptides), dbaasp (database of antimicrobial activity and structure of peptides) and lamp (linking amps).
the antimicrobial peptide databases may be divided into two categories on the basis of the source of peptides it contains, as specific databases and general databases. these databases have various tools for antimicrobial peptides analysis and prediction. for example, camp contains amp prediction, feature calculator, blast search, clustalw, vast, pratt, helical wheel etc. in addition, adam allows users to search or browse through amp sequence-structure relationships. antimicrobial peptides often encompass a wide range of categories such as antifungal, antibacterial, and antituberculosis peptides.
dbamp: provides an online platform for exploring antimicrobial peptides with functional activities and physicochemical properties on transcriptome and proteome data. dbamp is an online resource that addresses various topics such as annotations of antimicrobial peptides (amps) including sequence information, antimicrobial activities, post-translational modifications (ptms), structural visualization, antimicrobial potency, target species with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), physicochemical properties, or amp–protein interactions.
tools such as peptideranker, peptidelocator, and antimpmod allow for the prediction of antimicrobial peptides while others have been developed to predict antifungal and anti-tuberculosis activities.

alemtuzumab injection,drug,"alemtuzumab is a medication used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll) and multiple sclerosis. in cll has been used as both a first line and second line treatment. in ms it is generally only recommended if other treatments have not worked. it is given by injection into a vein.it is a monoclonal antibody that binds to cd52, a protein present on the surface of mature lymphocytes, but not on the stem cells from which these lymphocytes are derived. after treatment with alemtuzumab, these cd52-bearing lymphocytes are targeted for destruction.
alemtuzumab was approved for medical use in the united states in 2001. (mab)campath was withdrawn from the markets in the us and europe in 2012 to prepare for a higher-priced relaunch of lemtrada aimed at multiple sclerosis.


== medical uses ==


=== chronic lymphocytic leukemia ===
alemtuzumab is used for the treatment of b-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (b-cll) in people who have been treated with alkylating agents and who have failed fludarabine therapy. it is an unconjugated antibody, thought to work via the activation of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (adcc).


=== multiple sclerosis ===
it is used for the relapsing remitting form of multiple sclerosis. a 2017 cochrane meta-analysis of studies comparing alemtuzumab to interferon beta 1a concluded that annual cycles of alemtuzumab probably reduces the proportion of people that experience relapse and may reduce the proportion of people who experience disability worsening and new t2 lesions on mri, with adverse events found to be similarly high for both treatments. however the low-to-moderate levels of evidence in the included, existing studies were noted and the need for larger high-quality randomised, double‐blind, controlled trials comparing mono or combination therapy with alemtuzumab was highlighted. it is generally only recommended in people do not respond sufficiently to at least two other ms medications.


== contraindications ==
alemtuzumab is contraindicated in patients who have active systemic infections, underlying immunodeficiency (e.g., seropositive for hiv), or known type i hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions to the substance.


== adverse effects ==
in november 2018, the us food and drug administration (fda) issued a safety announcement warning about rare but serious instances of stroke and blood vessel wall tears in multiple sclerosis patients who have received lemtrada (alemtuzumab), mostly occurring within 1 day of initiating treatment and leading in some cases to permanent disability and even death.
in addition to the 13 cases to which the fda safety announcement refers, a further 5 cases of spontaneous intracranial haemorrhage have been retrospectively identified from four us multiple sclerosis centres in correspondence published online in february 2019.on 12 april 2019, the pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee (prac) of the european medicines agency (ema) reported that it has started a review of the multiple sclerosis medicine lemtrada (alemtuzumab) following new reports of immune-mediated conditions and of problems with the heart and blood vessels with this medicine, including fatal cases. prac advised that while the review is ongoing, lemtrada should only be started in adults with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis that is highly active despite treatment with at least two disease-modifying therapies (a type of multiple sclerosis medicine) or where other disease-modifying therapies cannot be used. prac further advised that patients being treated with lemtrada who are benefitting from it may continue treatment in consultation with their doctor.very common adverse reactions associated with alemtuzumab infusion in ms patients include upper respiratory tract and urinary tract infections, herpes virus infections, lymphopenia, leucopenia, changes in thyroid function, tachycardia, skin rashes, pruritus, pyrexia, and fatigue. the summary of product characteristics provided in the electronic medicines compendium [emc ] further lists common and uncommon adverse reactions that have been reported for lemtrada, which include serious opportunistic nocardial infections and cytomegalovirus syndrome.alemtuzumab can also precipitate autoimmune disease through the suppression of regulatory t cell populations and/or the emergence of autoreactive b-cells.cases of multiple sclerosis reactivation/relapse have also been reported


== biochemical properties ==
alemtuzumab is a recombinant dna-derived humanized igg1 kappa monoclonal antibody that is directed against the 21–28 kda cell surface glycoprotein cd52.


=== antiviral properties ===
in an in-vitro experiment, it has been shown that alemtuzumab has antiviral properties against hiv-1.


== history ==
the origins of alemtuzumab date back to campath-1 which was derived from the rat antibodies raised against human lymphocyte proteins by herman waldmann and colleagues in 1983. the name ""campath"" derives from the pathology department of cambridge university.
initially, campath-1 was not ideal for therapy because patients could, in theory, react against the foreign rat protein determinants of the antibody. to circumvent this problem, greg winter and his colleagues humanised campath-1, by extracting the hypervariable loops that had specificity for cd52 and grafting them onto a human antibody framework. this became known as campath-1h and serves as the basis for alemtuzumab.while alemtuzumab started life as a laboratory tool for understanding the immune system, within a short time it was clinically investigated for use to improve the success of bone marrow transplants and as a treatment for leukaemia, lymphoma, vasculitis, organ transplants, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.campath as medication was first approved for b-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 2001. it is marketed by genzyme, which acquired the worldwide rights from bayer ag in 2009. genzyme was bought by sanofi in 2011. in august/september 2012 campath was withdrawn from the markets in the us and europe. this was done to prevent off-label use of the drug to treat multiple sclerosis and to prepare for a relaunch under the trade name lemtrada, with a different dosage aimed at multiple sclerosis treatment, this is expected to be much higher-priced.bayer reserves the right to co-promote lemtrada for 5 years, with the option to renew for an additional five years.


=== sanofi acquisition and change of license controversy ===
in february 2011, sanofi-aventis, since renamed sanofi, acquired genzyme, the manufacturer of alemtuzumab.  the acquisition was delayed by a dispute between the two companies regarding the value of alemtuzumab.  the dispute was settled by the issuance of contingent value rights, a type of stock warrant which pays a dividend only if alemtuzumab reaches certain sales targets.  the contingent value rights (cvr) trade on the nasdaq-gm market with the ticker symbol gcvrz.
in august 2012, genzyme surrendered the licence for all presentations of alemtuzumab, pending regulatory approval to re-introduce it as a treatment for multiple sclerosis. concerns that genzyme would later bring to market the same product at a much higher price proved correct.


== research and off-label use ==


=== graft-versus-host disease ===
a 2009 retrospective study of alemtuzumab (10 mg iv weekly) in 20 patients (no controls) with severe steroid-resistant acute intestinal graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (hsct) demonstrated improvement. overall response rate was 70%, with complete response in 35%. in this study, the median survival was 280 days.  important complications following this treatment included cytomegalovirus reactivation, bacterial infection, and invasive aspergillosis infection.

from laboratory to clinic: the story of campath-1 (geoff hale and herman waldmann)"
protein fam84a isoform 1 (mouse),protein,"catenin beta-1, also known as β-catenin, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ctnnb1 gene.
β-catenin is a dual function protein, involved in regulation and coordination of cell–cell adhesion and gene transcription. in humans, the ctnnb1 protein is encoded by the ctnnb1 gene. in drosophila, the homologous protein is called armadillo. β-catenin is a subunit of the cadherin protein complex and acts as an intracellular signal transducer in the wnt signaling pathway. it is a member of the catenin protein family and homologous to γ-catenin, also known as plakoglobin. beta-catenin is widely expressed in many tissues. in cardiac muscle, beta-catenin localizes to adherens junctions in intercalated disc structures, which are critical for electrical and mechanical coupling between adjacent cardiomyocytes.
mutations and overexpression of β-catenin are associated with many cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, lung cancer, malignant breast tumors, ovarian and endometrial cancer. alterations in the localization and expression levels of beta-catenin have been associated with various forms of heart disease, including dilated cardiomyopathy. β-catenin is regulated and destroyed by the beta-catenin destruction complex, and in particular by the adenomatous polyposis coli (apc) protein, encoded by the tumour-suppressing apc gene. therefore, genetic mutation of the apc gene is also strongly linked to cancers, and in particular colorectal cancer resulting from familial adenomatous polyposis (fap).


== discovery ==
beta-catenin was initially discovered in the early 1990s as a component of a mammalian cell adhesion complex: a protein responsible for cytoplasmatic anchoring of cadherins. but very soon, it was realized that the drosophila protein armadillo – implicated in mediating the morphogenic effects of wingless/wnt – is homologous to the mammalian β-catenin, not just in structure but also in function. thus beta-catenin became one of the first examples of moonlighting: a protein performing more than one radically different cellular function.


== structure ==


=== protein structure ===
the core of beta-catenin consists of several very characteristic repeats, each approximately 40 amino acids long. termed armadillo repeats, all these elements fold together into a single, rigid protein domain with an elongated shape – called armadillo (arm) domain. an average armadillo repeat is composed of three alpha helices. the first repeat of β-catenin (near the n-terminus) is slightly different from the others – as it has an elongated helix with a kink, formed by the fusion of helices 1 and 2. due to the complex shape of individual repeats, the whole arm domain is not a straight rod: it possesses a slight curvature, so that an outer (convex) and an inner (concave) surface is formed. this inner surface serves as a ligand-binding site for the various interaction partners of the arm domains.

the segments n-terminal and far c-terminal to the arm domain do not adopt any structure in solution by themselves. yet these intrinsically disordered regions play a crucial role in beta-catenin function. the n-terminal disordered region contains a conserved short linear motif responsible for binding of trcp1 (also known as β-trcp) e3 ubiquitin ligase – but only when it is phosphorylated. degradation of β-catenin is thus mediated by this n-terminal segment. the c-terminal region, on the other hand, is a strong transactivator when recruited onto dna. this segment is not fully disordered: part of the c-terminal extension forms a stable helix that packs against the arm domain, but may also engage separate binding partners. this small structural element (helixc) caps the c-terminal end of the arm domain, shielding its hydrophobic residues. helixc is not necessary for beta-catenin to function in cell–cell adhesion. on the other hand, it is required for wnt signaling: possibly to recruit various coactivators, such as 14-3-3zeta. yet its exact partners among the general transcription complexes are still incompletely understood, and they likely involve tissue-specific players. notably, the c-terminal segment of β-catenin can mimic the effects of the entire wnt pathway if artificially fused to the dna binding domain of lef1 transcription factor.plakoglobin (also called gamma-catenin) has a strikingly similar architecture to that of beta-catenin. not only their arm domains resemble each other in both architecture and ligand binding capacity, but the n-terminal β-trcp-binding motif is also conserved in plakoglobin, implying common ancestry and shared regulation with β-catenin. however, plakoglobin is a very weak transactivator when bound to dna – this is probably caused by the divergence of their c-terminal sequences (plakoglobin appears to lack the transactivator motifs, and thus inhibits the wnt pathway target genes instead of activating them).

as sketched above, the arm domain of beta-catenin acts as a platform to which specific linear motifs may bind. located in structurally diverse partners, the β-catenin binding motifs are typically disordered on their own, and typically adopt a rigid structure upon arm domain engagement – as seen for short linear motifs. however, β-catenin interacting motifs also have a number of peculiar characteristics. first, they might reach or even surpass the length of 30 amino acids in length, and contact the arm domain on an excessively large surface area. another unusual feature of these motifs is their frequently high degree of phosphorylation. such ser/thr phosphorylation events greatly enhance the binding of many β-catenin associating motifs to the arm domain.the structure of beta-catenin in complex with the catenin binding domain of the transcriptional transactivation partner tcf provided the initial structural roadmap of how many binding partners of beta-catenin may form interactions.  this structure demonstrated how the otherwise disordered n-terminus of tcf adapted what appeared to be a rigid conformation, with the binding motif spanning many beta-catenin repeats.  relatively strong charged interaction ""hot spots"" were defined (predicted, and later verified, to be conserved for the beta-catenin/e-cadherin interaction), as well as hydrophobic regions deemed important in the overall mode of binding and as potential therapeutic small molecule inhibitor targets against certain cancer forms.  furthermore, following studies demonstrated another peculiar characteristic, plasticity in the binding of the tcf n-terminus to beta-catenin.similarly, we find the familiar e-cadherin, whose cytoplasmatic tail contacts the arm domain in the same canonical fashion. the scaffold protein axin (two closely related paralogs, axin 1 and axin 2) contains a similar interaction motif on its long, disordered middle segment. although one molecule of axin only contains a single β-catenin recruitment motif, its partner the adenomatous polyposis coli (apc) protein contains 11 such motifs in tandem arrangement per protomer, thus capable to interact with several β-catenin molecules at once.  since the surface of the arm domain can typically accommodate only one peptide motif at any given time, all these proteins compete for the same cellular pool of β-catenin molecules. this competition is the key to understand how the wnt signaling pathway works.
however, this ""main"" binding site on the arm domain β-catenin is by no means the only one. the first helices of the arm domain form an additional, special protein-protein interaction pocket: this can accommodate a helix-forming linear motif found in the coactivator bcl9 (or the closely related bcl9l) – an important protein involved in wnt signaling. although the precise details are much less clear, it appears that the same site is used by alpha-catenin when beta-catenin is localized to the adherens junctions. because this pocket is distinct from the arm domain's ""main"" binding site, there is no competition between alpha-catenin and e-cadherin or between tcf1 and bcl9, respectively. on the other hand, bcl9 and bcl9l must compete with α-catenin to access β-catenin molecules.


== function ==


=== regulation of degradation through phosphorylation ===
the cellular level of beta-catenin is mostly controlled by its ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. the e3 ubiquitin ligase trcp1 (also known as β-trcp) can recognize β-catenin as its substrate through a short linear motif on the disordered n-terminus. however, this motif (asp-ser-gly-ile-his-ser) of β-catenin needs to be phosphorylated on the two serines in order to be capable to bind β-trcp. phosphorylation of the motif is performed by glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha and beta (gsk3α and gsk3β). gsk3s are constitutively active enzymes implicated in several important regulatory processes. there is one requirement, though: substrates of gsk3 need to be pre-phosphorylated four amino acids downstream (c-terminally) of the actual target site. thus it also requires a ""priming kinase"" for its activities. in the case of beta-catenin, the most important priming kinase is casein kinase i (cki). once a serin-threonine rich substrate has been ""primed"", gsk3 can ""walk"" across it from c-terminal to n-terminal direction, phosphorylating every 4th serine or threonine residues in a row. this process will result in dual phosphorylation of the aforementioned β-trcp recognition motif as well.


=== the beta-catenin destruction complex ===
for gsk3 to be a highly effective kinase on a substrate, pre-phosphorylation is not enough. there is one additional requirement: similar to the mitogen-activated protein kinases (mapks), substrates need to associate with this enzyme through high-affinity docking motifs. beta-catenin contains no such motifs, but a special protein does: axin. what is more, its gsk3 docking motif is directly adjacent to a β-catenin binding motif. this way, axin acts as a true scaffold protein, bringing an enzyme (gsk3) together with its substrate (β-catenin) into close physical proximity.

but even axin does not act alone. through its n-terminal regulator of g-protein signaling (rgs) domain, it recruits the adenomatous polyposis coli (apc) protein. apc is like a huge ""christmas tree"": with a multitude of β-catenin binding motifs (one apc molecule alone possesses 11 such motifs ), it may collect as many β-catenin molecules as possible. apc can interact with multiple axin molecules at the same time as it has three samp motifs (ser-ala-met-pro) to bind the rgs domains found in axin. in addition, axin also has the potential to oligomerize through its c-terminal dix domain. the result is a huge, multimeric protein assembly dedicated to β-catenin phosphorylation. this complex is usually called the beta-catenin destruction complex, although it is distinct from the proteosome machinery actually responsible for β-catenin degradation. it only marks β-catenin molecules for subsequent destruction.


=== wnt signaling and the regulation of destruction ===
in resting cells, axin molecules oligomerize with each other through their c-terminal dix domains, which have two binding interfaces. thus they can build linear oligomers or even polymers inside the cytoplasm of cells. dix domains are unique: the only other proteins known to have a dix domain are dishevelled and dixdc1. (the single dsh protein of drosophila corresponds to three paralogous genes, dvl1, dvl2 and dvl3 in mammals.) dsh associates with the cytoplasmic regions of frizzled receptors with its pdz and dep domains. when a wnt molecule binds to frizzled, it induces a poorly known cascade of events, that result in the exposure of dishevelled's dix domain and the creation of a perfect binding site for axin. axin is then titrated away from its oligomeric assemblies – the β-catenin destruction complex – by dsh. once bound to the receptor complex, axin will be rendered incompetent for β-catenin binding and gsk3 activity. importantly, the cytoplasmic segments of the frizzled-associated lrp5 and lrp6 proteins contain gsk3 pseudo-substrate sequences (pro-pro-pro-ser-pro-x-ser), appropriately ""primed"" (pre-phosphorylated) by cki, as if it were a true substrate of gsk3. these false target sites greatly inhibit gsk3 activity in a competitive manner.  this way receptor-bound axin will abolish mediating the phosphorylation of β-catenin. since beta-catenin is no longer marked for destruction, but continues to be produced, its concentration will increase. once β-catenin levels rise high enough to saturate all binding sites in the cytoplasm, it will also translocate into the nucleus. upon engaging the transcription factors lef1, tcf1, tcf2 or tcf3, β-catenin forces them to disengage their previous partners: groucho proteins. unlike groucho, that recruit transcriptional repressors (e.g. histone-lysine methyltransferases), beta-catenin will bind transcriptional activators, switching on target genes.


=== role in cell–cell adhesion ===

cell–cell adhesion complexes are essential for the formation of complex animal tissues. β-catenin is part of a protein complex that form adherens junctions. these cell–cell adhesion complexes are necessary for the creation and maintenance of epithelial cell layers and barriers. as a component of the complex, β-catenin can regulate cell growth and adhesion between cells. it may also be responsible for transmitting the contact inhibition signal that causes cells to stop dividing once the epithelial sheet is complete. the e-cadherin – β-catenin – α-catenin complex is weakly associated to actin filaments. adherens junctions require significant protein dynamics in order to link to the actin cytoskeleton,
thereby enabling mechanotransduction.an important component of the adherens junctions are the cadherin proteins. cadherins form the cell–cell junctional structures known as adherens junctions as well as the desmosomes. cadherins are capable of homophilic interactions through their extracellular cadherin repeat domains, in a ca2+-dependent manner; this can hold adjacent epithelial cells together. while in the adherens junction, cadherins recruit β-catenin molecules onto their intracellular regions. β-catenin, in turn, associates with another highly dynamic protein, α-catenin, which directly binds to the actin filaments. this is possible because α-catenin and cadherins bind at distinct sites to β-catenin. the β-catenin – α-catenin complex can thus physically form a bridge between cadherins and the actin cytoskeleton. organization of the cadherin–catenin complex is additionally regulated through phosphorylation and endocytosis of its components.


=== roles in development ===
beta-catenin has a central role in directing several developmental processes, as it can directly bind transcription factors and be regulated by a diffusible extracellular substance: wnt. it acts upon early embryos to induce entire body regions, as well as individual cells in later stages of development. it also regulates physiological regeneration processes.


==== early embryonic patterning ====
wnt signaling and beta-catenin dependent gene expression plays a critical role during the formation of different body regions in the early embryo. experimentally modified embryos that do not express this protein will fail to develop mesoderm and initiate gastrulation. during the blastula and gastrula stages, wnt as well as bmp and fgf pathways will induce the antero-posterior axis formation, regulate the precise placement of the primitive streak (gastrulation and mesoderm formation) as well as the process of neurulation (central nervous system development).in xenopus oocytes, β-catenin is initially equally localized to all regions of the egg, but it is targeted for ubiquitination and degradation by the β-catenin destruction complex. fertilization of the egg causes a rotation of the outer cortical layers, moving clusters of the frizzled and dsh proteins closer to the equatorial region. β-catenin will be enriched locally under the influence of wnt signaling pathway in the cells that inherit this portion of the cytoplasm. it will eventually translocate to the nucleus to bind tcf3 in order to activate several genes that induce dorsal cell characteristics. this signaling results in a region of cells known as the grey crescent, which is a classical organizer of embryonic development. if this region is surgically removed from the embryo, gastrulation does not occur at all. β-catenin also plays a crucial role in the induction of the blastopore lip, which in turn initiates gastrulation. inhibition of gsk-3 translation by injection of antisense mrna may cause a second blastopore and a superfluous body axis to form. a similar effect can result from the overexpression of β-catenin.


==== asymmetric cell division ====
beta-catenin has also been implicated in regulation of cell fates through asymmetric cell division in the model organism c. elegans. similarly to the xenopus oocytes, this is essentially the result of non-equal distribution of dsh, frizzled, axin and apc in the cytoplasm of the mother cell.


==== stem cell renewal ====
one of the most important results of wnt signaling and the elevated level of beta-catenin in certain cell types is the maintenance of pluripotency. in other cell types and developmental stages, β-catenin may promote differentiation, especially towards mesodermal cell lineages.


==== epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ====
beta-catenin also acts as a morphogen in later stages of embryonic development. together with tgf-β, an important role of β-catenin is to induce a morphogenic change in epithelial cells. it induces them to abandon their tight adhesion and assume a more mobile and loosely associated mesenchymal phenotype. during this process, epithelial cells lose expression of proteins like e-cadherin, zonula occludens 1 (zo1), and cytokeratin. at the same time they turn on the expression of vimentin, alpha smooth muscle actin (acta2), and fibroblast-specific protein 1 (fsp1). they also produce extracellular matrix components, such as type i collagen and fibronectin. aberrant activation of the wnt pathway has been implicated in pathological processes such as fibrosis and cancer.  in cardiac muscle development, beta-catenin performs a biphasic role. initially, the activation of wnt/beta-catenin is essential for committing mesenchymal cells to a cardiac lineage; however, in later stages of development, the downregulation of beta-catenin is required.


=== involvement in cardiac physiology ===
in cardiac muscle, beta-catenin forms a complex with n-cadherin at adherens junctions within intercalated disc structures, which are responsible for electrical and mechanical coupling of adjacent cardiac cells. studies in a model of adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes have shown that the appearance and distribution of beta-catenin is spatio-temporally regulated during the redifferentiation of these cells in culture. specifically, beta-catenin is part of a distinct complex with n-cadherin and alpha-catenin, which is abundant at adherens junctions in early stages following cardiomyocyte isolation for the reformation of cell–cell contacts. it has been shown that beta-catenin forms a complex with emerin in cardiomyocytes at adherens junctions within intercalated discs; and this interaction is dependent on the presence of gsk 3-beta phosphorylation sites on beta-catenin. knocking out emerin significantly altered beta-catenin localization and the overall intercalated disc architecture, which resembled a dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype.in animal models of cardiac disease, functions of beta-catenin have been unveiled. in a guinea pig model of aortic stenosis and left ventricular hypertrophy, beta-catenin was shown to change subcellular localization from intercalated discs to the cytosol, despite no change in the overall cellular abundance of beta-catenin. vinculin showed a similar profile of change. n-cadherin showed no change, and there was no compensatory upregulation of plakoglobin at intercalated discs in the absence of beta-catenin. in a hamster model of cardiomyopathy and heart failure, cell–cell adhesions were irregular and disorganized, and expression levels of adherens junction/intercalated disc and nuclear pools of beta-catenin were decreased. these data suggest that a loss of beta-catenin may play a role in the diseased intercalated discs that have been associated with cardiac muscle hypertrophy and heart failure. in a rat model of myocardial infarction, adenoviral gene transfer of nonphosphorylatable, constitutively-active beta-catenin decreased mi size, activated the cell cycle, and reduced the amount of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes and cardiac myofibroblasts. this finding was coordinate with enhanced expression of pro-survival proteins, survivin and bcl-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor while promoting the differentiation of cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. these findings suggest that beta-catenin can promote the regeneration and healing process following myocardial infarction. in a spontaneously-hypertensive heart failure rat model, investigators detected a shuttling of beta-catenin from the intercalated disc/sarcolemma to the nucleus, evidenced by a reduction of beta-catenin expression in the membrane protein fraction and an increase in the nuclear fraction. additionally, they found a weakening in the association between glycogen synthase kinase-3β and beta-catenin, which may indicate altered protein stability. overall, results suggest that an enhanced nuclear localization of beta-catenin may be important in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy.regarding the mechanistic role of beta-catenin in cardiac hypertrophy, transgenic mouse studies have shown somewhat conflicting results regarding whether upregulation of beta-catenin is beneficial or detrimental. a recent study using a conditional knockout mouse that either lacked beta-catenin altogether or expressed a non-degradable form of beta-catenin in cardiomyocytes reconciled a potential reason for these discrepancies. there appears to be strict control over the subcellular localization of beta-catenin in cardiac muscle. mice lacking beta-catenin had no overt phenotype in the left ventricular myocardium; however, mice harboring a stabilized form of beta-catenin developed dilated cardiomyopathy, suggesting that the temporal regulation of beta-catenin by protein degradation mechanisms is critical for normal functioning of beta-catenin in cardiac cells. in a mouse model harboring knockout of a desmosomal protein, plakoglobin, implicated in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, the stabilization of beta-catenin was also enhanced, presumably to compensate for the loss of its plakogloblin homolog. these changes were coordinate with akt activation and glycogen synthase kinase 3β inhibition, suggesting once again that the abnormal stabilization of beta-catenin may be involved in the development of cardiomyopathy.  further studies employing a double knockout of plakoglobin and beta-catenin showed that the double knockout developed cardiomyopathy, fibrosis and arrhythmias resulting in sudden cardiac death. intercalated disc architecture was severely impaired and connexin 43-resident gap junctions were markedly reduced. electrocardiogram measurements captured spontaneous lethal ventricular arrhythmias in the double transgenic animals, suggesting that the two catenins—beta-catenin and plakoglobin are critical and idispensible for mechanoelectrical coupling in cardiomyocytes.


== clinical significance ==


=== role in depression ===
whether or not a given individual's brain can deal effectively with stress, and thus their susceptibility to depression, depends on the beta-catenin in each person's brain, according to a study conducted at the icahn school of medicine at mount sinai and published november 12, 2014 in the journal nature.  higher beta-catenin signaling increases behavioral flexibility, whereas defective beta-catenin signaling leads to depression and reduced stress management.


=== role in cardiac disease ===
altered expression profiles in beta-catenin have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy in humans. beta-catenin upregulation of expression has generally been observed in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. in a particular study, patients with end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy showed almost doubled estrogen receptor alpha (er-alpha) mrna and protein levels, and the er-alpha/beta-catenin interaction, present at intercalated discs of control, non-diseased human hearts was lost, suggesting that the loss of this interaction at the intercalated disc may play a role in the progression of heart failure. together with bcl9 and pygo proteins, beta-catenin coordinates different aspects of heard development, and mutations in bcl9 or pygo in model organisms - such as the mouse and zebrafish - cause phenotypes that are very similar to human congenital heart disorders.


=== involvement in cancer ===

beta-catenin is a proto-oncogene. mutations of this gene are commonly found in a variety of cancers: in primary hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, ovarian carcinoma, breast cancer, lung cancer and glioblastoma. it has been estimated that approximately 10% of all tissue samples sequenced from all cancers display mutations in the ctnnb1 gene. most of these mutations cluster on a tiny area of the n-terminal segment of β-catenin: the β-trcp binding motif. loss-of-function mutations of this motif essentially make ubiquitinylation and degradation of β-catenin impossible. it will cause β-catenin to translocate to the nucleus without any external stimulus and continuously drive transcription of its target genes. increased nuclear β-catenin levels have also been noted in basal cell carcinoma (bcc), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc), prostate cancer (cap), pilomatrixoma (ptr) and medulloblastoma (mdb) these observations may or may not implicate a mutation in the β-catenin gene: other wnt pathway components can also be faulty.
similar mutations are also frequently seen in the β-catenin recruiting motifs of apc. hereditary loss-of-function mutations of apc cause a condition known as familial adenomatous polyposis. affected individuals develop hundreds of polyps in their large intestine. most of these polyps are benign in nature, but they have the potential to transform into deadly cancer as time progresses. somatic mutations of apc in colorectal cancer are also not uncommon.  beta-catenin and apc are among the key genes (together with others, like k-ras and smad4) involved in colorectal cancer development. the potential of β-catenin to change the previously epithelial phenotype of affected cells into an invasive, mesenchyme-like type contributes greatly to metastasis formation.


=== as a therapeutic target ===
due to its involvement in cancer development, inhibition of beta-catenin continues to receive significant attention. but the targeting of the binding site on its armadillo domain is not the simplest task, due to its extensive and relatively flat surface. however, for an efficient inhibition, binding to smaller ""hotspots"" of this surface is sufficient. this way, a ""stapled"" helical peptide derived from the natural β-catenin binding motif found in lef1 was sufficient for the complete inhibition of β-catenin dependent transcription. recently, several small-molecule compounds have also been developed to target the same, highly positively charged area of the arm domain (cgp049090, pkf118-310, pkf115-584 and ztm000990). in addition, β-catenin levels can also be influenced by targeting upstream components of the wnt pathway as well as the β-catenin destruction complex. the additional n-terminal binding pocket is also important for wnt target gene activation (required for bcl9 recruitment). this site of the arm domain can be pharmacologically targeted by carnosic acid, for example. that ""auxiliary"" site is another attractive target for drug development. despite intensive preclinical research, no β-catenin inhibitors are available as therapeutic agents yet. however, its function can be further examined by sirna knockdown based on an independent validation. another therapeutic approach for reducing β-catenin nuclear accumulation is via the inhibition of galectin-3. the galectin-3 inhibitor gr-md-02 is currently undergoing clinical trials in combination with the fda-approved dose of ipilimumab in patients who have advanced melanoma. the proteins bcl9 and bcl9l have been proposed as therapeutic targets for colorectal cancers which present hyper-activated wnt signaling, because their deletion does not perturb normal homeostasis but strongly affects metastases behaviour.


=== role in fetal alcohol syndrome ===
β-catenin destabilization by ethanol is one of two known pathways whereby alcohol exposure induces fetal alcohol syndrome (the other is ethanol-induced folate deficiency). ethanol leads to β-catenin destabilization via a g-protein-dependent pathway, wherein activated phospholipase cβ hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate to diacylglycerol and inositol-(1,4,5)-trisphosphate. soluble inositol-(1,4,5)-trisphosphate triggers calcium to be released from the endoplasmic reticulum. this sudden increase in cytoplasmic calcium activates ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (camkii). activated camkii destabilizes β-catenin via a poorly characterized mechanism, but which likely involves β-catenin phosphorylation by camkii. the β-catenin transcriptional program (which is required for normal neural crest cell development) is thereby suppressed, resulting in premature neural crest cell apoptosis (cell death).

== history ==
as great britain wound down her colonial control in east africa, the royal east african navy (rean) was established in 1953, covering kenya colony, tanganyika and zanzibar. following the disbanding of the rean in 1962, the east african railways and harbours corporation assumed control of naval operations in the former colonies until the independent states were ready to establish their own navies. the kenyan navy was established on 12 december 1964, exactly one year after kenya gained independence. 
in 1976, the second squadron, made up of the missile boats kns madaraka, kns jamhuri and kns harambee left portsmouth to sail to kenya, arriving later that year. in late august 1976, during the delivery voyage, the u.s. embassy in nairobi was approached to request assistance for two of the patrol boats, off the somali coast and not having ""enough fuel to reach mombasa.""in 1972, major jcj kimaro was promoted to lieutenant colonel by president jomo kenyatta and appointed as the first commander of the kenyan navy. he died in a road accident in 1978 and major general eliud mbilu took over command until his retirement in 1988 when brigadier jre kibwana was promoted to major general.
in 2010 it was reported that the united states navy naval special warfare group 4 was assisting the creation of a new kenyan special boat unit within the kenya navy.on 4 september 2012 the kenyan navy shelled the somali city of kismayo. this was part of an african union offensive to capture the city from al-shabab fighters during the war in somalia. the harbour was shelled twice and the airport three times. according to a un report the export of charcoal through kismayo is a major source of income for al-shabab.

povidone-iodine medicated liquid soap,drug,"hand washing (or handwashing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning one's hands with soap and water to remove viruses/bacteria/microorganisms, dirt, grease, or other harmful and unwanted substances stuck to the hands. drying of the washed hands is part of the process as wet and moist hands are more easily recontaminated.if soap and water are unavailable, hand sanitizer that is at least 60% (v/v) alcohol in water (specifically, ethanol or isopropyl alcohol/isopropanol (rubbing alcohol)) can be used instead, unless hands are visibly excessively dirty or greasy.the world health organization (who) recommends washing hands for at least 20 seconds before/after the following:
before and after caring for any sick person
before, during, and after preparing food
before eating
after using the toilet (for urination, defecation, menstrual hygiene),
after helping someone who just used the toilet
after blowing one's nose, or coughing or sneezing
after touching an animal, animal feed or animal waste
after touching garbage
after coming from the hospital
after work
after any travelthe united states centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) recommends the following steps when washing one's hands for the prevention of transmission of disease:
wet hands with warm or cold running water. running water is recommended because standing basins may be contaminated, while the temperature of the water does not seem to make a difference.
lather hands by rubbing them with a generous amount of soap, including the backs of hands, between fingers, and under nails. soap lifts germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when soap is used rather than water alone.
scrub for at least 20 seconds. scrubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from skin, and scrubbing for longer periods removes more germs.
rinse well under running water. rinsing in a basin can recontaminate hands.
dry with a clean towel or allow to air dry. wet and moist hands are more easily recontaminated.the most commonly missed areas are the thumb, the wrist, the areas between the fingers, and under fingernails. artificial nails and chipped nail polish may harbor microorganisms. moisturizing lotion is often recommended to keep the hands from drying out; dry skin can lead to skin damage which can increase the risk for the transmission of infection.when both hand washing and using hand sanitizer are not available, hands can be cleaned with uncontaminated ash and  clean water, although the benefits and harms are uncertain for reducing the spread of viral or bacterial infections. however, frequent hand washing can lead to skin damage due to drying of the skin.
symbolic hand washing, using water but no soap to wash hands, is a part of ritual hand washing featured in many religions, including the baháʼí faith, hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in judaism, cantharus and lavabo in christianity, and wudhu in islam. religions also prescribe hygienic hand washing, especially after certain actions. hinduism, judaism, christianity, and islam mandate washing of hands after using the toilet. and, hinduism, buddhism, sikhism, judaism, certain denominations of christianity, and islam mandate washing of hands before and after every meal.

=== health benefits ===
hand washing has many significant health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; decreasing respiratory infections;
and reducing infant mortality rate at home birth deliveries. a 2013 study showed that improved hand washing practices may lead to small improvements in the length growth in children under five years of age. in developing countries, childhood mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap. this simple action can reduce the rate of mortality from these diseases by almost 50%. interventions that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhoea episodes by about a third, and this is comparable to providing clean water in low income areas. 48% of reductions in diarrhoea episodes can be associated with hand washing with soap.handwashing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ari), as automatic behavior performed in homes, schools, and communities worldwide. pneumonia, a major ari, is the number one cause of mortality among children under five years old, taking the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children per year. diarrhea and pneumonia together account for almost 3.5 million child deaths annually. according to unicef, turning handwashing with soap before eating and after using the toilet into an ingrained habit can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, cutting deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by one-quarter. hand washing is usually integrated with other sanitation interventions as part of water, sanitation, and hygiene (wash) programmes. hand washing also protects against impetigo which is transmitted through direct physical contact.


=== adverse effects ===
a small detrimental effect of handwashing is that frequent hand washing can lead to skin damage due to the drying of the skin. a 2012 danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to an itchy, flaky skin condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among health-care workers. too frequent hand washing is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd).


=== when it is recommended ===

there are five critical times during the day where washing hands with soap is important to reduce fecal-oral transmission of disease: after using the toilet (for urination, defecation, menstrual hygiene), after cleaning a child's bottom (changing nappies), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry. other occasions when correct handwashing technique should be practiced in order to prevent the transmission of disease include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing your nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.


=== behavior change ===
in many countries, there is a low rate of hand washing with soap. a study of hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average, 38.7% of households practiced hand washing with soap.a 2014 study showed that saudi arabia had the highest rate of 97 percent; the united states near the middle with 77 percent; and china with the lowest rate of 23 percent.several behavior change methodologies now exist to increase uptake of the behavior of hand washing with soap at the critical times.group hand washing for school children at set times of the day is one option in developing countries to engrain hand washing in children's behaviors. the ""essential health care program"" implemented by the department of education in the philippines is an example of at scale action to promote children's health and education. deworming twice a year, supplemented with washing hands daily with soap, brushing teeth daily with fluoride, is at the core of this national program. it has also been successfully implemented in indonesia.


== substances used ==


=== soap and detergents ===
removal of microorganisms from skin is enhanced by the addition of soaps or detergents to water. soap and detergents are surfactants that kill microorganisms by disorganizing their membrane lipid bilayer and denaturing their proteins. it also emulsifies oils, enabling them to be carried away by running water.


==== solid soap ====
solid soap, because of its reusable nature, may hold bacteria acquired from previous uses. a small number of studies which have looked at the bacterial transfer from contaminated solid soap have concluded transfer is unlikely as the bacteria are rinsed off with the foam. the cdc still states ""liquid soap with hands-free controls for dispensing is preferable"".


==== antibacterial soap ====
antibacterial soaps have been heavily promoted to a health-conscious public. to date, there is no evidence that using recommended antiseptics or disinfectants selects for antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature. however, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms. so, even if antibiotic resistant strains aren't selected for by antibacterial soaps, they might not be as effective as they are marketed to be. besides the surfactant and skin-protecting agent, the sophisticated formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as ph regulator, antimicrobially active benzoic acid and further skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).a 2007 meta-analysis from the university of oregon school of public health indicated that plain soaps are as effective as consumer-grade anti-bacterial soaps containing triclosan in preventing illness and removing bacteria from the hands. dissenting, a 2011 meta-analysis in the journal of food protection argued that when properly formulated, triclosan can grant a small but detectable improvement, as can chlorhexidine gluconate, iodophor, or povidone.


=== warm water ===
hot water that is still comfortable for washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria. bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °c). who considers warm soapy water to be more effective than cold, soapy water at removing natural oils which hold soils and bacteria. but cdc mentions that warm water causes skin irritations more often and its ecological footprint is more significant. water temperatures from 4 to 40 °c do not differ significantly regarding removal of microbes. the most important factor is proper scrubbing.contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on hands.


=== antiseptics ===

a hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand hygiene agent. in the late 1990s and early part of the 21st century, alcohol rub non-water-based hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity. most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated together with a thickening agent such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) into a gel, or a humectant such as glycerin into a liquid, or foam for ease of use and to decrease the drying effect of the alcohol. adding diluted hydrogen-peroxide increases further the antimicrobial activity.hand sanitizers containing a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol are efficient germ killers. alcohol rub sanitizers kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (mrsa and vre), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including hiv, herpes, rsv, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi. alcohol rub sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (3.5 log reduction, similar to 35 decibel reduction) of the bacteria on hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction) of the bacteria on hands 1 minute after application.hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses. alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or norwalk) type viruses, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis.in a 2020 cochrane review comparing rinse-free hand washing to conventional soap and water techniques and the subsequent impact on school absenteeism found a small but beneficial effect on rinse-free hand washing on illness related absenteeism.enough hand antiseptic or alcohol rub must be used to thoroughly wet or cover both hands. the front and back of both hands and between and the ends of all fingers must be rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry. finger tips must be washed well too, rubbing them in both palms.us centers for disease control and prevention recommend hand washing over hand sanitizer rubs, particularly when hands are visibly dirty. the increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid killing activity against micro-organisms; however, they should not serve as a replacement for proper hand washing unless soap and water are unavailable.
frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula. the drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula. in clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused substantially less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial detergents. allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in alcohol hand rubs rarely occur. the lower tendency to induce irritant contact dermatitis became an attraction as compared to soap and water hand washing.
despite their effectiveness, non-water agents do not cleanse the hands of organic material, but simply disinfect them. it is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water at preventing the spread of many pathogens, since the pathogens remain on the hands.
alcohol-free hand sanitizer efficacy is heavily dependent on the ingredients and formulation, and historically has significantly under-performed alcohol and alcohol rubs. more recently, formulations that use benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to decrease in efficacy after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions.


=== wipes ===
hand washing using hand sanitizing wipes is an alternative during traveling in the absence of soap and water. alcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.


=== ash or mud ===
many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and use ash or soil instead. the world health organization recommended ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available. evidence quality to support the use of ash to wash hands is poor and it is not clear if washing hands with ash is effective at reducing viral or bacterial spreading compared to washing with mud, not washing, or with washing with water alone. one concern is that if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms it may increase the spread of disease rather than decrease it, however, there is also no clear evidence to determine the level of risk. like soap, ash is also a disinfecting agent because in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.


== technologies and design aspects ==


=== low-cost options when water is scarce ===

various low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing where tap-water and/or soap is not available e.g. pouring water from a hanging jerrycan or gourd with suitable holes and/or using ash if needed in developing countries.in situations with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-conserving solutions, such as ""tippy-taps"" and other low-cost options. a tippy-tap is a simple technology using a jug suspended by a rope, and a foot-operated lever to pour a small amount of water over the hands and a bar of soap.low-cost hand washing technologies for households may differ from facilities for multiple users. for households, options include tippy taps, bucket/container with tap, conventional tap with/without basin, valve/tap fitted to bottles, bucket and cup, camp sink. options for multiple users include: adapting household technologies for multiple users, water container fitted to a pipe with multiple taps, water container fitted to a pipe with holes.

		
		
		


=== advance technologies ===
several companies around the globe have developed technologies that aim to improve the hand
washing process. among the different inventions, there are eco-friendly devices that use 90% less
water and 60% less soap compared to hand washing under a faucet. another device uses
light-based rays to detect contaminants on the hands after they have been washed.certain environments are especially sensitive to the transmission of pathogenic microorganisms, like health care and food production. organizations attempting to prevent infection transmission in these environments have started using programmed washing cycles that provide sufficient time for scrubbing the hands with soap and rinsing them with water. combined with ai-powered software, these technological advancements turn the hand-washing process into digital data, allowing individuals to receive insights and improve their hand hygiene practices.


=== drying with towels or hand driers ===

effective drying of the hands is an essential part of the hand hygiene process. therefore, the proper drying of hands after washing should be an integral part of the hand hygiene process in health care.the world health organization (who) and the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) are clear and straightforward concerning hand hygiene, and recommend paper towels and hand dryers equally. both have stressed the importance of frequent and thorough hand washing followed by their complete drying as a means to stop the spread of germs, like coronavirus. specifically, the world health organization recommends that everyone “frequently clean [their] hands…” and “dry [them] thoroughly by using paper towels or a warm air dryer.” the centers for disease control and prevention report that, “both [clean towels or air hand dryers] are effective ways to dry hands.” 
a study in 2020 found that hand dryers and paper towels were both found to be equally hygienic hand-drying solutions.however, there is some debate over the most effective form of drying in public toilets. a growing volume of research suggests paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many public toilets. a review in 2012 concluded that ""from a hygiene standpoint, paper towels are superior to air dryers; therefore, paper towels should be recommended for use in locations in which hygiene is paramount, such as hospitals and clinics.""jet-air dryers were found to be capable of blowing micro-organisms from the hands and the unit and potentially contaminating other users and the environment up to 2 metres away. in the same study in 2008 (sponsored by the paper-towel industry the european tissue symposium), use of a warm-air hand dryer spread micro-organisms only up to 0.25 metres from the dryer, and paper towels showed no significant spread of micro-organisms. no studies have found a correlation to hand dryers and human health, however, making these findings inconsequential. 


=== accessibility ===
making hand washing facilities accessible (inclusive) to everyone is crucial to maintain hand washing behavior. considerations for accessibility include age, disability, seasonality (with rains and muddiness), location and more. important aspects for good accessibility include: placement of the technology, paths, ramps, steps, type of tap, soap placement.


== medical use ==

medical hand-washing became mandatory long after hungarian physician ignaz semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in a hospital environment. there are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget. one study has found decreased infection rates with their use.


=== method ===

medical hand-washing is for a minimum of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to lather and rub each part of the hands. hands should be rubbed together with digits interlocking. if there is debris under fingernails, a bristle brush may be used to remove it. since germs may remain in the water on the hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe dry with a clean towel. after drying, the paper towel should be used to turn off the water (and open any exit door if necessary). this avoids re-contaminating the hands from those surfaces.
the purpose of hand-washing in the health-care setting is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (""germs"") and avoid transmitting them. the new england journal of medicine reports that a lack of hand-washing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, with large numbers of doctors and nurses routinely forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms. one study showed that proper hand-washing and other simple procedures can decrease the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent.the world health organization has published a sheet demonstrating standard hand-washing and hand-rubbing in health-care sectors. the draft guidance of hand hygiene by the organization can also be found at its website for public comment. a relevant review was conducted by whitby et al. commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene, if demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
the world health organization has ""five moments"" for washing hands:

before patient care
after environmental contact
after exposure to blood/body fluids
before an aseptic task, and
after patient care.the addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (""medicated"" or ""antimicrobial"" soaps) confers killing action to a hand-washing agent. such killing action may be desired before performing surgery or in settings in which antibiotic-resistant organisms are highly prevalent.to 'scrub' one's hands for a surgical operation, it is necessary to have a tap that can be turned on and off without touching it with the hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine wash, sterile towels for drying the hands after washing, and a sterile brush for scrubbing and another sterile instrument for cleaning under the fingernails. all jewelry should be removed. this procedure requires washing the hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually 2–6 minutes. long scrub-times (10 minutes) are not necessary. when rinsing, water on the forearms must be prevented from running back to the hands. after hand-washing is completed, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical gown is donned.


=== effectiveness in healthcare settings ===
to reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash the hands or use a hand antiseptic before and after tending to a sick person.
for control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit from hand-cleansing came from the first 20% of washing, and that very little additional benefit was gained when hand cleansing frequency was increased beyond 35%. washing with plain soap results in more than triple the rate of bacterial infectious disease transmitted to food as compared to washing with antibacterial soap.comparing hand-rubbing with alcohol-based solution with hand washing with antibacterial soap for a median time of 30 seconds each showed that the alcohol hand-rubbing reduced bacterial contamination 26% more than the antibacterial soap. but soap and water is more effective than alcohol-based hand rubs for reducing h1n1 influenza a virus and clostridium difficile spores from hands.interventions to improve hand hygiene in healthcare settings can involve education for staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand rub, and written and verbal reminders to staff. there is a need for more research into which of these interventions are most effective in different healthcare settings.


== developing countries ==

in developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective, essential tool for achieving good health, and even good nutrition. however, a lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, at schools and the workplace make it a challenge to achieve universal hand washing behaviors. for example, in most of rural africa hand washing taps close to every private or public toilet are scarce, even though cheap options exist to build hand washing stations. however, low hand washing rates can also be the result of engrained habits rather than due to a lack of soap or water.hand washing at a global level has its own indicator within sustainable development goal 6, target 6.2 which states ""by 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations. the corresponding indicator 6.2.1 is formulated as follows: ""proportion of population using (a) safely managed sanitation services and (b) a hand-washing facility with soap and water"" (see map to the right with data worldwide from 2017).""


=== promotion campaigns ===

the promotion and advocacy of hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term behavior change of the population. for this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary. a systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective at increasing hand washing in lmics, while social marketing campaigns are less effective.one example for hand washing promotion in schools is the ""three star approach"" by unicef that encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygienic requirements. when minimum standards are achieved, schools can move from one to ultimately three stars. building hand washing stations can be a part of hand washing promotion campaigns that are carried out to reduce diseases and child mortality.
global hand washing day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that is trying to achieve behavior change.as a result of the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, unicef promoted the adoption of a hand washing emoji.designing hand washing facilities that encourage use can use the following aspects:
nudges, cues and reminders
hand washing facilities should be placed at convenient locations to encourage people to use them regularly and at the right times; they should be attractive and well maintained.


=== cost effectiveness ===
few studies have considered the overall cost effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relationship to dalys averted. however, one review suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.


== history ==

the importance of hand washing for human health – particularly for people in vulnerable circumstances like mothers who had just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals – was first recognized in the mid 19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the hungarian physician ignaz semmelweis who worked in vienna, austria and florence nightingale, the english ""founder of modern nursing"". at that time most people still believed that infections were caused by foul odors called miasmas.
in the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and healthcare-associated infections led the united states centers for disease control and prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection. the outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the covid-19 pandemic in 2020 led to increased awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect oneself from such infectious diseases. for example, posters with ""correct hand washing techniques"" were hung up next to hand washing sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports in germany.


== society and culture ==


=== moral aspects ===
the phrase ""washing one's hands of"" something, means declaring one's unwillingness to take responsibility for the thing or share complicity in it. it originates from the bible passage in matthew where pontius pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify jesus christ, but has become a phrase with a much wider usage in some english communities.
in shakespeare's macbeth, lady macbeth begins to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to cleanse an imagined stain, representing her guilty conscience regarding crimes she had committed and induced her husband to commit.
it has also been found that people, after having recalled or contemplated unethical acts, tend to wash hands more often than others, and tend to value hand washing equipment more. furthermore, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such a contemplation are less likely to engage in other ""cleansing"" compensatory actions, such as volunteering.


=== religion ===

religions prescribe hand washing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes.symbolic hand washing, using water but no soap to wash hands, is a part of ritual hand washing featured in many religions, including the baháʼí faith, hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in judaism, cantharus and lavabo in christianity, and wudhu in islam.religions also prescribe hygienic hand washing, especially after certain actions. hinduism, judaism, christianity, and islam mandate washing of hands after using the toilet. in hinduism, buddhism, sikhism, judaism, certain denominations of christianity, and islam mandate washing of hands before and after every meal.

acriflavine,antibiotic,"acriflavine (inn: acriflavinium chloride) is a topical antiseptic. it has the form of an orange or brown powder. it may be harmful in the eyes or if inhaled. it is a dye and it stains the skin and may irritate. the hydrochloride form is more irritating than the neutral form.
it is derived from acridine.  commercial preparations are often mixtures with proflavine. it is known by a variety of commercial names.


== uses ==


=== medical use ===
acriflavine was developed in 1912 by paul ehrlich, a german medical researcher, and was used during the first world war against sleeping sickness and as a topical antiseptic.


=== other uses ===
acriflavine is used in biochemistry for fluorescently labeling high molecular weight rna.it is used as treatment for external fungal infections of aquarium fish.


== research ==
in an animal model, acriflavine has been shown to inhibit hif-1, which prevents blood vessels growing to supply tumors with blood and interferes with glucose uptake and use.acriflavine might be effective in fighting common cold virus, and also aid the fight against increasingly antibiotic resistant bacteria  because it can cure (remove) plasmids containing antimicrobial resistance genes from gram positive bacteria.since 2014, acriflavine has been undergoing testing as an antimalarial drug to treat parasites with resistance to quinine and modern anti-parasitic medicines.

ioannis grivas,non_science,"ioannis grivas (greek: ιωάννης γρίβας; 23 february 1923 – 27 november 2016) was a greek judge, who served as president of the court of cassation and served as the prime minister of greece at the head of a non-party caretaker government in 1989.


== life ==
grivas was born in kato tithorea, phthiotis. he studied law at the university of athens and in 1954 he became a judge. he took part as a judge in the greek junta trials in 1975, and in 1979, he was appointed to the supreme court of greece for civil and criminal cases. he became vice-president of the court in 1986 and president in 1989–90.in 1989, when the greek parliament was deadlocked between the pasok and new democracy parties following the 18 june 1989 elections, the constitution requiring that the president of one of greece's supreme courts be appointed interim prime minister, grivas agreed to head a caretaker government to preside over fresh elections.
he took office on 12 october 1989 to lead the country to new elections, held on 5 november. after the elections produced another deadlocked parliament, he resigned on 23 november 1989 in favour of xenophon zolotas, who formed a coalition government in which all three parliamentary parties participated. grivas retired in 1990. he died on 27 november 2016, aged 93.

anagrelide,drug,"anagrelide (agrylin/xagrid, shire and thromboreductin, aop orphan pharmaceuticals ag) is a drug used for the treatment of essential thrombocytosis (also known as essential thrombocythemia), or overproduction of blood platelets. it also has been used in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia.anagrelide controlled release (gale-401) is in phase iii clinical trials by galena biopharma for the treatment of essential thrombocytosis.


== medical uses ==
anagrelide is used to treat essential thrombocytosis, especially when the current treatment of the patient is insufficient. essential thrombocytosis patients who are suitable for anagrelide often meet one or more of the following factors:
age over 60 years
platelet count over 1000×109/l
a history of thrombosisaccording to a 2005 medical research council randomized trial, the combination of hydroxyurea with aspirin is superior to the combination of anagrelide and aspirin for the initial management of essential thrombocytosis.  the hydroxyurea arm had a lower likelihood of myelofibrosis, arterial thrombosis, and bleeding, but it had a slightly higher rate of venous thrombosis.  anagrelide can be useful in times when hydroxyurea proves ineffective.


== side-effects ==
common side effects are headache, diarrhea, unusual weakness/fatigue, hair loss, nausea.
the same mrc trial mentioned above also analyzed the effects of anagrelide on bone marrow fibrosis, a common feature in patients with myelofibrosis. the use of anagrelide was associated with a rapid increase in the degree of reticulin deposition (the mechanism by which fibrosis occurs), when compared to those in whom hydroxyurea was used. patients with myeloproliferative conditions are known to have a very slow and somewhat variable course of marrow fibrosis increase. this trend may be accelerated by anagrelide. this increase in fibrosis appeared to be linked to a drop in hemoglobin as it progressed. stopping anagrelide (and switching patients to hydroxyurea) appeared to reverse the degree of marrow fibrosis. thus, patients on anagrelide may need to be monitored on a periodic basis for marrow reticulin scores, especially if anemia develops, or becomes more pronounced if present initially.less common side effects include: congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, cardiomegaly, complete heart block, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, pericarditis, pulmonary infiltrates, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, pancreatitis, gastric/duodenal ulceration, renal impairment/failure and seizure.
due to these issues, anagrelide should not generally be considered for first line therapy for essential thrombocytosis.


== mechanism of action ==
anagrelide works by inhibiting the maturation of platelets from megakaryocytes. the exact mechanism of action is unclear, although it is known to be a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. it is a potent (ic50 = 36nm) inhibitor of phosphodiesterase-ii. it inhibits pde-3 and phospholipase a2.


== synthesis ==
phosphodiesterase inhibitor with antiplatelet activity.

condensation of benzyl chloride 1 with ethyl ester of glycine gives alkylated product 2. reduction of the nitro group leads to the aniline and reaction of this with cyanogen bromide possibly gives cyanamide 3 as the initial intermediate. addition of the aliphatic would then lead to formation of the quinazoline ring (4). amide formation between the newly formed imide and the ester would then serve to form the imidazolone ring, whatever the details of the sequence, there is obtained anagrelide (5).

tin dioxide,reagent,"tin(iv) oxide, also known as stannic oxide, is the inorganic compound with the formula sno2. the mineral form of sno2 is called cassiterite, and this is the main ore of tin. with many other names, this oxide of tin is an important material in tin chemistry. it is a colourless, diamagnetic, amphoteric solid.


== structure ==

tin(iv) oxide crystallises with the rutile structure.  as such the tin atoms are six coordinate and the oxygen atoms three coordinate. sno2 is usually regarded as an oxygen-deficient n-type semiconductor.hydrous forms of sno2 have been described as stannic acid. such materials appear to be hydrated particles of sno2 where the composition reflects the particle size.


== preparation ==
tin(iv) oxide occurs naturally. synthetic tin(iv) oxide is produced by burning tin metal in air. annual production is in the range of 10 kilotons. sno2 is reduced industrially to the metal with carbon in a reverberatory furnace at 1200–1300 °c.


== amphoterism ==
although sno2 is insoluble in water, it is amphoteric, dissolving in base and acid. ""stannic acid"" refers to hydrated tin (iv) oxide, sno2, which is also called ""stannic hydroxide.""
tin oxides dissolve in acids. halogen acids attack sno2 to give hexahalostannates, such as [sni6]2−. one report describes reacting a sample in refluxing hi for many hours.
sno2 + 6 hi → h2sni6 + 2 h2osimilarly, sno2 dissolves in sulfuric acid to give the sulfate:
sno2 + 2 h2so4 → sn(so4)2 + 2 h2osno2 dissolves in strong bases to give ""stannates,"" with the nominal formula na2sno3. dissolving the solidified sno2/naoh melt in water gives na2[sn(oh)6]2, ""preparing salt,"" which is used in the dye industry.


== uses ==
in conjunction with vanadium oxide, it is used as a catalyst for the oxidation of aromatic compounds in the synthesis of carboxylic acids and acid anhydrides.


=== ceramic glazes ===
tin(iv) oxide has long been used as an opacifier and as a white colorant in ceramic glazes. this has probably led to the discovery of the pigment lead-tin-yellow, which was produced using tin(iv) oxide as a compound. the use of tin(iv) oxide has been particularly common in glazes for earthenware, sanitaryware and wall tiles; see the articles tin-glazing and tin-glazed pottery. tin oxide remains in suspension in vitreous matrix of the fired glazes, and, with its high refractive index being sufficiently different from the matrix, light is scattered, and hence increases the opacity of the glaze. the degree of dissolution increases with the firing temperature, and hence the extent of opacity diminishes. although dependent on the other constituents the solubility of tin oxide in glaze melts is generally low. its solubility is increased by na2o, k2o and b2o3, and reduced by cao, bao, zno, al2o3, and to a limited extent pbo.sno2 has been used as pigment in the manufacture of glasses, enamels and ceramic glazes. pure sno2 gives a milky white colour; other colours are achieved when mixed with other metallic oxides e.g. v2o5 yellow; cr2o3 pink; and sb2o5 grey blue.


=== dyes ===
this oxide of tin has been utilized as a mordant in the dyeing process since ancient egypt. a german by the name of kuster first introduced its use to london in 1533 and by means of it alone, the color scarlet was produced there.


=== polishing ===
tin(iv) oxide can be used as a polishing powder, sometimes in mixtures also with lead oxide, for polishing glass, jewelry, marble and silver. tin(iv) oxide for this use is sometimes called as ""putty powder"" or ""jeweler's putty"".


=== glass coatings ===
sno2 coatings can be applied using chemical vapor deposition, vapour deposition techniques that employ sncl4 or organotin trihalides e.g. butyltin trichloride as the volatile agent. this technique is used to coat glass bottles with a thin (<0.1 μm) layer of sno2, which helps to adhere a subsequent, protective polymer coating such as polyethylene to the glass.thicker layers doped with sb or f ions are electrically conducting and used in electroluminescent devices and photovoltaics.


=== gas sensing ===
sno2 is used in sensors of combustible gases including carbon monoxide detectors. in these the sensor area is heated to a constant temperature (few hundred °c) and in the presence of a combustible gas the electrical resistivity drops.
room temperature gas sensors are also being developed using reduced graphene oxide-sno2 composites(e.g. for ethanol detection).doping with various compounds has been investigated (e.g. with cuo). doping with cobalt and manganese, gives a material that can be used in e.g. high voltage varistors. tin(iv) oxide can be doped with the oxides of iron or manganese.

nutritionally-regulated adipose and cardiac-enriched protein (mouse),protein,"angiopoietin-like 3, also known as angptl3, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the angptl3 gene.


== function ==
the protein encoded by this gene is a member of the angiopoietin-like family of secreted factors. it is expressed predominantly in the liver, and has the characteristic structure of angiopoietins, consisting of a signal peptide, n-terminal coiled-coil domain, and the c-terminal fibrinogen (fbn)-like domain. the fbn-like domain in angiopoietin-like 3 protein was shown to bind alpha-5/beta-3 integrins, and this binding induced endothelial cell adhesion and migration. this protein may also play a role in the regulation of angiogenesis.angptl3 also acts as dual inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase (lpl) and endothelial lipase (el), thereby increasing plasma triglyceride, ldl cholesterol and hdl cholesterol in mice and humans.angptl3 inhibits endothelial lipase hydrolysis of hdl-phospholipid (pl), thereby increasing hdl-pl levels. circulating pl-rich hdl particles have high cholesterol efflux abilities.angptl3 plays a major role in promoting uptake of circulating triglycerides into white adipose tissue in the fed state, likely through activation by angptl8, a feeding-induced hepatokine, to inhibit postprandial lpl activity in cardiac and skeletal muscles, as suggested by the angptl3-4-8 model.


== clinical significance ==
in human, angptl3 is a determinant factor of hdl level and positively correlates with plasma hdl cholesterol.
in humans with genetic loss-of-function variants in one copy of angptl3, the serum ldl-c levels are reduced. in those with loss-of-function variants in both copies of angptl3, low ldl-c, low hdl-c, and low triglycerides are seen (""familial combined hypolipidemia"").

ketorolac injection,drug,"ketorolac, sold under the brand name toradol  among others, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) used to treat pain. specifically it is recommended for moderate to severe pain. recommended duration of treatment is less than six days. it is used by mouth, by nose, by injection into a vein or muscle, and as eye drops. effects begin within an hour and last for up to eight hours.common side effects include sleepiness, dizziness, abdominal pain, swelling, and nausea. serious side effects may include stomach bleeding, kidney failure, heart attacks, bronchospasm, heart failure, and anaphylaxis. use is not recommended during the last part of pregnancy or during breastfeeding. ketorolac works by blocking cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 (cox1 and cox2), thereby decreasing production of prostaglandins.ketorolac was patented in 1976 and approved for medical use in 1989. it is available as a generic medication. in 2017, it was the 271st most commonly prescribed medication in the united states, with more than one million prescriptions.


== medical uses ==

ketorolac is used for short-term management of moderate to severe pain. it is usually not prescribed for longer than five days, due to its potential to cause kidney damage.ketorolac is effective when administered with paracetamol to control pain in newborns because it does not depress respiration as do opioids. ketorolac is also an adjuvant to opioid medications and improves pain relief. it is also used to treat dysmenorrhea. ketorolac is used to treat idiopathic pericarditis, where it reduces inflammation.for systemic use, ketorolac can be administered orally, under the tongue, by intramuscular injection, intravenously, and by nasal spray. usually, it is initially administered by intramuscular injection or intravenously, with oral therapy used as a continuation after the initial im or iv dose.ketorolac is also used as an eye drop. it can be given during eye surgery to help with pain, and is effective in treating ocular itching. the eye drops are associated with decreased development of macular edema after cataract surgery, and is more effective alone than as an opioid/ketorolac combination treatment. ketorolac eye drops have also been used to manage pain from corneal abrasions.during treatment with ketorolac, clinicians monitor for the manifestation of adverse effects. lab tests, such as liver function tests, bleeding time, bun, serum creatinine and electrolyte levels are often used and help to identify potential complications.


== contraindications ==
ketorolac is contraindicated in those with hypersensitivity, allergies to the medication, cross-sensitivity to other nsaids, prior to surgery, history of peptic ulcer disease, gastrointestinal bleeding, alcohol intolerance, renal impairment, cerebrovascular bleeding, nasal polyps, angioedema, and asthma. recommendations exist for cautious use of ketorolac in those who have experienced cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, coagulation disorders, renal impairment, and hepatic impairment.


== adverse effects ==
a common (>10%) side effect is drowsiness. infrequent (<1%) side effects include paresthesia, prolonged bleeding time, injection site pain, purpura, sweating, abnormal thinking, increased production of tears, edema, pallor, dry mouth, abnormal taste, urinary frequency, increased liver enzymes, itching and others. platelet function can be decreased by use of ketorolac.though uncommon, potentially fatal adverse effects include stroke, myocardial infarction, gi bleeding, stevens–johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and anaphylaxis. in terms of safety, ketorolac has been assessed to be a relatively higher-risk nsaid when compared to aceclofenac, celecoxib, and ibuprofen.like all nsaids, ketorolac can cause premature constriction of the ductus arteriosus in the infant if taken by the mother during the third trimester of pregnancy.in october 2020, the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. they recommend avoiding nsaids in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy.


== interactions ==
ketorolac can interact with other medications. probenecid can increase the probability of having an adverse reaction when taken with ketorolac. pentoxifylline can increase the risk of bleeding. when aspirin is taken at the same time as ketorolac, the effectiveness is decreased. problematic gi effects are additive and become more likely if potassium supplements, aspirin, other nsaids, corticosteroids, or alcohol is taken at the same time. the effectiveness of antihypertensives and diuretics can be lowered. the use of ketorolac can increase serum lithium levels to the point of toxicity. toxicity to methotrexate is more likely if ketorolac is taken at the same time. the risk of bleeding increases with the concurrent medications clopidogrel, cefoperazone, valproic acid, cefotetan, eptifibatide, tirofiban, and ticlopidine. anticoagulants and thrombolytic medications also increase the likelihood of bleeding. medications used to treat cancer can interact with ketorolac along with radiation therapy. the risk of toxicity to the kidneys increases when ketorolac is taken with cyclosporine.interactions with ketorolac also exist with some herbal supplements. the use of panax ginseng, clove, ginger, arnica, feverfew, dong quai, chamomile, and ginkgo biloba increases the risk of bleeding.


== mechanism of action ==
chemically ketorolac functions as a carboxylic acid derivative serving non-selectively to block the prostaglandin synthesis by inhibition of prostaglandin g/h synthesis one and two. prostaglandin functions in the body as a messenger for contraction/relaxation of smooth muscle and modulation of inflammation. resultant, inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis prevents inflammation. the primary mechanism of action responsible for ketorolac's anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic effects is the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by competitive blocking of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (cox). ketorolac is a non-selective cox inhibitor. it is considered a first-generation nsaid.


== history ==
in the us, ketorolac is the only widely available intravenous nsaid. an iv form of paracetamol, which is not an nsaid, became available in europe in 2009 and then in the us.the syntex company, of palo alto, california developed the ophthalmic solution acular around 2006.in 2007, there were concerns about the high incidence of reported side effects. this led to restriction in its dosage and maximum duration of use. in the uk, treatment was initiated only in a hospital, although this was not designed to exclude its use in prehospital care and mountain rescue settings. dosing guidelines were published at that time.concerns over the high incidence of reported side effects with ketorolac trometamol led to its withdrawal (apart from the ophthalmic formulation) in several countries, while in others its permitted dosage and maximum duration of treatment have been reduced. from 1990 to 1993, 97 reactions with a fatal outcome were reported worldwide.the eye-drop formulation was approved by the fda in 1992.an intranasal formulation (sprix) was approved by the fda in 2010 for short-term management of moderate to moderately severe pain requiring analgesia at the opioid level.
ketorolac has also been used in collegiate and professional sports, and is reported to be routinely used in the national football league and national hockey league. competitive sports athletes, particularly in contact sports, are often required to play through injuries. in the late 1990s opioids and their associated pharmaceutical companies came under fire. then sporting leagues began to push back against team physicians giving them to players attempting to play through injuries as it was clear that numbing the pain during practice/competition only furthered injuries. resultantly teams moved to using ketorolac as the drug is certainly powerful enough to numb players pain, but ketorolac is not a commonly abused drug with a bad reputation. furthermore, ketorolac is a nsaid which are generally considered safe by those without a background in pharmacology as they are associated with more mild drugs such as aspirin/ibuprofen. only recently has this issue been addressed, with researchers speaking out and making recommendations and a lawsuit against the national football league in 2017.

dental pulp cell,cell,"the pulp is the part in the center of a tooth made up of living connective tissue and cells called odontoblasts. the pulp is a part of the dentin–pulp complex (endodontium). the vitality of the dentin-pulp complex, both during health and after injury, depends on pulp cell activity and the signaling processes that regulate the cell's behavior.


== anatomy ==
the pulp is the neurovascular bundle central to each tooth, permanent or primary. it comprises a central pulp chamber, pulp horns, and radicular canals. the large mass of pulp is contained within the pulp chamber, which is contained in and mimics the overall shape of the crown of the tooth. because of the continuous deposition of dentine, the pulp chamber becomes smaller with age. this is not uniform throughout the coronal pulp but progresses faster on the floor than on the roof or side walls.
radicular pulp canals extend down from the cervical region of the crown to the root apex. they are not always straight but vary in shape, size, and number. they are continuous with the periapical tissues through the apical foramen or foramina.
the total volumes of all the permanent teeth organs is 0.38cc and the mean volume of a single adult human pulp is 0.02cc.
accessory canals are pathways from the radicular pulp, extending laterally through the dentin to the periodontal tissue seen especially in the apical third of the root. accessory canals are also called lateral canals because they are usually located on the lateral surface of the roots of the teeth.


== development ==
the pulp has a background similar to that of dentin, because both are derived from the dental papilla of the tooth germ. during odontogenesis, when the dentin forms around the dental papilla, the innermost tissue is considered pulp.

there are 4 main stages of tooth development:
1.bud stage
2.cap stage
3.bell stage
4.crown stage
the first signs of tooth development are known to be as early as 6th week of intrauterine life. the oral epithelium begins to multiply and invaginates into ectomesenchyme cells which gives rise to dental lamina. the dental lamina is the origin of tooth bud. the bud stage progresses onto cap stage when the epithelium forms the enamel organ.  the ectomesenchyme cells condenses further and becomes dental papilla. together, the epithelial enamel organ and ectomesenchymal dental papilla and follicle form the tooth germ. the dental papilla is the origin of dental pulp. cells at the periphery of the dental papilla undergo cell division and differentiation to becomes odontoblasts. pulpoblasts forms in the middle of the pulp. this completes the formation of the pulp. the dental pulp is essentially a mature dental papilla.the development of dental pulp can also be split into two stages:
the coronal pulp development (near the crown of tooth) and root pulp development (apex of tooth).
the pulp develops 4 regions from the periphery to the central pulp:

 odontoblast layer
cell free  zone – likely to be an artefact
cell rich zone
pulp core 


== internal structure ==

the central region of the coronal and radicular pulp contains large nerve trunks and blood vessels.
this area is lined peripherally by a specialized odontogenic area which has four layers (from innermost to outermost):

pulpal core, which is in the center of the pulp chamber with many cells and an extensive vascular supply; except for its location, it is very similar to the cell-rich zone.
cell rich zone; which contains fibroblasts and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells.
cell free zone (zone of weil) which is rich in both capillaries and nerve networks.
odontoblastic layer; outermost layer which contains odontoblasts and lies next to the predentin and mature dentin.cells found in the dental pulp include fibroblasts (the principal cell), odontoblasts, defence cells like histiocytes, macrophage, granulocytes, mast cells and plasma cells.the nerve plexus of raschkow is located central to the cell-rich zone.


=== the plexus of raschkow ===
the plexus of raschkow monitors painful sensations. by virtue of their peptide content they also play important functions in inflammatory events and subsequent tissue repair. there are two types of nerve fiber that mediate the sensation of pain: a-fibers conduct rapid and sharp pain sensations and belong to the myelinated group, whereas c-fibers are involved in dull aching pain and are thinner and unmyelinated. the a-fibers, mainly of the a-delta type, are preferentially located in the periphery of the pulp, where they are in close association with the odontoblasts and extend fibers to many but not all dentinal tubules. the c-fibers typically terminate in the pulp tissue proper, either as free nerve endings or as branches around blood vessels. sensory nerve fibers that originate from inferior and superior alveolar nerves innervate the odontoblastic layer of the pulp cavity. these nerves enter the tooth through the apical foramen as myelinated nerve bundles. they branch to form the subodontoblastic nerve plexus of raschkow which is separated from the odontoblasts by a cell-free zone of weil, therefore this plexus lies between the cell free and cell rich zones of the pulp.


=== pulp innervation ===
as the dental pulp is a highly vascularised and innervated region of the tooth, it is the site of origin for most pain-related sensations. the dental pulp nerve is innervated by one of the trigeminal nerves, otherwise known as the fifth cranial nerve. the neurons enter the pulp cavity through the apical foramen, and branch off to form the nerve plexus of raschkow (as mentioned earlier). nerves from the plexus of rasckow give branches to form a marginal plexus around the odontoblasts, with some nerves penetrating the dentinal tubules.
the dental pulp is also innervated by the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system. these sympathetic axons projects into the radicular pulp, where they form a plexus along the blood vessels. their function is mainly related to the blood vessel constriction within the dental pulp. hence, a sharp fall in pulpal blood flow maybe very possibly be caused by a stimulation of these nerves.there is no evidence for a parasympathetic pulpal innervation.
there are 2 main types of sensory nerve fibres in the pulp, each densely located at different locations. moreover, the differing structural features of the 2 sensory nerve fibres also results in the different types of sensory stimulation.

myelinated a-fibres:
the a-fibres present in the pulp can be further classified into 2 different types, the a-delta fibres which makes up 90% of the a-fibres, while the rest are a-beta fibres.
a relatively low-threshold sensory apparatus.
mainly located at pulp-dentine border at the top of the pulp, and more specifically concentrated in the pulp horn.
it has a relatively small diameter, hence has a relatively slow conduction velocity. however, it is still faster than c-fibres.
a-fibres transmit signals to the brainstem are then to the contralateral thalamus.
able to respond to stimuli through a shell of calcified tissue due to the stimulus-induced fluid flow in dentinal tubules. this is known as the hydrodynamic theory. stimuli that displaces the fluid within the dentinal tubules will trigger the intradental myelinated a-fibres, leading to a sharp pain sensation, commonly associated with dentine hypersensitivity
unmyelinated c-fibres:
they are mainly located at the core of the pulp, and extends into underneath the odontoblastic layer.
on the contrary, c-fibres have higher thresholds, responsible for detecting inflammatory threats.
since it is heavily influenced by modulating interneurons before it reaches the thalamus, hence c-fibre stimulation often results in a “slow pain”, often characterised as a dull and aching pain.


== functions ==
the primary function of the dental pulp is to form dentin (by the odontoblasts).
other functions include:

nutritive: the pulp keeps the organic components of the surrounding mineralized tissue supplied with moisture and nutrients;
protective/sensory: extremes in temperature, pressure, or trauma to the dentin or pulp are perceived as pain;
defensive/reparative : the formation of reparative or tertiary dentin (by the odontoblasts);
formative: cells of the pulp produce dentin which surrounds and protects the pulpal tissue.


== pulp testing ==
see dental pulp test
the health of the dental pulp can be established by a variety of diagnostic aids which test either the blood supply to a tooth (vitality test) or the sensory response of the nerves within the root canal to specific stimuli (sensitivity test). although less accurate, sensitivity tests, such as electric pulp tests or thermal tests, are more routinely used in clinical practice than vitality testing which require specialised equipment.
a healthy tooth is expected to respond to sensitivity testing with a short, sharp burst of pain which subsides when the stimulus is removed. an exaggerated or prolonged response to sensitivity testing indicates that the tooth has some degree of symptomatic pulpitis. a tooth which does not respond at all to sensitivity testing may have become necrotic.


== pulpal diagnoses ==


=== normal pulp ===
in a healthy tooth pulp, the pulp is well-protected from infection by the enamel and dentin layers.
a healthy normal pulp:
-is vital and normally responsive to pulp testing
-is symptoms and inflammation free
-has a mild or transient response clinically to thermal and cold testing which should last no more than 1–2 seconds after stimulus is removed


=== reversible pulpitis ===
a mild to moderate inflammation of dental pulp caused by any momentary irritation or stimulant whereby no pain is felt upon removal of stimulants. the pulp swells when the protective layers of enamel and dentine are compromised. unlike irreversible pulpitis, the pulp still gives a regular response to sensibility tests and inflammation resolves with management of the cause. there is no significant radiographic changes in the periapical region hence further examination is mandatory to ensure that the dental pulp has returned to its normal healthy state.


==== common causes ====
-      bacterial infection from caries
-      thermal shock
-      trauma
-      excessive dehydration of a cavity during restoration
-      irritation of exposed dentine
-      repetitive trauma caused by bruxism (tooth grinding) or jaw misalignment
-      fractured tooth exposing pulp


==== symptoms ====
-      temporary post-restoration sensitivity
-      pain is non- spontaneous and is milder compared to irreversible pulpitis
-      short sharp pain due to a stimulant


==== how it is diagnosed ====
-      x-rays to determine extent of tooth decay and inflammation
-      sensitivity tests to see if pain or discomfort is experienced when tooth is in contact with hot, cold or sweet stimuli
-      tooth tap test (lightweight, blunt instrument gently tapped onto affected tooth to determine extent of inflammation)
-      electric pulp test


==== treatment ====
-      treatment aetiology should resolve reversible pulpitis; treating it early may help prevent irreversible pulpitis
-      follow-up after treatment required to determine whether the reversible pulpitis has returned to a normal status


==== prevention ====
-      regular check-ups for carcinogenic or non-carcinogenic caries

=== irreversible pulpitis ===
pulpitis is established when the pulp chamber is compromised by bacterial infection. irreversible pulpitis is diagnosed when the pulp of the tooth is inflamed and infected beyond the point of no return, healing of the pulp is not possible. removal of the aetiological agent will not permit healing and often root canal treatment is indicated. irreversible pulpitis is commonly a sequel to reversible pulpitis when early intervention is not taken. it is key to note that in this stage of the disease progression, the pulp is still vital and vascularised; it is not classified as ‘dead pulp’ until necrosis occurs.irreversible and reversible pulpitis are differentiated from each other based on the various pain responses that they have to thermal stimulation. if the condition is reversible then the pulp's pain response will last momentarily upon exposure to cold or hot substances; a few seconds. however, if the pain lingers from minutes to hours, then the condition is irreversible. this is a common presenting complaint that facilitates diagnoses before further investigations e.g. sensibility tests and peri-apical radiographs are proceeded.diagnosis of irreversible pulpitis is branched into two sub-divisions: symptomatic and asymptomatic. asymptomatic irreversible pulpitis is a transition of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis into an inactive and quiescent state. this is due to the nature of its causation; the inflammatory exudate can be quickly removed e.g. through a large carious cavity or previous trauma that caused painless exposure of pulp. it is the build-up of pressure in a confined pulp space that stimulates nerve fibres and initiates pain reflexes. when this pressure is relieved, pain is not experienced.as the names imply, these diseases are largely characterised by the symptoms they present, duration and location of pain, causing and relieving factors. a clinician's role is to gather all this information systematically. this will be a compilation of clinical tests (cold ethyl chloride, ept, hot gutta percha, palpation), radiographic analysis (peri-apical and/or cone beam computed tomography) and any further tests deemed necessary. thermal tests are subjective by nature, so performed on not only the compromised tooth, but the adjacent and contra-lateral teeth as well, allowing the patient to compare information and give the clinician more accurate responses. normal healthy teeth are used as a baseline for diagnoses.the following are key characteristics of each pathology:
symptomatic irreversible pulpitis:
-      very spontaneous and unpredictable pain. can occur at any time of day and specific causing factors cannot be labelled.
-      patient may complain of sharp lingering pains, that last longer than 30 seconds even after removal of stimulus.
-      there may be referred pain
-      pain may be more pronounced after changes of posture e.g. from lying down to standing up
-      analgesics tend to be ineffective
-      as the bacteria have not yet progressed to the peri-apical region, there is no pain on percussion.
asymptomatic irreversible pulpitis
-      there are no clinical symptoms
-      pulp will respond to sensibility tests as a healthy pulp would   treatments: require endodontic (root canal) treatment or tooth extraction. in endodontic therapy, removal of the inflamed pulp relieves the pain. the empty root canal system is then obturated with gutta-percha which is a rubber material that acts as a pressure and pain reliever.


==== complications ====
pulp acts as a security and alarm system for a tooth. slight decay in tooth structure not extending to the dentin may not alarm the pulp but as the dentin gets exposed, either due to dental caries or trauma, sensitivity starts. the dentinal tubules pass the stimulus to odontoblastic layer of the pulp which in turns triggers the response. this mainly responds to cold. at this stage simple restorations can be performed for treatment. as the decay progresses near the pulp the response also magnifies and sensation to a hot diet as well as cold gets louder. at this stage indirect pulp capping might work for treatment but at times it is impossible to clinically diagnose the extent of decay, pulpitis may elicit at this stage. carious dentin by dental decay progressing to pulp may get fractured during mastication (chewing food) causing direct trauma to the pulp hence eliciting pulpitis.
the inflammation of the pulp is known as pulpitis. pulpitis can be extremely painful and in serious cases calls for root canal therapy or endodontic therapy. traumatized pulp starts an inflammatory response but due to the hard and closed surroundings of the pulp pressure builds inside the pulp chamber compressing the nerve fibres and eliciting extreme pain (acute pulpitis). at this stage the death of the pulp starts which eventually progresses to periapical abscess formation (chronic pulpitis).
the pulp horns recede with age. also with increased age, the pulp undergoes a decrease in intercellular substance, water, and cells as it fills with an increased amount of collagen fibers. this decrease in cells is especially evident in the reduced number of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells. thus, the pulp becomes more fibrotic with increased age, leading to a reduction in the regenerative capacity of the pulp due its loss of these cells. also, the overall pulp cavity may be smaller by the addition of secondary or tertiary dentin, thus causing pulp recession. the lack of sensitivity associated with older teeth is due to receded pulp horns, pulp fibrosis, addition of dentin, or possibly all these age-related changes; many times restorative treatment can be performed without local anesthesia on older dentitions.


=== pulp necrosis ===
pulp necrosis describes when the pulp of a tooth has become necrotic. the pulp tissue is either dead or dying, this may be for a number of reasons including: untreated caries, trauma or bacterial infection. it is often subsequent to chronic pulpitis. teeth with pulp necrosis will need to undergo root canal treatment or extraction to prevent further spread of infection which may lead to an abscess.


==== symptoms ====
pulp necrosis may be symptomatic or asymptomatic for the patient. if the necrosis is symptomatic it could result in lingering pain to hot and cold stimuli, spontaneous pain that may cause a patient to wake up during sleep, difficulty with eating and being tender to percussion. if the necrosis is asymptomatic it will be non-responsive to thermal stimuli or electric pulp tests, the patient may even be unaware of the pathology.


==== diagnosis ====
if the pulpal necrosis is asymptomatic it may go unnoticed by the patient and so a diagnosis may be missed without the use of special tests. to determine if pulp necrosis is present a dentist may take radiographic images (x-rays) and sensitivity testing e.g. hot or cold stimuli (using warm gutta percha or ethyl chloride); or they may use an electric pulp tester. vitality of a tooth, which refers to blood supply to a tooth, may be assessed using doppler flowmetry. sequelae of a necrotic pulp include acute apical periodontitis, dental abscess, or radicular cyst and discolouration of the tooth.


==== prognosis & treatment ====
if a necrotic pulp is left untreated it may result in further complications such as infection, fever, swelling, abscesses and bone loss. currently there are only two treatment options for teeth which have undergone pulpal necrosis. future treatments aim to assess revascularisation of pulp tissue using techniques such as cell homing.


== pulp response to caries ==
pulpal response to caries can be divided into two stages – non-infected pulp and infected pulp. in caries-affected human teeth, there are odontoblast-like cell at the dentine-pulp interface and specialized pulp immune cells to combat caries. once they identify specific bacterial components, these cells activate innate and adaptive aspects of dental pulp immunity.
in a non-infected pulp, leukocytes are present to sample biologically and respond to the surrounding environment, including macrophages, dendritic cells (dcs), t cells and b cells. this sampling process is part of the normal protective immune response as it triggers leukocytes from the circulatory system to adhere to endothelial cells lining blood vessels and then migrate to the site of infection for defense potential. macrophages can phagocytose bacteria and activate t cells triggering an adaptive immune response which occurs in association with dcs. in the pulp, dcs secrete a range of cytokines that influence both innate and adaptive immune responses, and they are considered key regulators of the tissue’s defense against infection. there is also a comparatively small number of b cells present in the healthy pulp tissue, and as there is pulpitis and caries progression, their numbers also increase.when bacteria get closer to the pulp but are still confined to primary or secondary dentine, acid demineralization of dentine will occur, leading to the production of tertiary dentine to help protect the pulp from further insult.
after a pulp exposure, pulp cells are recruited, then differentiate into odontoblast-like cells, and contribute to the formation of a dentine bridge and thus increasing the residual dentin thickness. odontoblast-like cell is a mineralized structure formed by a new population of pulp-derived which can be expressed as toll-like receptors. they are responsible for the upregulation of innate immunity effectors, including antimicrobial agents and chemokines. one important antimicrobial agent produced by odontoblast is beta-defensins (bds). bds kill microorganisms by forming micropores that destroy membrane integrity and cause leakage of the cell content. another one is nitric oxide (no), a highly diffusible free radical, which stimulates the production of chemokine to attract immune cells into the affected areas and neutralize bacterial by-product in human pulp cells in vitro.


== pulp stones ==
pulp stones are calcified masses that occur in the pulp, either in the apical or coronal portions.  they are classified according to their structure or location. according to their location, pulp stones can either be classed as free (completely surrounded by soft pulp tissue), embedded (surrounded by dentine tissue) or adherent (attached to pulp wall and are continuous with dentine but not fully enclosed). depending on the structure of the pulp stones they are either true (dentine lined by odontoblasts), false (formed from degenerating cells that mineralise) or diffuse (more irregular in shape to false stones). the cause of pulp stones is little understood however it has been recorded that pulpal calcifications can occur due to:

pulp degeneration
increasing age (especially in the 4th advancing decade)
orthodontic treatment
trauma - traumatic occlusion
dental caries histologically, pulp stones usually consist of circular layers of mineralised tissues. these layers are made up of blood clots, dead cells and collagen fibres. occasionally, pulp stones can be seen to be surrounded by odontoblast like cells that contain tubules. however, this type of  pulp stone are rarely seen.the prevalence of pulp stones can reach as high as 50% in surveyed samples however pulp stones are estimated to range from 8-9%. pulpal calcifications are more commonly found in females and more frequently found in maxillary teeth compared to mandibular teeth although the reason is unknown. they are also more common in molar teeth especially first molars compared to second molars and premolars. a systematic review suggested that the reason for this was because the first molars are the first teeth to be located in the mandible (lower jaw) and therefore longer exposure to degenerative changes. it also has larger blood supply.in general, pulp stones do not require any treatment, however, depending on the size and location of the stones they may interfere with endodontic treatment and therefore be removed.

cementocyte,cell,"a cementoblast is a biological cell that forms from the follicular cells around the root of a tooth, and whose biological function is cementogenesis, which is the formation of cementum (hard tissue that covers the tooth root). the mechanism of differentiation of the cementoblasts is controversial but circumstantial evidence suggests that an epithelium or epithelial component may cause dental sac cells to differentiate into cementoblasts, characterised by an increase in length. other theories involve hertwig epithelial root sheath (hers) being involved.


== structure ==
thus cementoblasts resemble bone-forming osteoblasts but differ functionally and histologically. the cells of cementum are the entrapped cementoblasts, the cementocytes. each cementocyte lies in its lacuna (plural, lacunae), similar to the pattern noted in bone. these lacunae also have canaliculi or canals. unlike those in bone, however, these canals in cementum do not contain nerves, nor do they radiate outward. instead, the canals are oriented toward the periodontal ligament (pdl) and contain cementocytic processes that exist to diffuse nutrients from the ligament because it is vascularized. the progenitor cells also found in the pdl region contribute to the mineralization of the tissue.once in this situation, the cementoblasts lose their secretory activity and become cementocytes. however, a layer of cementoblasts is always present along the outer covering of the pdl; these cells can then produce cementum if the tooth is injured (see hypercementosis).

perivascular macrophage,cell,"a perivascular space, also known as a virchow–robin space, is a fluid-filled space surrounding certain blood vessels in several organs, including the brain, potentially having an immunological function, but more broadly a dispersive role for neural and blood-derived messengers. the brain pia mater is reflected from the surface of the brain onto the surface of blood vessels in the subarachnoid space. in the brain, perivascular cuffs are regions of leukocyte aggregation in the perivascular spaces, usually found in patients with viral encephalitis.
perivascular spaces vary in dimension according to the type of blood vessel. in the brain where most capillaries have an imperceptible perivascular space, select structures of the brain, such as the circumventricular organs, are notable for having large perivascular spaces surrounding highly permeable capillaries, as observed by microscopy. the median eminence, a brain structure at the base of the hypothalamus, contains capillaries with wide perivascular spaces.in humans, perivascular spaces surround arteries and veins can usually be seen as areas of dilatation on mri images.  while many normal brains will show a few dilated spaces, an increase in these spaces may correlate with the incidence of several neurodegenerative diseases, making the spaces a topic of research.


== structure ==
perivascular spaces are gaps containing interstitial fluid that span between blood vessels and their host organ, such as the brain, which they penetrate and serve as extravascular channels through which solutes can pass. like the blood vessels around which they form, perivascular spaces are found in both the brain subarachnoid space and the subpial space.perivascular spaces surrounding arteries in the cerebral cortex and the basal ganglia are separated from the subpial space by one or two layers of leptomeninges, respectively, as well as the pia mater. by virtue of the leptomeningeal cell layer, the perivascular spaces belonging to the subarachnoid space are continuous with those of the subpial space. the direct communication between the perivascular spaces of the subarachnoid space and the subpial space is unique to the brain’s arteries, as no leptomeningeal layers surround the brain’s veins. use of the scanning electron microscope has determined that the spaces surrounding blood vessels in the subarachnoid space are not continuous with the subarachnoid space because of the presence of pia mater cells joined by desmosomes.perivascular spaces, especially around fenestrated capillaries, are found in many organs, such as the thymus, liver, kidneys, spleen, bones, and pineal gland. particularly within the brain circumventricular organs – subfornical organ, area postrema, and median eminence – large perivascular spaces are present around fenestrated capillaries, indicating that the spaces serve a dispersive role for brain- or bloodborne messengers.perivascular  spaces may be enlarged to a diameter of five millimeters in healthy humans and do not imply disease. when enlarged, they can disrupt the function of the brain regions into which they project. dilation can occur on one or both sides of the brain.dilated perivascular spaces are categorized into three types:
type 1  are located on the lenticulostriate arteries projecting into the basal ganglia
type 2  are located in the cortex following the path of the medullary arteries
type 3  are located in the midbrainperivascular spaces are most commonly located in the basal ganglia and white matter of the cerebrum, and along the optic tract.
the ideal method used to visualize perivascular spaces is t2-weighted mri. the mr images of other neurological disorders can be similar to those of the dilated spaces. these disorders are:
cystic neoplasms
lacunar infarctions
cystic periventricular leukomalacia
cryptococcosis
multiple sclerosis
mucopolysaccharidoses
neurocysticercosis
arachnoid cysts
neuroepithelial cystsperivascular spaces are distinguished on an mri by several key features. the spaces appear as distinct round or oval entities with a signal intensity visually equivalent to that of cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space. in addition, a perivascular space has no mass effect and is located along the blood vessel around which it forms.


== function ==
one of the most basic roles of the perivascular space is the regulation of fluid movement in the central nervous system and its drainage.  the spaces ultimately drain fluid from neuronal cell bodies to the cervical lymph nodes. in particular, the “tide hypothesis” suggests that the cardiac contraction creates and maintains pressure waves to modulate the flow to and from the subarachnoid space and the perivascular space.  by acting as a sort of sponge, they are essential for signal transmission and the maintenance of extracellular fluid.another function is as an integral part of the blood–brain barrier (bbb).  while the bbb is often described as the tight junctions between the endothelial cells, this is an oversimplification that neglects the intricate role that perivascular spaces take in separating the venous blood from the parenchyma of the brain.  often, cell debris and foreign particles, which are impermeable to the bbb will get through the endothelial cells, only to be phagocytosed in the perivascular spaces. this holds true for many t and b cells, as well as monocytes, giving this small fluid filled space an important immunological role.perivascular spaces also play an important role in immunoregulation; they not only contain interstitial and cerebrospinal fluid, but they also have a constant flux of macrophages, which is regulated by blood-borne mononuclear cells, but do not pass the basement membrane of the glia limitans.  similarly, as part of its role in signal transmission, perivascular spaces contain vasoactive neuropeptides (vns), which, aside from regulating blood pressure and heart rate, have an integral role in controlling microglia.  vns serve to prevent inflammation by activating the enzyme adenylate cyclase which then produces camp.  the production of camp aids in the modulation of auto-reactive t cells by regulatory t cells. . the perivascular space is susceptible space for vn compromise and when their function is reduced in the space, immune response is adversely affected and the potential for degradation increases. when inflammation by t cells begins, astrocytes begin to undergo apoptosis, due to their cd95 receptor, to open up the glia limitans and let t cells into the parenchyma of the brain.  because this process is aided by the perivascular macrophages, these tend to accumulate during neuroinflammation and cause dilation of the spaces.


== clinical significance ==
the clinical significance of perivascular spaces comes primarily from their tendency to dilate. the importance of dilation is hypothesized to be based on changes in shape rather than size. enlarged spaces have been observed most commonly in the basal ganglia, specifically on the lenticulostriate arteries. they have also been observed along the paramedial mesencephalothalamic artery and the substantia nigra in the mesencephalon, the brain region below the insula, the dentate nucleus in the cerebellum, and the corpus callosum, as well as the brain region directly above it, the cingulate gyrus. upon the clinical application of mri, it was shown in several studies that perivascular space dilation and lacunar strokes are the most commonly observed histological correlates of signaling abnormalities.


=== senescence ===
dilation is most commonly and closely associated with aging. dilation of perivascular spaces has been shown to correlate best with age, even when accompanying factors including hypertension, dementia, and white matter lesions are considered. in the elderly, such dilation has been correlated with many symptoms and conditions which often affect the arterial walls, including vascular hypertension, arteriosclerosis, reduced cognitive capacity, dementia, and low post-mortem brain weight. in addition to dilation among the elderly, dilation in young, healthy individuals can also be observed. this occurrence is rare and there has been no observed association in such cases with reduced cognitive function or white matter abnormalities. when dilated vrs are observed in the corpus callosum, there is generally no neurological deficit associated. they are often observed in this region as cystic lesions with cerebrospinal-like fluid.


=== symptoms of dilation ===
extreme dilation has been associated with several specific clinical symptoms. in cases of severe dilation in only one hemisphere, symptoms reported include a non-specific fainting attack, hypertension, positional vertigo, headache, early recall disturbances, and hemifacial tics. symptoms associated with severe bilateral dilation include ear pain (which was reported to have resolved on its own), dementia, and seizures. this data was compiled from case studies of individuals with severe vrs dilation. considering the anatomical abnormality presented in such cases, these findings were considered surprising in that the symptoms were relatively mild. in most cases there is in fact no mass effect associated with some vrs dilation. an exception to the mildness of clinical symptoms associated with vrs dilation is when there is extreme dilation in the lower mesencephalon at the junction between the substantia nigra and cerebral peduncle. in such cases, mild to moderate obstructive hydrocephalus was reported in most patients. associated symptoms ranged from headaches to symptoms more severe than those just discussed in the cases of dilation in the cerebral hemispheres. other general symptoms associated with vrs dilation include headaches, dizziness, memory impairment, poor concentration, dementia, visual changes, oculomotor abnormality, tremors, seizures, limb weakness, and ataxia.


=== associated disorders ===
dilation is a typical characteristic of several diseases and disorders. these include diseases from metabolic and genetic disorders such as mannosidosis, myotonic dystrophy, lowe syndrome, and coffin–lowry syndrome. dilation is also a common characteristic of diseases or disorders of vascular pathologies, including cadasil (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy), hereditary infantile hemiparesis, retinal arteriolar tortuosity and leukoencephalopathy, migraines, and vascular dementia. a third group disorders typically associated with vrs dilation are neuroectodermal syndromes. this includes polycystic brains associated with ectodermal dysplasia, frontonasal dysplasia, and joubert syndrome. there is a fourth miscellaneous group of disorders typically associated with dilation which include autism in children, megalencephalopathy, secondary parkinson’s disease, recent-onset multiple sclerosis and chronic alcoholism. because dilation can be associated with several diseases but also observed in healthy patients, it is always important in the evaluation of vrs to study the tissue around the dilation via mri and to consider the entire clinical context.


== current research ==


=== causes of dilated vrs ===
much of the current research concerning virchow–robin spaces relates to their known tendency to dilate. research is presently being performed in order to determine the exact cause of dilation in these perivascular spaces. current theories include mechanical trauma resulting from cerebrospinal fluid pulsation, elongation of ectactic penetrating blood vessels, and abnormal vascular permeability leading to increased fluid exudation. further research has implicated shrinkage or atrophy of surrounding brain tissue, perivascular demyelination, coiling of the arteries as they age, altered permeability of the arterial wall and obstruction of lymphatic drainage pathways. in addition, insufficient fluid draining and injury to ischemic perivascular tissue resulting in an ex vacuo effect have been suggested as possible causes for dilated vrs.


=== association of dilated vrs and other diseases ===
recent and ongoing research has found associations between enlarged vrs and several disorders.


==== dementia ====
at one point in time, dilated virchow–robin spaces were so commonly noted in autopsies of persons with dementia, they were believed to cause the disease. however, additional research is currently being performed in order to confirm or refute a direct connection between dilation of vrs and dementia.analysis of vrs may distinguish dementia caused by arteriosclerotic microvascular disease from dementia caused by neurodegenerative disease. a 2005 study has evidenced that a substantial amount of vrs in the substantia innominata, lentiform nucleus, and the caudate nucleus of the basal ganglia may implicate dementia due to arteriosclerotic microvascular disease, in particular ischemic vascular dementia, as opposed dementia due to neurodegenerative disease, specifically alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal dementia. thus, perhaps vrs dilation can be used to distinguish between diagnoses of vascular dementias and degenerative dementias.


==== alzheimer's disease ====
some studies have assessed the spatial distribution and prevalence of vrs in people with alzheimer's disease versus those without the disease. researchers have found that while vrs appear to be correlated with natural aging, mr imaging reveals a greater prevalence of vrs in those with alzheimer's.cerebral amyloid angiopathy (caa), a blood vessel failure often associated with alzheimer's disease, utilizes dilated vrs to spread inflammation to the parenchyma.  because the vrs often have an extra membrane in gray matter, the ischemic caa response is often observed in white matter.it has been hypothesized that the structure of vrs in the cerebral cortex may contribute to the development of alzheimer’s disease. in contrast to vrs of the basal ganglia, vrs in the cerebral cortex are surrounded by only one layer of leptomeninges. as such, vrs in the cerebral cortex may drain β-amyloid in interstitial fluid less effectively than vrs in the basal ganglia. the less-effective drainage may lead to the development of the β-amyloid plaques that characterize alzheimer’s disease. in support of this hypothesis, studies have noted the greater frequency of β-amyloid plaques in the cerebral cortex than in the basal ganglia of alzheimer’s disease patients.


==== stroke ====
because dilated perivascular spaces are so closely correlated with cerebrovascular disease, there is much current research on their use as a diagnostic tool. in a recent study of 31 subjects, abnormal dilation, along with irregular csf pulsation, were correlated with those subjects having three or more risk factors for strokes.  therefore, perivascular spaces are a possible novel biomarker for hemorrhagic strokes.cadasil syndrome (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy syndrome) is a hereditary stroke condition due to a notch 3 gene mutation on chromosome 19. studies have noted that in comparison to family members lacking the affected haplotype that leads to the condition, an increased number of dilated spaces is observed in individuals with cadasil. these perivascular spaces are localized primarily in the putamen and temporal subcortical white matter and they appear to correlate with age of the individual with the condition rather than severity of the disease itself.there has been a high risk of stroke associated with dilated perivascular spaces in the elderly according to the framingham stroke risk score. in contrast, other studies have concluded that the dilation of these spaces is a normal phenomenon in aging with no association with arterosclerosis. this remains, therefore, an important point of research in the field.


==== multiple sclerosis ====
similar to the research concerning a potential connection between perivascular spaces and alzheimer's, mri scans of people recently diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (ms) have been studied. larger, more prevalent spaces have been observed in those with ms. additional studies with similar findings have suggested that the inflammatory cells which contribute to the demyelination that characterizes ms also attack the perivascular spaces. studies using advanced mri techniques will be necessary to determine if the perivascular spaces can be implicated as a potential marker of the disease.


==== autism ====
dilated perivascular spaces are common among the elderly and uncommon in children. studies have noted the association between both developmental delay and non-syndromic autism and enlarged or dilated perivascular spaces. non-syndromic autism categorizes autistic patients for which there is no known cause.


== history ==
the appearance of perivascular spaces was first noted in 1843 by durant-fardel. in 1851, rudolph virchow was the first to provide a detailed description of these microscopic spaces between the outer and inner/middle lamina of the brain vessels. charles-philippe robin confirmed these findings in 1859 and was the first to describe the perivascular spaces as channels that existed in normal anatomy. the spaces were called virchow-robin spaces and are still also known as such. the immunological significance was discovered by wilhelm his, sr. in 1865 based on his observations of the flow of interstitial fluid over the spaces to the lymphatic system.for many years after virchow-robin spaces were first described, it was thought that they were in free communication with the cerebrospinal fluid in the  subarachnoid space. it was later shown with the use of electron microscopy that the pia mater serves as separation between the two. upon the application of mri, measurements of the differences of signal intensity between the perivascular spaces and cerebrospinal fluid supported these findings. as research technologies continued to expand, so too did information regarding their function, anatomy and clinical significance.

rosehip neuron,cell,"rosehip neurons are inhibitory gabaergic neurons present in the first layer (the molecular layer) of the human cerebral cortex. they make up about 10-15% of all inhibitory neurons in layer 1. neurons of this type (having ""large ‘rosehip’-like axonal boutons and compact arborization"") exist in humans, but have not been reported in rodents.an international group of scientists discovered rosehip neurons and announced their discovery in august 2018. these authors contributed equally to this work: eszter boldog (university of szeged, szeged, hungary), trygve e. bakken (allen institute for brain science, seattle, wa, united states), and rebecca d. hodge (allen institute for brain science, seattle, wa, united states).rosehip neurons are named after the rose hip fruit due to the axon terminal's resemblance to the berries of rose hip.
these rosehip cells show an immunohistochemical profile (gad1+cck+, cnr1–sst–calb2–pvalb–) matching a single transcriptomically defined cell type whose specific molecular marker signature is not seen in mouse cortex. rosehip cells in layer 1 make homotypic gap junctions, predominantly target apical dendritic shafts of layer 3 pyramidal neurons, and inhibit backpropagating pyramidal action potentials in microdomains of the dendritic tuft. these cells are therefore positioned for potent local control of distal dendritic computation in cortical pyramidal neurons.

angiotensin ii receptor 1,protein,"angiotensin ii receptor blockers (arbs), formally angiotensin ii receptor type 1 (at1) antagonists, also known as angiotensin receptor blocker, angiotensin ii receptor antagonists, or at1 receptor antagonists, are a group of pharmaceuticals that bind to and inhibit the angiotensin ii receptor type 1 (at1) and thereby block the arteriolar contraction and sodium retention effects of renin–angiotensin system.their main uses are in the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure), diabetic nephropathy (kidney damage due to diabetes) and congestive heart failure. they selectively block the activation of the at1 receptor, preventing the binding of angiotensin ii compared to ace inhibitors.arbs and the similar-attributed ace inhibitors are both indicated as the first-line antihypertensives in patients developing hypertension along with left-sided heart failure. however, arbs appear to produce less adverse effects compared to ace inhibitors.


== medical uses ==
angiotensin ii receptor blockers are used primarily for the treatment of hypertension where the patient is intolerant of ace inhibitor therapy primarily because of persistent and/or dry cough.  they do not inhibit the breakdown of bradykinin or other kinins, and are thus only rarely associated with the persistent dry cough and/or angioedema that limit ace inhibitor therapy.  more recently, they have been used for the treatment of heart failure in patients intolerant of ace inhibitor therapy, in particular candesartan. irbesartan and losartan have trial data showing benefit in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, and may delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy. a 1998 double-blind study found ""that lisinopril improved insulin sensitivity whereas losartan did not affect it."" candesartan is used experimentally in preventive treatment of migraine. lisinopril has been found less often effective than candesartan at preventing migraine.the angiotensin ii receptor blockers have differing potencies in relation to blood pressure control, with statistically differing effects at the maximal doses.  when used in clinical practice, the particular agent used may vary based on the degree of response required.
some of these drugs have a uricosuric effect.in one study after 10 weeks of treatment with an arb called losartan (cozaar), 88% of hypertensive males with sexual dysfunction reported improvement in at least one area of sexuality, and overall sexual satisfaction improved from 7.3% to 58.5%. in a study comparing beta-blocker carvedilol with valsartan, the angiotensin ii receptor blocker not only had no deleterious effect on sexual function, but actually improved it. other arbs include candesartan (atacand), telmisartan (micardis), and valsartan (diovan), fimasartan (kanarb).
angiotensin ii, through at1 receptor stimulation, is a major stress hormone and, because (arbs) block these receptors, in addition to their eliciting anti-hypertensive effects, may be considered for the treatment of stress-related disorders.in 2008, they were reported to have a remarkable negative association with alzheimer's disease (ad).  a retrospective analysis of five million patient records with the us department of veterans affairs system found different types of commonly used antihypertensive medications had very different ad outcomes.  those patients taking angiotensin receptor blockers (arbs) were 35–40% less likely to develop ad than those using other antihypertensives.


== adverse effects ==
this class of drugs is usually well tolerated. common adverse drug reactions (adrs) include: dizziness, headache, and/or hyperkalemia. infrequent adrs associated with therapy include: first dose orthostatic hypotension, rash, diarrhea, dyspepsia, abnormal liver function, muscle cramp, myalgia, back pain, insomnia, decreased hemoglobin levels, renal impairment, pharyngitis, and/or nasal congestion. a 2014 cochrane systematic review based on randomized controlled trials reported that when comparing patients taking ace inhibitors to patients taking arbs, fewer arb patients withdrew from the study due to adverse events compared to ace inhibitor patients.while one of the main rationales for the use of this class is the avoidance of a persistent dry cough and/or angioedema associated with ace inhibitor therapy, rarely they may still occur. in addition, there is also a small risk of cross-reactivity in patients having experienced angioedema with ace inhibitor therapy.

the issue of whether angiotensin ii receptor antagonists slightly increase the risk of myocardial infarction (mi or heart attack) is currently being investigated. some studies suggest arbs can increase the risk of mi. however, other studies have found arbs do not increase the risk of mi. to date, with no consensus on whether arbs have a tendency to increase the risk of myocardial infarction, further investigations are underway.
indeed, as a consequence of at1 blockade, arbs increase angiotensin ii levels several-fold above baseline by uncoupling a negative-feedback loop. increased levels of circulating angiotensin ii result in unopposed stimulation of the at2 receptors, which are, in addition, upregulated. however, recent data suggest at2 receptor stimulation may be less beneficial than previously proposed, and may even be harmful under certain circumstances through mediation of growth promotion, fibrosis, and hypertrophy, as well as eliciting proatherogenic and proinflammatory effects.


=== cancer ===
a study published in 2010 determined that ""...meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials suggests that arbs are associated with a modestly increased risk of new cancer diagnosis. given the limited data, it is not possible to draw conclusions about the exact risk of cancer associated with each particular drug. these findings warrant further investigation.""   a later meta-analysis by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) of 31 randomized controlled trials comparing arbs to other treatment found no evidence of an increased risk of incident (new) cancer, cancer-related death, breast cancer, lung cancer, or prostate cancer in patients receiving arbs. in 2013, comparative effectiveness research from the united states department of veterans affairs on the experience of more than a million veterans found no increased risks for either lung cancer  (original article  in journal of hypertension) or prostate cancer. the researchers concluded: ""in this large nationwide cohort of united states veterans, we found no evidence to support any concern of increased risk of lung cancer among new users of arbs compared with nonusers. our findings were consistent with a protective effect of arbs.""in may 2013, a senior regulator at the food & drug administration, medical team leader thomas a. marciniak, revealed publicly that contrary to the fda's official conclusion that there was no increased cancer risk, after a patient-by-patient examination of the available fda data he had concluded that there was a lung-cancer risk increase of about 24% in arb patients, compared with patients taking a placebo or other drugs. one of the criticisms marciniak made was that the earlier fda meta-analysis did not count lung carcinomas as cancers. in ten of the eleven studies he examined, marciniak said that there were more lung cancer cases in the arb group than the control group. ellis unger, chief of the drug-evaluation division that includes dr. marciniak, was quoted as calling the complaints a ""diversion,"" and saying in an interview, ""we have no reason to tell the public anything new."" in an article about the dispute, the wall street journal interviewed three other doctors to get their views; one had ""no doubt"" arbs increased cancer risk, one was concerned and wanted to see more data, and the third thought there was either no relationship or a hard to detect, low-frequency relationship.a 2016 meta-analysis including 148,334 patients found no significant differences in cancer incidence associated with arb use.


=== kidney failure ===
although arbs have protective effects against developing kidney diseases for patients with diabetes and previous hypertension without administration of arbs, arbs may worsen kidney functions such as reducing glomerular filtration rate associated with a rise of serum creatinine in patients with pre-existing proteinuria, renal artery stenosis, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, heart failure, polycystic kidney disease, chronic kidney disease, interstitial fibrosis, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or any conditions such as arbs-treated but still clinically present hypertension that lead to abnormal narrowing of blood vessels to the kidney that interrupts oxygen and nutrient supply to the organ.

== structure ==
losartan, irbesartan, olmesartan, candesartan, valsartan, fimasartan and azilsartan include the tetrazole group (a ring with four nitrogen and one carbon). losartan, irbesartan, olmesartan, candesartan, and telmisartan include one or two imidazole groups.


== mechanism of action ==
these substances are at1-receptor antagonists; that is, they block the activation of angiotensin ii at1 receptors. at1 receptors are found in smooth muscle cells of vessels, cortical cells of the adrenal gland, and adrenergic nerve synapses. blockage of at1 receptors directly causes vasodilation, reduces secretion of vasopressin, and reduces production and secretion of aldosterone, among other actions. the combined effect reduces blood pressure.
the specific efficacy of each arb within this class depends upon a combination of three pharmacodynamic (pd) and pharmacokinetic (pk) parameters. efficacy requires three key pd/pk areas at an effective level; the parameters of the three characteristics will need to be compiled into a table similar to one below, eliminating duplications and arriving at consensus values; the latter are at variance now.


=== pressor inhibition ===
pressor inhibition at trough level - this relates to the degree of blockade or inhibition of the blood pressure-raising (""pressor"") effect of angiotensin ii.  however, pressor inhibition is not a measure of blood pressure-lowering (bp) efficacy per se.  the rates as listed in the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) package inserts (pis) for inhibition of this effect at the 24th hour for the arbs are as follows: (all doses listed in pi are included)

valsartan 80 mg 30%
telmisartan 80 mg 40%
losartan 100 mg 25–40%
irbesartan 150 mg 40%
irbesartan 300 mg 60%
azilsartan 32 mg 60%
olmesartan 20 mg 61%
olmesartan 40 mg 74%


=== at1 affinity vs at2 ===
the ratios of at1 to at2 in binding affinities of the specific arbs are shown as follows. whereas, at1 affinity vs at2 is not a meaningful efficacy measurement of bp response.
losartan – 1000-fold
telmisartan – 3000-fold
irbesartan – 8500-fold
candesartan – greater than 10000-fold
olmesartan – 12500-fold
valsartan – 30000-fold higher than at2 (the ratio of binding affinities of valsartan to at1 and at2 is 30000:1)
saprisartan – ???


=== binding affinities ki ===


=== component ===
nearly all arbs contain biphenyltetrazole moiety except telmisartan and eprosartan.


=== active agent ===
losartan carries a heterocycle imidazole while valsartan carries a nonplanar acylated amino acid.


=== biological half-life ===
the third area needed to complete the overall efficacy picture of an arb is its biological half-life. the half-lives from the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) package inserts (pis) are as follows:
valsartan 6 hours
losartan 6–9 hours
azilsartan 11 hours
irbesartan 11–15 hours
olmesartan 13 hours
telmisartan 24 hours
fimasartan 7–11 hours


== comparison and pharmacokinetics ==


== longevity promotion ==
knockout of the agtr1a gene that encodes at1 results in marked prolongation of the life-span of mice by 26% compared to controls.  the likely mechanism is reduction of oxidative damage (especially to mitochondria) and overexpression of renal prosurvival genes.   the arbs seem to have the same effect.


== fibrosis regression ==
losartan and other arbs regress liver, heart, lung and kidney fibrosis.


== dilated aortic root regression ==
a 2003 study using candesartan and valsartan demonstrated an ability to regress dilated aortic root size.


== impurities ==

in 2018 and in 2019, the u.s food and drug administration (fda) found traces of ndma and ndea impurities in the angiotensin ii receptor blocker (arb) drug products valsartan, losartan, and irbesartan. the fda stated ""in june 2018, fda was informed of the presence of an impurity, identified as n-nitrosodimethylamine (ndma), from one valsartan api producer. since then, fda has determined that other types of nitrosamine compounds, e.g., n-nitrosodiethylamine (ndea), are present at unacceptable levels in apis from multiple api producers of valsartan and other drugs in the arb class."" in 2018, the fda issued guidance to the industry on how to assess and control the impurities.in august 2020, the european medicines agency (ema) provided guidance to marketing authorization holders on how to avoid the presence of nitrosamine impurities in human medicines and asked them to review all chemical and biological human medicines for the possible presence of nitrosamines and to test the products at risk.in november 2020, the committee for medicinal products for human use (chmp) of the ema aligned recommendations for limiting nitrosamine impurities in sartan medicines with recommendations it issued for other classes of medicines. the main change concerns the limits for nitrosamines, which previously applied to the active ingredients but now apply instead to the finished products (e.g. tablets). these limits, based on internationally agreed standards (ich m7(r1)), should ensure that the excess risk of cancer from nitrosamines in any sartan medicines is below 1 in 100,000 for a person taking the medicine for lifelong treatment.these sartan medicines have a specific ring structure (tetrazole) whose synthesis could potentially lead to the formation of nitrosamine impurities. other sartan medicines which do not have this ring, such as azilsartan, eprosartan and telmisartan, were not included in this review but are covered by the subsequent review of other medicines.

dolores claiborne,non_science,"dolores claiborne () is a 1992 psychological thriller novel by stephen king. the novel is narrated by the title character. atypically for a king novel, it has no chapters, double-spacing between paragraphs, or other section breaks; thus, the text is a single continuous narrative, which reads like the transcription of a spoken monologue. it was the best-selling novel of 1992 in the united states. the story introduced the fictional community of little tall island, which stephen king later used as the setting for the original tv mini-series storm of the century.
the novel was highly successful in 1992 and received overall positive reviews. it led to a successful 1995 movie adaptation that time named among the top 10 greatest stephen king film adaptations in 2013. a two-act opera adaptation premiered in san francisco in 2013, followed by a new version of the same opera in 2017.


== plot summary ==
dolores claiborne, an opinionated 65-year-old widow living on the tiny maine community of little tall island, is suspected of murdering her wealthy, elderly employer, vera donovan. the novel is presented as a transcript of her statement, told to the local constable and a stenographer. dolores wants to make clear to the police that she did not kill vera, whom she has looked after for years, but does confess to orchestrating the death of her husband, joe st. george, almost 30 years before. dolores's confession develops into the story of her life, her troubled marriage, and her relationship with her employer. 
she first describes her relationship with her employer, which began when vera and her millionaire husband purchased a summer home on little tall island in 1949 and hired dolores as a maid. able to cope with vera's brutally exacting standards, dolores rises from maid to housekeeper at the donovan home. after vera's husband dies in a car crash in the late '50s, vera spends increasing time at her island house, eventually moving there permanently. vera suffers a series of strokes in the 1980s, whereupon dolores becomes the woman's live-in caretaker and reluctant companion. as the wealthy woman slips into dementia, dolores comforts her from terrifying hallucinations of a force she calls ""the dust bunnies."" when vera is lucid, dolores combats her increasing mind games and power plays. 
dolores further reveals that when she began working at the donovan house, her marriage to joe st. george was already in distress due to his alcoholism, as well as verbal and physical abuse. their children, selena, joe jr., and pete, are unaware of the abuse. the marriage problems escalate one night in 1960 when joe viciously hits dolores in the small of her back with a piece of stove wood over a perceived slight. in retaliation, dolores smashes a ceramic cream pot over his head and threatens him with a hatchet, swearing she will kill him if he ever strikes her again. this confrontation is witnessed by their teenaged daughter, selena. joe stops beating dolores, and she allows him to leave the island community in an effort to save face. selena does not realize dolores was abused and acted in self-defense, and joe uses the hatchet incident to gain sympathy from her. a rift grows between mother and daughter.
in 1962, dolores notices selena has become increasingly withdrawn, frightened, and unsociable. after speculating she has met a boy or become involved in drugs, dolores finally confronts her daughter as they return home on the island ferry. she explains the truth of the hatchet incident and, against her wishes, selena then admits her father molested her. overwhelmed, selena nearly jumps off the side of the ferry, but dolores stops her and comforts her, vowing to protect her. that night, she considers murdering joe, describing the urge to kill him as the opening of an ""inside eye."" instead, she confronts him, promising to have him arrested if he ever touches selena again. dolores then resolves to protect her children by leaving joe. when she attempts to withdraw her children's savings accounts to fund their escape, she discovers joe has stolen everything she had saved. in despair, she breaks down crying at work, confiding in vera. an unusually sympathetic vera reveals she has had some sort of experience with dolores' ""inside eye"", and casually remarks that men like joe often die in accidents, leaving their wives everything. as she departs, she implies she arranged the car crash that killed her own husband and advises dolores ""sometimes, an accident can be an unhappy woman's best friend.""
dolores begins plotting joe's death, but she does not find an opportunity to execute her plan until the summer of 1963. vera becomes obsessed with a total solar eclipse that will be visible from the island, convinced the event will convince her estranged children to visit her. she plans a massive viewing party on the island ferry. knowing the island will be mostly empty at that time, dolores ensures selena is sent to camp, and joe jr. and pete are sent on a trip to visit family. dolores marks the location of a dried-up stone well in a patch of brambles on the edge of their property. when it becomes clear her children will not be joining her during this time, vera becomes despondent and lashes out at her hired help, calming only after dolores confronts her over the unjust firing of one of the maids. 
on the day of the eclipse, dolores buys joe a bottle of scotch and makes him a sandwich, getting him drunk and comfortable, and they share a moment of physical affection for the first time in many years. as the eclipse begins, dolores has a vision of a young girl in the path of the eclipse who is being sexually abused by her father at that same moment. reminded of what she has set out to do, she deliberately enrages joe by claiming she has recovered the money he had stolen, provoking him into attacking her. she flees into the brambles, leading joe to the well and tricking him into stepping on the rotted boards that cover it. the planks break, and he falls into the well, but is not instantly killed. he calls out for help for some time before eventually losing consciousness. dolores returns to the house and falls asleep. she has a nightmare, then checks the well. she arrives to discover joe has regained consciousness and has nearly managed to climb out. he grabs at dolores and attempts to pull her in with him. she hits him in the face with a rock, and he falls back into the well, dead.
dolores reports joe missing, and his body is found after several days of searching. joe's death is ruled an accident despite the suspicions of the local coroner and rumors. dolores is free of joe, but her actions damage her relationship with selena, who also suspects her mother killed her father.
the narration finally comes to the circumstances of vera's death, an incident which has led dolores to tell her story. she confesses that vera, in one of her hallucinations, managed to exit her wheelchair and fled in terror from ""the dust bunnies"", falling down a flight of stairs. as vera falls, dolores has a terrifying vision of joe's ghost, covered in dust. somehow alive and lucid despite her injuries, vera begs dolores to help end her suffering. dolores fetches a rolling pin, but vera dies before she can use it. the incriminating scene is discovered by the local mailman, who suspects dolores of killing the old woman and forces her to call the police. that night, dolores is harassed and threatened by members of the island community who believe she has already escaped punishment for murder in the past. the next day, dolores receives a phone call from vera's lawyer, who informs a shocked dolores that she has inherited vera's entire fortune—nearly $30 million. dolores initially refuses the money in favor of vera's estranged children but then learns they were killed in a car crash in 1961, and vera had spent the last 40 years of her life only pretending they were still alive. knowing the inheritance will be seen as a motive for murder and worsen the case against her, dolores convinces herself the only way to clear her name is to confess everything. feeling at peace with herself at long last, she ends her statement. 
several newspaper articles provide an epilogue to the story, revealing dolores was cleared of any blame in vera's death and anonymously donated vera's fortune to the new england home for little wanderers. the final article implies dolores and selena have reconciled and that selena will be coming home for the first time in 20 years.


== style ==
unlike many other works by king, little focus is given to the supernatural. although several supernatural occurrences are implied, the only such events that clearly occur in the book are two telepathic visions of a nameless young girl sexually victimised by her father, which, along with the solar eclipse backdrop, form a link to king's novel gerald's game.

twentieth dynasty of egypt,non_science,"the twentieth dynasty of egypt (notated dynasty xx, alternatively 20th dynasty or dynasty 20) is the third and last dynasty of the ancient egyptian new kingdom period, lasting from 1189 bc to 1077 bc. the 19th and 20th dynasties furthermore together constitute an era known as the ramesside period.


== history ==


=== background ===
upon the death of the last pharaoh of the 19th dynasty, queen twosret, egypt descended into a period of civil war, as attested by the elephantine stela built by setnakhte. the circumstances of twosret's demise are uncertain, as she may have died peacefully during her reign or been overthrown by setnakhte, who was likely already middle aged at the time.


=== 20th dynasty ===
a consistent theme of this dynasty was the loss of pharaonic power to the high priests of amun. horemheb, a pharaoh of the 18th dynasty, had restored the traditional ancient egyptian religion and the priesthood of amun after their abandonment by akhenaten. with the high priests now acting as intermediaries between the gods and the people, rather than the pharaoh, the position of pharaoh no longer commanded the same kind of power as it had in the past.


==== setnakhte ====
setnakhte stabilized the situation in egypt, and may have driven off an attempted invasion by the sea peoples. he ruled for about 4 years before being succeeded by his son ramesses iii.


==== ramesses iii ====
in year 5 of his reign, ramesses defeated a libyan invasion of egypt by the libu, meshwesh and seped people through marmarica, who had previously unsuccessfully invaded during the reign of merneptah.ramesses iii is most famous for decisively defeating a confederacy of the sea peoples, including the denyen, tjekker, peleset, shardana and weshesh in the battle of the delta and the battle of djahy during year 8 of his reign. within the papyrus harris i, which attests these events in detail, ramesses is said to have settled the defeated sea peoples in ""strongholds"", most likely located in canaan, as his subjects.in year 11 of ramesses' reign, another coalition of libyan invaders was defeated in egypt.
between regnal year 12 and year 29, a systematic program of reorganization of the varied cults of the ancient egyptian religion was undertaken, by creating and funding new cults and restoring temples.
in year 29 of ramesses' reign, the first recorded labor strike in human history took place, after food rations for the favored and elite royal tomb builders and artisans in the village of set maat (now known as deir el-medina), could not be provisioned.the reign of ramesses iii is also known for a harem conspiracy in which queen tiye, one of his lesser wives, was implicated in an assassination attempt against the king, with the goal of putting her son pentawer on the throne. the coup was unsuccessful, as while the king apparently died from the attempt on his life, his legitimate heir and son ramesses iv succeeded him to the throne, arresting and putting approximately 30 conspirators to death.


==== ramesses iv ====
at the start of his reign ramesses iv started an enormous building program on the scale of ramesses the great's own projects. he doubled the number of work gangs at set maat to a total of 120 men and dispatched numerous expeditions to the stone quarries of wadi hammamat and the turquoise mines of the sinai. one of the largest expeditions included 8,368 men, of which some 2,000 were soldiers. ramesses expanded his father's temple of khonsu at karnak and possibly began his own mortuary temple at a site near the temple of hatshepsut. another smaller temple is associated with ramesses north of medinet habu.
ramesses iv saw issues with the provision of food rations to his workmen, similar to the situation under his father. ramessesnakht, the high priest of amun at the time, began to accompany state officials as they went to pay the workmen their rations, suggesting that, at least in part, it was the temple of amun and not the egyptian state that was responsible for their wages.he also produced the papyrus harris i, the longest known papyrus from ancient egypt, measuring in at 41 meters long with 1,500 lines of text to celebrate the achievements of his father.


==== ramesses v ====
ramesses v reigned for no more than 4 years, dying of smallpox in 1143 bc. the only monument attested to him is a stela near gebel el-silsila. the turin papyrus cat. 2044 attests that during his reign the workmen of set maat were forced to periodically stop working on ramesses' kv9 tomb out of ""fear of the enemy"", suggesting increasing instability in egypt and an inability to defend the country from what are presumed to be libyan raiding parties.the wilbour papyrus is thought to date from ramesses v's reign. the document reveals that most of the land in egypt by that point was controlled by the temple of amun, and that the temple had complete control over egypt's finances.


==== ramesses vi ====
ramesses vi is best known for his tomb which, when built, inadvertently buried the tomb of pharaoh tutankhamun underneath, keeping it safe from grave robbing until its discovery by howard carter in 1922.


==== ramesses vii ====
ramesses vii's only monument is his tomb, kv1.


==== ramesses viii ====
almost nothing is known about ramesses viii's reign, which lasted for a single year. he is only attested at medinet habu and through a few plaques. the only monument from his reign is his modest tomb, which was used for mentuherkhepeshef, son of ramesses ix, rather than ramesses viii himself.


==== ramesses ix ====
during year 16 and year 17 of ramesses ix's reign famous tomb robbery trials took place, as attested by the abbott papyrus. a careful examination by a vizierial commission was undertaken of ten royal tombs, four tombs of the chantresses of the estate of the divine adoratrix, and finally the tombs of the citizens of thebes. many of these were found to have been broken into, like the tomb of pharaoh sobekemsaf ii, whose mummy had been stolen.ramesses ix's cartouche has been found at gezer in canaan, suggesting that egypt at this time still had some degree of influence in the region.most of the building projects during ramesses ix's reign were at heliopolis.


==== ramesses x ====
ramesses x's reign is poorly documented. the necropolis journal of set maat records the general idleness of the workmen at this time, due, at least in part, to the danger of libyan raiders.


==== ramesses xi ====
ramesses xi was the last pharaoh of the 20th dynasty. during his reign the position grew so weak that in the south the high priests of amun at thebes became the de facto rulers of upper egypt, while smendes controlled lower egypt even before ramesses xi's death. smendes would eventually found the twenty-first dynasty at tanis.


=== decline ===
as happened under the earlier nineteenth dynasty, this dynasty struggled under the effects of the bickering between the heirs of ramesses iii. for instance, three different sons of ramesses iii are known to have assumed power as ramesses iv, ramesses vi and ramesses viii respectively. however, at this time egypt was also increasingly beset by a series of droughts, below-normal flooding levels of the nile, famine, civil unrest and official corruption – all of which would limit the managerial abilities of any king.


== pharaohs of the 20th dynasty ==
the pharaohs of the 20th dynasty ruled for approximately 120 years: from c. 1187 to 1064 bc. the dates and names in the table are mostly taken from ""chronological table for the dynastic period"" in erik hornung, rolf krauss & david warburton (editors), ancient egyptian chronology (handbook of oriental studies), brill, 2006. many of the pharaohs were buried in the valley of the kings in thebes (designated kv). more information can be found on the theban mapping project website.

transmembrane protein 127 (zebrafish),protein,"the notch signaling pathway is a highly conserved cell signaling system present in most animals. mammals possess four different notch receptors, referred to as notch1, notch2, notch3, and notch4. the notch receptor is a single-pass transmembrane receptor protein. it is a hetero-oligomer composed of a large extracellular portion, which associates in a calcium-dependent, non-covalent interaction with a smaller piece of the notch protein composed of a short extracellular region, a single transmembrane-pass, and a small intracellular region.notch signaling promotes proliferative signaling during neurogenesis, and its activity is inhibited by numb to promote neural differentiation. it plays a major role in the regulation of embryonic development.


== discovery ==
in 1914, john s. dexter noticed the appearance of a notch in the wings of the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster. the alleles of the gene were identified in 1917 by american evolutionary biologist thomas hunt morgan. its molecular analysis and sequencing was independently undertaken in the 1980s by spyros artavanis-tsakonas and michael w. young. alleles of the two c. elegans notch genes were identified based on developmental phenotypes: lin-12 and glp-1. the cloning and partial sequence of lin-12 was reported at the same time as drosophila notch by iva greenwald.


== mechanism of action ==

the notch protein spans the cell membrane, with part of it inside and part outside. ligand proteins binding to the extracellular domain induce proteolytic cleavage and release of the intracellular domain, which enters the cell nucleus to modify gene expression.the cleavage model was first proposed in 1993 based on work done with drosophila notch and c. elegans lin-12, informed by the first oncogenic mutation affecting a human notch gene. compelling evidence for this model was provided in 1998 by in vivo analysis in drosophila by gary struhl and in cell culture by raphael kopan. although this model was initially disputed, the evidence in favor of the model was irrefutable by 2001.the receptor is normally triggered via direct cell-to-cell contact, in which the transmembrane proteins of the cells in direct contact form the ligands that bind the notch receptor. the notch binding allows groups of cells to organize themselves such that, if one cell expresses a given trait, this may be switched off in neighbouring cells by the intercellular notch signal. in this way, groups of cells influence one another to make large structures. thus, lateral inhibition mechanisms are key to notch signaling. lin-12 and notch mediate binary cell fate decisions, and lateral inhibition involves feedback mechanisms to amplify initial differences.the notch cascade consists of notch and notch ligands, as well as intracellular proteins transmitting the notch signal to the cell's nucleus. the notch/lin-12/glp-1 receptor family was found to be involved in the specification of cell fates during development in drosophila and c. elegans.the intracellular domain of notch forms a complex with cbf1 and mastermind to activate transcription of target genes. the structure of the complex has been determined.


== function ==
the notch signaling pathway is important for cell-cell communication, which involves gene regulation mechanisms that control multiple cell differentiation processes during embryonic and adult life.
notch signaling also has a role in the following processes:

neuronal function and development
stabilization of arterial endothelial fate and angiogenesis
regulation of crucial cell communication events between endocardium and myocardium during both the formation of the valve primordial and ventricular development and differentiation
cardiac valve homeostasis, as well as implications in other human disorders involving the cardiovascular system
timely cell lineage specification of both endocrine and exocrine pancreas
influencing of binary fate decisions of cells that must choose between the secretory and absorptive lineages in the gut
expansion of the hematopoietic stem cell compartment during bone development and participation in commitment to the osteoblastic lineage, suggesting a potential therapeutic role for notch in bone regeneration and osteoporosis
expansion of the hemogenic endothelial cells along with signaling axis involving hedgehog signaling and scl 
t cell lineage commitment from common lymphoid precursor 
regulation of cell-fate decision in mammary glands at several distinct development stages
possibly some non-nuclear mechanisms, such as control of the actin cytoskeleton through the tyrosine kinase abl
regulation of the mitotic/meiotic decision in the c. elegans germlinenotch signaling is dysregulated in many cancers, and faulty notch signaling is implicated in many diseases including t-all (t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia), cadasil (cerebral autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with sub-cortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy), multiple sclerosis (ms), tetralogy of fallot, alagille syndrome, and many other disease states.
inhibition of notch signaling has been shown to have anti-proliferative effects on t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in cultured cells and in a mouse model.
it has also been found that rex1 has inhibitory effects on the expression of notch in mesenchymal stem cells, preventing differentiation.


== pathway ==
maturation of the notch receptor involves cleavage at the prospective extracellular side during intracellular trafficking in the golgi complex. this results in a bipartite protein, composed of a large extracellular domain linked to the smaller transmembrane and intracellular domain. binding of ligand promotes two proteolytic processing events; as a result of proteolysis, the intracellular domain is liberated and can enter the nucleus to engage other dna-binding proteins and regulate gene expression.
notch and most of its ligands are transmembrane proteins, so the cells expressing the ligands typically must be adjacent to the notch expressing cell for signaling to occur. the notch ligands are also single-pass transmembrane proteins and are members of the dsl (delta/serrate/lag-2) family of proteins. in drosophila melanogaster (the fruit fly), there are two ligands named delta and serrate. in mammals, the corresponding names are delta-like and jagged. in mammals there are multiple delta-like and jagged ligands, as well as possibly a variety of other ligands, such as f3/contactin.in the nematode c. elegans, two genes encode homologous proteins, glp-1 and lin-12. there has been at least one report that suggests that some cells can send out processes that allow signaling to occur between cells that are as much as four or five cell diameters apart.the notch extracellular domain is composed primarily of small cystine-rich motifs called egf-like repeats.notch 1, for example, has 36 of these repeats. each egf-like repeat is composed of approximately 40 amino acids, and its structure is defined largely by six conserved cysteine residues that form three conserved disulfide bonds. each egf-like repeat can be modified by o-linked glycans at specific sites. an o-glucose sugar may be added between the first and second conserved cysteines, and an o-fucose may be added between the second and third conserved cysteines. these sugars are added by an as-yet-unidentified o-glucosyltransferase (except for rumi), and gdp-fucose protein o-fucosyltransferase 1 (pofut1), respectively. the addition of o-fucose by pofut1 is absolutely necessary for notch function, and, without the enzyme to add o-fucose, all notch proteins fail to function properly. as yet, the manner by which the glycosylation of notch affects function is not completely understood.
the o-glucose on notch can be further elongated to a trisaccharide with the addition of two xylose sugars by xylosyltransferases, and the o-fucose can be elongated to a tetrasaccharide by the ordered addition of an n-acetylglucosamine (glcnac) sugar by an n-acetylglucosaminyltransferase called fringe, the addition of a galactose by a galactosyltransferase, and the addition of a sialic acid by a sialyltransferase.to add another level of complexity, in mammals there are three fringe glcnac-transferases, named lunatic fringe, manic fringe, and radical fringe. these enzymes are responsible for something called a ""fringe effect"" on notch signaling. if fringe adds a glcnac to the o-fucose sugar then the subsequent addition of a galactose and sialic acid will occur. in the presence of this tetrasaccharide, notch signals strongly when it interacts with the delta ligand, but has markedly inhibited signaling when interacting with the jagged ligand. the means by which this addition of sugar inhibits signaling through one ligand, and potentiates signaling through another is not clearly understood.
once the notch extracellular domain interacts with a ligand, an adam-family metalloprotease called adam10, cleaves the notch protein just outside the membrane. this releases the extracellular portion of notch (necd), which continues to interact with the ligand. the ligand plus the notch extracellular domain is then endocytosed by the ligand-expressing cell. there may be signaling effects in the ligand-expressing cell after endocytosis; this part of notch signaling is a topic of active research. after this first cleavage, an enzyme called γ-secretase (which is implicated in alzheimer's disease) cleaves the remaining part of the notch protein just inside the inner leaflet of the cell membrane of the notch-expressing cell. this releases the intracellular domain of the notch protein (nicd), which then moves to the nucleus, where it can regulate gene expression by activating the transcription factor csl. it was originally thought that these csl proteins suppressed notch target transcription. however, further research showed that, when the intracellular domain binds to the complex, it switches from a repressor to an activator of transcription. other proteins also participate in the intracellular portion of the notch signaling cascade.


== ligand interactions ==

notch signaling is initiated when notch receptors on the cell surface engage ligands presented in trans on opposing cells. despite the expansive size of the notch extracellular domain, it has been demonstrated that egf domains 11 and 12 are the critical determinants for interactions with delta. additional studies have implicated regions outside of notch egf11-12 in ligand binding. for example, notch egf domain 8 plays a role in selective recognition of serrate/jagged and egf domains 6-15 are required for maximal signaling upon ligand stimulation. a crystal structure of the interacting regions of notch1 and delta-like 4 (dll4) provided a molecular-level visualization of notch-ligand interactions, and revealed that the n-terminal mnnl (or c2) and dsl domains of ligands bind to notch egf domains 12 and 11, respectively. the notch1-dll4 structure also illuminated a direct role for notch o-linked fucose and glucose moieties in ligand recognition, and rationalized a structural mechanism for the glycan-mediated tuning of notch signaling.


== embryogenesis ==
the notch signaling pathway plays an important role in cell-cell communication, and further regulates embryonic development.


=== embryo polarity ===
notch signaling is required in the regulation of polarity. for example, mutation experiments have shown that loss of notch signaling causes abnormal anterior-posterior polarity in somites. also, notch signaling is required during left-right asymmetry determination in vertebrates.early studies in the nematode model organism c. elegans indicate that notch signaling has a major role in the induction of mesoderm and cell fate determination. as mentioned previously, c. elegans has two genes that encode for partially functionally redundant notch homologs, glp-1 and lin-12. during c. elegans, glp-1, the c. elegans notch homolog, interacts with apx-1, the c. elegans delta homolog. this signaling between particular blastomeres induces differentiation of cell fates and establishes the dorsal-ventral axis.


=== somitogenesis ===
notch signaling is central to somitogenesis. in 1995, notch1 was shown to be important for coordinating the segmentation of somites in mice. further studies identified the role of notch signaling in the segmentation clock. these studies hypothesized that the primary function of notch signaling does not act on an individual cell, but coordinates cell clocks and keep them synchronized. this hypothesis explained the role of notch signaling in the development of segmentation and has been supported by experiments in mice and zebrafish. experiments with delta1 mutant mice that show abnormal somitogenesis with loss of anterior/posterior polarity suggest that notch signaling is also necessary for the maintenance of somite borders.during somitogenesis, a molecular oscillator in paraxial mesoderm cells dictates the precise rate of somite formation. a clock and wavefront model has been proposed in order to spatially determine the location and boundaries between somites. this process is highly regulated as somites must have the correct size and spacing in order to avoid malformations within the axial skeleton that may potentially lead to spondylocostal dysostosis. several key components of the notch signaling pathway help coordinate key steps in this process. in mice, mutations in notch1, dll1 or dll3, lfng, or hes7 result in abnormal somite formation. similarly, in humans, the following mutations have been seen to lead to development of spondylocostal dysostosis: dll3, lfng, or hes7.


=== epidermal differentiation ===
notch signaling is known to occur inside ciliated, differentiating cells found in the first epidermal layers during early skin development. furthermore, it has found that presenilin-2 works in conjunction with arf4 to regulate notch signaling during this development. however, it remains to be determined whether gamma-secretase has a direct or indirect role in modulating notch signaling.


== central nervous system development and function ==

early findings on notch signaling in central nervous system (cns) development were performed mainly in drosophila with mutagenesis experiments. for example, the finding that an embryonic lethal phenotype in drosophila was associated with notch dysfunction indicated that notch mutations can lead to the failure of neural and epidermal cell segregation in early drosophila embryos. in the past decade, advances in mutation and knockout techniques allowed research on the notch signaling pathway in mammalian models, especially rodents.
the notch signaling pathway was found to be critical mainly for neural progenitor cell (npc) maintenance and self-renewal. in recent years, other functions of the notch pathway have also been found, including glial cell specification, neurites development, as well as learning and memory.


=== neuron cell differentiation ===
the notch pathway is essential for maintaining npcs in the developing brain. activation of the pathway is sufficient to maintain npcs in a proliferating state, whereas loss-of-function mutations in the critical components of the pathway cause precocious neuronal differentiation and npc depletion. modulators of the notch signal, e.g., the numb protein are able to antagonize notch effects, resulting in the halting of cell cycle and differentiation of npcs. conversely, the fibroblast growth factor pathway promotes notch signaling to keep stem cells of the cerebral cortex in the proliferative state, amounting to a mechanism regulating cortical surface area growth and, potentially, gyrification. in this way, notch signaling controls npc self-renewal as well as cell fate specification.
a non-canonical branch of the notch signaling pathway that involves the phosphorylation of stat3 on the serine residue at amino acid position 727 and subsequent hes3 expression increase (stat3-ser/hes3 signaling axis) has been shown to regulate the number of npcs in culture and in the adult rodent brain.in adult rodents and in cell culture, notch3 promotes neuronal differentiation, having a role opposite to notch1/2. this indicates that individual notch receptors can have divergent functions, depending on cellular context.


=== neurite development ===
in vitro studies show that notch can influence neurite development. in vivo, deletion of the notch signaling modulator, numb, disrupts neuronal maturation in the developing cerebellum, whereas deletion of numb disrupts axonal arborization in sensory ganglia. although the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is not clear, together these findings suggest notch signaling might be crucial in neuronal maturation.


=== gliogenesis ===
in gliogenesis, notch appears to have an instructive role that can directly promote the differentiation of many glial cell subtypes. for example, activation of notch signaling in the retina favors the generation of muller glia cells at the expense of neurons, whereas reduced notch signaling induces production of ganglion cells, causing a reduction in the number of muller glia.


=== adult brain function ===
apart from its role in development, evidence shows that notch signaling is also involved in neuronal apoptosis, neurite retraction, and neurodegeneration of ischemic stroke in the brain in addition to developmental functions, notch proteins and ligands are expressed in cells of the adult nervous system, suggesting a role in cns plasticity throughout life. adult mice heterozygous for mutations in either notch1 or cbf1 have deficits in spatial learning and memory. similar results are seen in experiments with presenilins1 and 2, which mediate the notch intramembranous cleavage. to be specific, conditional deletion of presenilins at 3 weeks after birth in excitatory neurons causes learning and memory deficits, neuronal dysfunction, and gradual neurodegeneration. several gamma secretase inhibitors that underwent human clinical trials in alzheimer's disease and mci patients resulted in statistically significant worsening of cognition relative to controls, which is thought to be due to its incidental effect on notch signalling.


== cardiovascular development ==
the notch signaling pathway is a critical component of cardiovascular formation and morphogenesis in both development and disease. it is required for the selection of endothelial tip and stalk cells during sprouting angiogenesis.


=== cardiac development ===
notch signal pathway plays a crucial role in at least three cardiac development processes: atrioventricular canal development, myocardial development, and cardiac outflow tract (oft) development.


==== atrioventricular (av) canal development ====
av boundary formationnotch signaling can regulate the atrioventricular boundary formation between the av canal and the chamber myocardium. studies have revealed that both loss- and gain-of-function of the notch pathway results in defects in av canal development. in addition, the notch target genes hey1 and hey2 are involved in restricting the expression of two critical developmental regulator proteins, bmp2 and tbx2, to the av canal.av epithelial-mesenchymal transition (emt)notch signaling is also important for the process of av emt, which is required for av canal maturation. after the av canal boundary formation, a subset of endocardial cells lining the av canal are activated by signals emanating from the myocardium and by interendocardial signaling pathways to undergo emt. notch1 deficiency results in defective induction of emt. very few migrating cells are seen and these lack mesenchymal morphology. notch may regulate this process by activating matrix metalloproteinase2 (mmp2) expression, or by inhibiting vascular endothelial (ve)-cadherin expression in the av canal endocardium while suppressing the vegf pathway via vegfr2. in rbpjk/cbf1-targeted mutants, the heart valve development is severely disrupted, presumably because of defective endocardial maturation and signaling.


==== ventricular development ====
some studies in xenopus and in mouse embryonic stem cells indicate that cardiomyogenic commitment and differentiation require notch signaling inhibition. active notch signaling is required in the ventricular endocardium for proper trabeculae development subsequent to myocardial specification by regulating bmp10, nrg1, and ephrinb2 expression. notch signaling sustains immature cardiomyocyte proliferation in mammals  and zebrafish.the downstream effector of notch signaling, hey2, was also demonstrated to be important in regulating ventricular development by its expression in the interventricular septum and the endocardial cells of the cardiac cushions. cardiomyocyte and smooth muscle cell-specific deletion of hey2 results in impaired cardiac contractility, malformed right ventricle, and ventricular septal defects.


==== ventricular outflow tract development ====
during development of the aortic arch and the aortic arch arteries, the notch receptors, ligands, and target genes display a unique expression pattern. when the notch pathway was blocked, the induction of vascular smooth muscle cell marker expression failed to occur, suggesting that notch is involved in the differentiation of cardiac neural crest cells into vascular cells during outflow tract development.


=== angiogenesis ===
endothelial cells use the notch signaling pathway to coordinate cellular behaviors during the blood vessel sprouting that occurs sprouting angiogenesis.activation of notch takes place primarily in ""connector"" cells and cells that line patent stable blood vessels through direct interaction with the notch ligand, delta-like ligand 4 (dll4), which is expressed in the endothelial tip cells. vegf signaling, which is an important factor for migration and proliferation of endothelial cells, can be downregulated in cells with activated notch signaling by lowering the levels of vegf receptor transcript. zebrafish embryos lacking notch signaling exhibit ectopic and persistent expression of the zebrafish ortholog of vegf3, flt4, within all endothelial cells, while notch activation completely represses its expression.notch signaling may be used to control the sprouting pattern of blood vessels during angiogenesis. when cells within a patent vessel are exposed to vegf signaling, only a restricted number of them initiate the angiogenic process. vegf is able to induce dll4 expression. in turn, dll4 expressing cells down-regulate vegf receptors in neighboring cells through activation of notch, thereby preventing their migration into the developing sprout. likewise, during the sprouting process itself, the migratory behavior of connector cells must be limited to retain a patent connection to the original blood vessel.


== endocrine development ==
during development, definitive endoderm and ectoderm differentiates into several gastrointestinal epithelial lineages, including endocrine cells. many studies have indicated that notch signaling has a major role in endocrine development.


=== pancreatic development ===
the formation of the pancreas from endoderm begins in early development. the expression of elements of the notch signaling pathway have been found in the developing pancreas, suggesting that notch signaling is important in pancreatic development. evidence suggests notch signaling regulates the progressive recruitment of endocrine cell types from a common precursor, acting through two possible mechanisms. one is the ""lateral inhibition"", which specifies some cells for a primary fate but others for a secondary fate among cells that have the potential to adopt the same fate. lateral inhibition is required for many types of cell fate determination. here, it could explain the dispersed distribution of endocrine cells within pancreatic epithelium. a second mechanism is ""suppressive maintenance"", which explains the role of notch signaling in pancreas differentiation. fibroblast growth factor10 is thought to be important in this activity, but the details are unclear.


=== intestinal development ===
the role of notch signaling in the regulation of gut development has been indicated in several reports. mutations in elements of the notch signaling pathway affect the earliest intestinal cell fate decisions during zebrafish development. transcriptional analysis and gain of function experiments revealed that notch signaling targets hes1 in the intestine and regulates a binary cell fate decision between adsorptive and secretory cell fates.


=== bone development ===
early in vitro studies have found the notch signaling pathway functions as down-regulator in osteoclastogenesis and osteoblastogenesis. notch1 is expressed in the mesenchymal condensation area and subsequently in the hypertrophic chondrocytes during chondrogenesis. overexpression of notch signaling inhibits bone morphogenetic protein2-induced osteoblast differentiation. overall, notch signaling has a major role in the commitment of mesenchymal cells to the osteoblastic lineage and provides a possible therapeutic approach to bone regeneration.


== respiratory system development ==
notch is implicated in development of alveoli in the lung.


== cancer ==


=== role of notch signaling in leukemia ===
aberrant notch signaling is a driver of t cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (t-all) and is mutated in at least 65% of all t-all cases. notch signaling can be activated by mutations in notch itself, inactivating mutations in fbxw7 (a negative regulator of notch1), or rarely by t(7;9)(q34;q34.3) translocation. in the context of t-all, notch activity cooperates with additional oncogenic lesions such as c-myc to activate anabolic pathways such as ribosome and protein biosynthesis thereby promoting leukemia cell growth.


=== notch inhibitors ===

the involvement of notch signaling in many cancers has led to investigation of notch inhibitors (especially gamma-secretase inhibitors) as cancer treatments which are in different phases of clinical trials. as of 2013 at least 7 notch inhibitors were in clinical trials. mk-0752 has given promising results in an early clinical trial for breast cancer. preclinical studies showed beneficial effects of gamma-secretase inhibitors in endometriosis, a disease characterised by increased expression of notch pathway constituents.


== synthetic notch signaling ==
it is possible to engineer synthetic notch receptors by replacing the extracellular receptor and intracellular transcriptional domains with other domains of choice. this allows researchers to select which ligands are detected, and which genes are upregulated in response. using this technology, cells can report or change their behavior in response to contact with user-specified signals, facilitating new avenues of both basic and applied research into cell-cell signaling. notably, this system allows multiple synthetic pathways to be engineered into a cell in parallel.

alagille syndrome"
syrians,non_science,"syrians (arabic: سوريون‎, sūriyyūn), also known as the syrian people (arabic: الشعب السوري‎, ala-lc: al-sha‘ab al-sūrī; syriac: ܣܘܪܝܝܢ‎), are the majority inhabitants of syria and share common levantine semitic roots. the cultural and linguistic heritage of the syrian people is a blend of both indigenous elements and the foreign cultures that have come to inhabit the region of syria and govern its people over the course of thousands of years. the mother tongue of most syrians is levantine arabic, which came to replace the former mother tongue, aramaic, in the aftermath of the muslim conquest of the levant in the 7th century. the conquest led to the establishment of the caliphate under successive arab dynasties, who, during the period of the abbasid caliphate, promoted the use of the arabic language. a minority of syrians retained aramaic which is still spoken in its eastern and western dialects. in 2018, the syrian arab republic had an estimated population of 19.5 million, which includes, aside from the aforementioned majority, ethnic minorities such as kurds, armenians, assyrians and others.
before the syrian civil war, the syrian diaspora consisted of 15 million people of syrian ancestry who immigrated to north america (united states and canada), european union member states (including sweden, france and germany), south america (mainly in brazil, argentina,  venezuela and colombia), the west indies, africa, australia and new zealand. six million refugees of the syrian civil war also live outside syria now, mostly in turkey.


== etymology ==
the name ""syrians"" was employed by the greeks and romans to denote the inhabitants of syria; however, they called themselves arameans and assyrians. the ethnic designation ""syrian"" is derived from the word ""assyrian"" and appeared in the hellenistic and roman periods. some argue that the çineköy inscription supports this theory.


=== applications of the name ===
the greeks used the terms ""syrian"" and ""assyrian"" interchangeably to indicate the indigenous arameans, assyrians and other inhabitants of the near east, herodotus considered ""syria"" west of the euphrates. starting from the 2nd century bc onwards, ancient writers referred to the ruler of the seleucid empire as the king of syria or king of the syrians. the seleucids designated the districts of seleucis and coele-syria explicitly as syria and ruled the syrians as indigenous populations residing west of the euphrates (aramea) in contrast to assyrians who had their native homeland in mesopotamia east of the euphrates. however, the interchangeability between assyrians and syrians persisted during the hellenistic period.in one instance, the ptolemaic dynasty of the hellenistic kingdom of egypt applied the term ""syrian village"" as the name of a settlement in fayoum. the term ""syrians"" is under debate whether it referred to jews or to arameans, as the ptolemies referred to all peoples originating from modern syria and palestine as syrian.the term syrian was imposed upon arameans of modern levant by the romans. pompey created the province of syria, which included modern-day lebanon and syria west of the euphrates, framing the province as a regional social category with civic implications. plutarch described the indigenous people of this newly created roman province as ""syrians"", so did strabo, who observed that syrians resided west of the euphrates in roman syria, and he explicitly mentions that those syrians are the arameans, whom he calls aramaei, indicating an extant ethnicity. posidonius noted that the people called syrians by the greeks refer to themselves as arameans.in his book the great roman-jewish war, josephus, a hebrew native to the levant, mentioned the syrians as the non-hebrew, non-greek indigenous inhabitants of syria.the arabs called the greater syria region al-sham (arabic: بِـلَاد الـشَّـام‎, romanized: bilād al-šām, lit. 'the country of sham'). the national and ethnic designation ""syrian"" is one that has been reused, accepted and espoused by the syrian people since the advent of modern nationalism, which emanated from europe and began with the culmination of the napoleonic wars of the early 1800s.


== history ==
 
syrians emerged from various origins; the main influence came from ancient semitic peoples, populations from arabia and mesopotamia, while greco-roman influence is marginal. ancient syria of the first millennium bc was dominated by the aramaeans; they originated in the northern levant as a continuum of the bronze age populations of syria. the seleucids ruled the syrians as a conquered nation; syrians were not assimilated into greek communities, and many local peasants were exploited financially as they had to pay rent for greek landlords. outside greek colonies, the syrians lived in districts governed by local temples that did not use the greek civic system of poleis and colonies. the situation changed after the roman conquest in 64 bc; syrians obtained the citizenship of greek poleis, and the line separating between the colonists and the colonized blurred. the idioms syrian and greek were used by rome to denote civic societies instead of separate ethnic groups.the aramaeans assimilated the earlier populations through their language; combined with the common religion, christianity, most of the inhabitants turned into syrians (aramaeans). islam and the arabic language had a similar effect where the aramaeans themselves became arabs regardless of their ethnic origin following the muslim conquest of the levant. the presence of arabs in syria is recorded since the 9th century bc, and roman period historians, such as strabo, pliny the elder, and ptolemy, reported that arabs inhabited many parts of syria. what antiquity's writers meant by the designation ""arab"" is debated; the historian michael macdonald suggested that the term is an ethnic designation based on an ""ill-defined complex of linguistic and cultural characteristics"", while according to academic consensus, ""arab"", in addition to it being an ethnic name, had a social meaning describing a nomadic way of life. the urheimat of the arab ethnos is unclear; the traditional 19th century theory locates this in the arabian peninsula, while some modern scholars, such as david frank graf, note that the epigraphic and archaeological evidence render the traditional theory inadequate to explain the arabs' appearance in syria. the arabs mentioned in syria by greco-roman writers were assimilated into the ""greco–aramaean culture"" that dominated the region, and the texts they produced were written in greek or aramaic; old arabic, the precursor of classical arabic, was not a written language, and its speakers used aramaic for writing purposes.


=== arabization ===
on the eve of the rashidun caliphate conquest of the levant, 634 ad, syria's population mainly spoke aramaic; greek was the official language of administration. arabization and islamization of syria began in the 7th century, and it took several centuries for islam, the arab identity, and language to spread; the arabs of the caliphate did not attempt to spread their language or religion in the early periods of the conquest, and formed an isolated aristocracy. the arabs of the caliphate accommodated many new tribes in isolated areas to avoid conflict with the locals; caliph uthman ordered his governor, muawiyah i, to settle the new tribes away from the original population. syrians who belonged to monophysitic denominations welcomed the peninsular arabs as liberators.the abbasids in the eighth and ninth century sought to integrate the peoples under their authority, and the arabization of the administration was one of the tools. arabization gained momentum with the increasing numbers of muslim converts; the ascendancy of arabic as the formal language of the state prompted the cultural and linguistic assimilation of syrian converts. those who remained christian also became arabized; it was probably during the abbasid period in the ninth century that christians adopted arabic as their first language; the first translation of the gospels into arabic took place in this century. many historians, such as claude cahen and bernard hamilton, proposed that the arabization of christians was completed before the first crusade. by the thirteenth century, arabic language achieved dominance in the region and its speakers became arabs.those who were able to avoid losing the aramaic language are divided between two groups:

the eastern aramaic syriac-speaking group, followers of the west syriac rite of the syriac orthodox church and the syrian catholic church; they kept the pre-islamic syrian (syriac) identity throughout the ages, asserting their culture in face of the arabic language dominance. linguists, such as carl brockelmann and françois lenormant, suggested that the rise of the garshuni writing (using syriac alphabet to write arabic) was an attempt by the syriac orthodox to assert their identity. syriac is still the liturgical language for most of the different syriac churches in syria. the syriac orthodox church was known as the syrian orthodox church until 2000, when the holy synod decided to rename it to avoid any nationalistic connotations; the catholic church still have ""syrian"" in its official name.
the western neo-aramaic-speaking group, that is, the inhabitants of bakh'a, jubb'adin and ma'loula. the residents of bakh'a and jubb'adin converted to islam in the eighteenth century, while in ma'loula, the majority are christians, mainly belonging to the melkite greek catholic church, but also to the greek orthodox church of antioch, in addition to a muslim minority, who speaks the same aramaic dialect of the christian residents. the people of those villages use arabic intensively to communicate with each other and the rest of the country; this led to a noticeable arabic influence on their aramaic language where around 20% of its vocabulary is of arabic roots. bakh'a is steadily losing its dialect; by 1971, people aged younger than 40 could no longer use the aramaic language properly, although they could understand it. the situation of bakh'a will eventually lead to the extinction of its aramaic dialect.


== identity ==
besides religious identities, the syrian people are split among three identities, the arab, syriac, and syrian identities. many muslims and some arabic-speaking christians describe themselves as arabs, while many aramaic-speaking christians and some muslims prefer to describe themselves as syriacs or arameans. also some people from syria, mainly syrian nationalists, describe themselves only as syrians or ethnic syrians. most of the divisions in ethnic nomenclature are actually due to religious backgrounds.

genetic tests on syrians were included in many genetic studies. the genetic marker which identifies descendants of the ancient levantines is found in syrians in high proportion. modern syrians exhibit ""high affinity to the levant"" based on studies comparing modern and ancient dna samples. syrians cluster closely with ancient levantine populations of the neolithic and bronze ages. a levantine ancestral genetic component was identified; it is estimated that the levantine and the arabian peninsula/east african ancestral components diverged 23,700-15,500 years ago, while the divergence between the levantine and european components happened 15,900-9,100 years ago. the levantine ancestral component is the most recurrent in levantines (42–68%); the arabian peninsula/east african ancestral components represent around 25% of syrian genetic make-up.the paternal y-dna haplogroup j1, which reaches its highest frequencies in yemen 72.6% and qatar 58.3%, accounted for 33.6% of syrians. the j2 group accounted for 20.8% of syrians; other y-dna haplogroups include the e1b1b 12.0%, i 5.0%, r1a 10.0% and r1b 15.0%. the syrians are closest to other levantine populations: the palestinians, lebanese and jordanians; this closeness can be explained with the common canaanite ancestry and geographical unity which was broken only in the twentieth century with the advent of british and french mandates. regarding the genetic relation between the syrians and the lebanese based on y-dna, muslims from lebanon show closer relation to syrians than their christian compatriots. the people of western syria show close relation with the people of northern lebanon.mitochondrial dna shows the syrians to have affinity with europe; main haplogroups are h and r. based on mitochondrial dna, the syrians, palestinian, lebanese and jordanians form a close cluster. compared to the lebanese, bedouins and palestinians, the syrians have noticeably more northern european component, estimated at 7%. regarding the hla alleles, syrians, and other levantine populations, exhibit ""key differences"" from other arab populations; based on hla-drb1 alleles, syrians were close to eastern mediterranean populations, such as the cretans and lebanese armenians. studying the genetic relation between jews and syrians showed that the two populations share close affinity. apparently, the cultural influence of arab expansion in the eastern mediterranean in the seventh century was more prominent than the genetic influx. however, the expansion of islam did leave an impact on levantine genes; religion drove levantine muslims to mix with other muslim populations, who were close culturally despite the geographic distance, and this produced genetic similarities between levantine muslims and moroccan and yemeni populations. christians and druze became a genetic isolate in the predominantly islamic world.


== language ==

arabic is the mother tongue of the majority of syrians as well as the official state language. the syrian variety of levantine arabic differs from modern standard arabic. western neo-aramaic, the only surviving western aramaic language, is still spoken in three villages (ma'loula, al-sarkha (bakhah) and jubb'adin) in the anti-lebanon mountains by both muslim and christian residents. syriac-assyrians in the northeast of the country are mainly surayt/turoyo speakers but there are also some speakers of assyrian neo-aramaic, especially in the khabour valley. classical syriac is also used as a liturgical language by syriac christians. english, and to a lesser extent french, is widely understood and used in interactions with tourists and other foreigners.


== religion and minority groups ==

religious differences in syria have historically been tolerated, and religious minorities tend to retain distinct cultural, and religious identities.
sunni islam is the religion of 74% of syrians. the alawites, a variety of shia islam, make up 12% of the population and mostly live in and around tartus and latakia. christians make up 10% of the country. most syrian christians adhere to the byzantine rite; the two largest are the antiochian orthodox church and the melkite greek catholic church. the druze are a mountainous people who reside in jabal al-druze who helped spark the great syrian revolt. the ismailis are an even smaller sect that originated in asia. many armenian and assyrian christians fled turkey during the armenian genocide and the assyrian genocide and settled in syria. there are also roughly 500,000 palestinians, who are mostly descendants of refugees from the 1948 israeli-arab war. the community of syrian jews inside syria once numbered 30,000 in 1947, but has only 200 today.the syrian people's beliefs and outlooks, similar to those of most arabs and people of the wider middle-east, are a mosaic of west and east. conservative and liberally minded people will live right next to each other. like the other countries in the region, religion permeates life; the government registers every syrian's religious affiliation. however, the number of non-believers in syria is increasing but there is no credible source or statistics to support this information.


== cuisine ==

syrian cuisine is dominated by ingredients native to the region. olive oil, garlic, olives, spearmint, and sesame oil are some of the ingredients that are used in many traditional meals. traditional syrian dishes enjoyed by syrians include, tabbouleh, labaneh, shanklish, wara' 'enab, makdous, kebab, kibbeh, sfiha, moutabal, hummus, mana'eesh, bameh, and fattoush.
a typical syrian breakfast is a meze. it is an assortment platter of foods with cheeses, pickles, olives, and spreads.  meze is usually served with arab-style tea - highly concentrated black tea, which is highly sweetened and served in small glass cups. another popular drink, especially with christians and non-practicing muslims, is the arak, a liquor produced from grapes or dates and flavored with anise that can have an alcohol content of over 90% abv (however, most commercial syrian arak brands are about 40-60% abv).

borel–cantelli lemma,non_science,"in probability theory, the borel–cantelli lemma is a theorem about sequences of events. in general, it is a result in measure theory.  it is named after émile borel and francesco paolo cantelli, who gave statement to the lemma in the first decades of the 20th century.  a related result, sometimes called the second borel–cantelli lemma, is a partial converse of the first borel–cantelli lemma.  the lemma states that, under certain conditions, an event will have probability of either zero or one. accordingly, it is the best-known of a class of similar theorems, known as zero-one laws. other examples include kolmogorov's zero–one law and the hewitt–savage zero–one law.


== statement of lemma for probability spaces ==
let e1,e2,... be a sequence of events in some probability space.
the borel–cantelli lemma states:
if the sum of the probabilities of the events {en} is finite
  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            n
            =
            1
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        pr
        (
        
          e
          
            n
          
        
        )
        <
        ∞
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }\pr(e_{n})<\infty ,}
  then the probability that infinitely many of them occur is 0, that is,
  
    
      
        pr
        
          (
          
            
              lim sup
              
                n
                →
                ∞
              
            
            
              e
              
                n
              
            
          
          )
        
        =
        0.
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pr \left(\limsup _{n\to \infty }e_{n}\right)=0.}
  here, ""lim sup"" denotes limit supremum of the sequence of events, and each event is a set of outcomes. that is, lim sup en is the set of outcomes that occur infinitely many times within the infinite sequence of events (en).  explicitly,

  
    
      
        
          lim sup
          
            n
            →
            ∞
          
        
        
          e
          
            n
          
        
        =
        
          ⋂
          
            n
            =
            1
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        
          ⋃
          
            k
            ≥
            n
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        
          e
          
            k
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \limsup _{n\to \infty }e_{n}=\bigcap _{n=1}^{\infty }\bigcup _{k\geq n}^{\infty }e_{k}.}
  the set lim sup en is sometimes denoted {en i.o. }. the theorem therefore asserts that if the sum of the probabilities of the events en is finite, then the set of all outcomes that are ""repeated"" infinitely many times must occur with probability zero. note that no assumption of independence is required.


=== example ===
suppose (xn) is a sequence of random variables with pr(xn = 0) = 1/n2 for each n. the probability that xn = 0 occurs for infinitely many n is equivalent to the probability of the intersection of infinitely many [xn = 0] events. the intersection of infinitely many such events is a set of outcomes common to all of them. however, the sum ∑pr(xn = 0) converges to π2/6 ≈ 1.645 < ∞, and so the borel–cantelli lemma states that the set of outcomes that are common to infinitely many such events occurs with probability zero. hence, the probability of xn = 0 occurring for infinitely many n is 0. almost surely (i.e., with probability 1), xn is nonzero for all but finitely many n.

== converse result ==
a related result, sometimes called the second borel–cantelli lemma, is a partial converse of the first borel–cantelli lemma. the lemma states: if the events en are independent and the sum of the probabilities of the en diverges to infinity, then the probability that infinitely many of them occur is 1. that is:

if  
  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            n
            =
            1
          
          
            ∞
          
        
        pr
        (
        
          e
          
            n
          
        
        )
        =
        ∞
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }\pr(e_{n})=\infty }
    and the events 
  
    
      
        (
        
          e
          
            n
          
        
        
          )
          
            n
            =
            1
          
          
            ∞
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (e_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty }}
    are independent, then  
  
    
      
        pr
        (
        
          lim sup
          
            n
            →
            ∞
          
        
        
          e
          
            n
          
        
        )
        =
        1.
      
    
    {\displaystyle \pr(\limsup _{n\rightarrow \infty }e_{n})=1.}
  the assumption of independence can be weakened to pairwise independence, but in that case the proof is more difficult.


=== example ===
the infinite monkey theorem, that endless typing at random will, with probability 1, eventually produce every finite text (such as the works of shakespeare), amounts to the statement that a (not necessarily fair) coin tossed infinitely often will eventually come up heads. this is a special case of the second lemma. 
the lemma can be applied to give a covering theorem in rn.  specifically (stein 1993, lemma x.2.1), if ej is a collection of lebesgue measurable subsets of a compact set in rn such that

  
    
      
        
          ∑
          
            j
          
        
        μ
        (
        
          e
          
            j
          
        
        )
        =
        ∞
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sum _{j}\mu (e_{j})=\infty ,}
  then there is a sequence fj of translates

  
    
      
        
          f
          
            j
          
        
        =

        +
        
          x
          
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f_{j}=e_{j}+x_{j}}
  such that

        sup
        
          f

== counterpart ==
another related result is the so-called counterpart of the borel–cantelli lemma.  it is a counterpart of the
lemma in the sense that it gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the limsup to be 1 by replacing the independence assumption by the completely different assumption that

1st army corps (soviet union),non_science,"the 1st army corps was an army corps of the soviet armed forces. it was formed in 1957 and finally deactivated in 1991. it draws its history from the 1st rifle corps, formed in 1922. troops of the 1st rifle corps participated in the winter war (november 1939 - march 1940) and world war ii.


== first formation ==
the corps was formed in june, 1922 in petrograd (currently saint-petersburg) as the 1st army corps (1 ak). creation of the corps was based on a directive of the commander number 195060/69, of 15 may 1922, order petrograd vo no.1416/383, 6 june 1922. in july 1922 it was named the 1st rifle corps. in 1926 corps headquarters was moved to novgorod, and in 1938 to pskov.
on may 15, 1939, the 75th rifle division (75th rd) was transferred from the 14th rifle corps (kharkov military district) and arrived in the leningrad military district. in september 1939, the 75th rifle division concentrated in the 1st rifle corps 8th army on the border with estonia.
in november 1939 the 75th rifle division arrived in schlusselburg (lenvo) where on vehicles it was transferred to karelia, as part of the 1st rifle corps, 8th army, lenvo. that same month corps headquarters was moved to petrozavodsk (november 1939 - april 1940).
corps headquarters was located at:

pskov (april - june 1940);
tartu (june - july 1940);
białystok ( from july 1940).the corps was a part of the:

petrograd military district (1922-1924);
leningrad military district (1924-1939);
8th army leningrad military district (november 1939 - july 1940 );
10th army western special military district (july 1940).the corps participated in the soviet-finnish war (1939-1940) (november 1939 - march 1940).
on june 22, 1941, at the beginning of operation barbarossa, the corps comprised the:
corps headquarters (bialystok) 
2nd rifle division (osovets)
8th rifle division (stavisky)
130th corps artillery regiment (łomża)
262nd corps artillery regiment
23rd separate communications battaliongeneral major f.d. rubtsov was the corps commander.
last mention in the boevoi sostav sovetskoi armii (combat composition of the soviet army, bssa) was on 1 july 1941 with the corps directly subordinated to the western front (soviet union).


== second formation ==
the corps reappeared in bssa on 1 june 1942 directly subordinated to the north caucasian front, and made up of four rifle brigades.  thereafter, the last 1942 bssa mention of the corps is on 1 august 1942.


== third formation and cold war ==
the 1st rifle corps reappears in the bssa on 1 september 1943 as part of the northwestern front. final mention on 1 may 1945 subordinated to the 1st shock army, leningrad front, and in command of the 306th, 344th, and 357th rifle divisions. the corps headquarters, as well as the 4th shock army, was moved to central asia after the end of the war and established at ashgabat. on 25 june 1957 it was renamed the 1st army corps.  in april 1970, the corps headquarters was moved to semipalatinsk, where in september 1981 it was raised in status to become 32nd army. a tank division may have moved to semipalatinsk alongside the corps headquarters.
32nd army was redesignated 1st army corps once again on 1 march 1988, but on 4 june 1991 the headquarters was again renamed to become 40th army.

splenic fibroblast,cell,"the red pulp of the spleen is composed of connective tissue known also as the cords of billroth and many splenic sinusoids that are engorged with blood, giving it a red color. its primary function is to filter the blood of antigens, microorganisms, and defective or worn-out red blood cells.the spleen is made of red pulp and white pulp, separated by the marginal zone; 76-79% of a normal spleen is red pulp. unlike white pulp, which mainly contains lymphocytes such as t cells, red pulp is made up of several different types of blood cells, including platelets, granulocytes, red blood cells, and plasma.the red pulp also acts as a large reservoir for monocytes. these monocytes are found in clusters in the billroth's cords (red pulp cords). the population of monocytes in this reservoir is greater than the total number of monocytes present in circulation. they can be rapidly mobilised to leave the spleen and assist in tackling ongoing infections.

the splenic sinusoids, are wide vessels that drain into pulp veins which themselves drain into trabecular veins. gaps in the endothelium lining the sinusoids mechanically filter blood cells as they enter the spleen. worn-out or abnormal red cells attempting to squeeze through the narrow intercellular spaces become badly damaged, and are subsequently devoured by macrophages in the red pulp. in addition to clearing aged red blood cells, the sinusoids also filter out cellular debris, particles that could clutter up the bloodstream.


== cells found in red pulp ==
red pulp consists of a dense network of fine reticular fiber, continuous with those of the splenic trabeculae, to which are applied flat, branching cells. the meshes of the reticulum are filled with blood:

white blood cells are found to be in larger proportion than they are in ordinary blood.
large rounded cells, termed splenic cells, are also seen; these are capable of ameboid movement, and often contain pigment and red-blood corpuscles in their interior.
the cells of the reticulum each possess a round or oval nucleus, and like the splenic cells, they may contain pigment granules in their cytoplasm; they do not stain deeply with carmine, and in this respect differ from the cells of the malpighian corpuscles.
in the young spleen, macrophages may also be found, each containing numerous nuclei or one compound nucleus.
nucleated red blood cells have also been found in the spleen of young animals.


=== red pulp macrophages ===
macrophages are highly diverse mononuclear phagocytes that are present throughout the body, including the spleen. those located in the red pulp are known as red pulp macrophages (rpms). they are necessary for maintaining blood homeostasis by performing phagocytosis upon injured and senescent erythrocytes and blood-borne particulates. evidence suggests that rpms are mainly produced during embryogenesis and are maintained during adult life. 
additionally, there are a number of cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors that regulate the development and survival of rpms, these factors being: spi-c, irf8/4, heme oxygenase-1 and m-csf. 
rpm's are capable of inducing the differentiation of regulatory t cells by the expression of transforming growth factor-β. they can also secrete type-1 interferons during parasitic infections.blood in the arteries end in the billroth's cords (red pulp cords). these cords are made up of fibroblasts and reticular fibres which form an open blood system without an endothelial lining, and it is within these cords that f4/80+ macrophages are found, which are associated with the reticular cells of these areas and are collectively known as red pulp macrophages. from the billroth's cords, the blood passes into the venous sinuses of the red pulp, which are lined with discontinuous endothelium as well as stress fibres extending under the basal plasma membrane, parallel to the cellular axis. this arrangement of the stress fibres combined with the parallel arrangement of the sinus endothelial cells forces the blood in the red pulp through slits that are formed by the stress fibres. however, this passage can become difficult for ageing red blood cells due to their less flexible membranes and therefore they get stuck in the cords and they will be subsequently phagocytosed by the red pulp macrophages. this process is known as erythrophagocytosis, which is important for the turnover of red blood cells and the recycling of iron, which is a major function of the red pulp macrophages and is made possible by this special structure of the red pulp. 
the iron from the red blood cells is either released by the red pulp macrophages or stored in the erythrocyte itself in the form of ferritin. also, the erythrocyte can store larger amounts of iron in the form of hemosiderin (an insoluble complex of partially degraded ferritin), and large deposits of this can be seen in the red pulp macrophages. the red pulp macrophages also obtain iron by scavenging a complex of haemoglobin (released from erythrocytes destroyed intravascularly throughout the body) and haptoglobin, via endocytosis through cd163. the iron stored in the splenic macrophages is released in accordance with the requirements of the bone marrow.


== diseases ==
in lymphoid leukemia, the white pulp of the spleen hypertrophies and the red pulp shrinks. in some cases the white pulp can swell to 50% of the total volume of the spleen. in myeloid leukemia, the white pulp atrophies and the red pulp expands.

thyroxine oral powder,drug,"desiccated thyroid, also known as thyroid extract, is thyroid gland that has been dried and powdered for medical use. it is used to treat hypothyroidism. it is less preferred than levothyroxine. it is taken by mouth. maximal effects may take up to 3 weeks to occur.side effects may occur from excessive doses. this may include weight loss, fever, headache, anxiety, trouble sleeping, arrythmias, and heart failure. other side effects may include allergic reactions. use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is generally safe. regular blood tests are recommended to verify the appropriateness of the dose. they contain a mixture of thyroxine (t4) and triiodothyronine (t3).desiccated thyroid has been used since the late 1800s. it is usually made from pigs, sheep, or cows. it is available as a generic medication. in 2017, it was the 130th most commonly prescribed medication in the united states, with more than five million prescriptions. usage has decreased since the 1960s.


== medical uses ==
the american association of clinical endocrinologists and the royal college of physicians recommend against the use of thyroid extract for the treatment of hypothyroidism. concerns include the potential for adverse effects from superphysiological levels of t3 and the absence of long-term safety data from randomized clinical trials. they recommend levothyroxine as the preferred treatment. some practitioners refuse to use desiccated thyroid.about 65 mg of thyroid extract is equivalent to 100 μg of levothyroxine.arguments against desiccated thyroid include:

desiccated thyroid preparations have a greater variability from batch to batch than synthetic ones.
desiccated thyroid has roughly a 4:1 ratio of thyroxine (t4) to triiodothyronine (t3).  in humans, the ratio is 11:1.
a combination of various ratios of t4 and t3 may not provide benefits over t4 alone. some controlled trials have shown inconsistent benefits of various ratios of t4 and t3.
the use of desiccated thyroid is usually accompanied with the practice of dosing according to symptoms instead of dosing to achieve ""ideal"" lab results (e.g. serum levels of tsh).  while there is debate as to what the ideal serum levels are, dosing according to symptoms often results in higher dosages.  most endocrinologists are opposed to these higher dosages as there may be risks of hyperthyroidism and osteoporosis.
the preference for ""natural"" treatment seems to stem from philosophical belief as opposed to science.


== chemistry ==
desiccated thyroid has been described in the united states pharmacopoeia for a century as the cleaned, dried, and powdered thyroid gland previously deprived of connective tissue and fat... obtained from domesticated animals that are used for food by man (usp xvi). in the last few decades, pork alone is the usual source. before modern assays, the potency was specified only by iodine content (""not less than 0.17% and not more than 0.23%""), rather than hormonal content or activity.


== history ==
the earliest oral treatment for hypothyroidism consisted of thyroid extract. george redmayne murray of the united kingdom first described treatment of myxedema with thyroid extract in 1891, and published a description of long-term successful treatment (28 years) of a patient with myxedema (severe hypothyroidism) in 1920 his treatment was quickly adopted in north america and europe. the first recorded american use dates to 1891 by a woman who was still taking it 52 years later at 84 years of age desiccated thyroid extract is prepared from pig thyroid glands. the glands are dried (desiccated), ground to powder, combined with binder chemicals, and pressed into pills. this was a new use for parts that were previously unwanted slaughterhouse offal, and armour and company, the dominant american meatpacker in the 20th century, supplied the best-known brand of thyroid extract.replacement by thyroid extract in hypothyroidism was one of the most effective treatments of any disease available to physicians before the middle of the 20th century, and in severe cases afforded dramatic relief of the myriad symptoms. the decision to treat was usually based on the presence of signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism because there were no accurate, readily available laboratory tests of thyroid function. many less severe cases of hypothyroidism went untreated. dosage was regulated by improvement of symptoms.
desiccated thyroid became a commercial treatment option in 1934 with westhroid,. in the early 1960s, desiccated thyroid hormones (thyroid extract) began to be replaced by  levothyroxine (synthetic t4), or by combinations of t4 and t3. replacement occurred faster in the united kingdom than in north america, but by the 1980s more patients were being prescribed synthetic t4 (levothyroxine) or synthetic t4/t3 combinations than desiccated thyroid extract.several reasons have been identified as to why prescriptions changed from desiccated thyroid treatment. 

although thyroid extract was useful and usually effective, some patients continued to complain of fatigue, weight gain, or other symptoms. dosing until the 1960s was often a matter of prolonged adjustment trials.
it was known that not all of the iodine content of thyroid extract was in the form of effective t4 and t3 and that actual content of available preparations varied more than the permitted 15%. it was hoped that better dosing precision with levothyroxine (synthetic) alone would increase the proportion of patients effectively treated. in 1980, a widely publicized investigation published in jama revealed continued large ranges of hormone content and potency in all of the available thyroid extracts on the american market.
by the 1960s, it was known that thyroxine was the essential hormone produced by the thyroid gland, and that most t3 was manufactured in other parts of the body by deiodination of thyroxine. it was demonstrated in hypothyroid animals and people that replacement of thyroxine alone corrected the measurable manifestations (laboratory test results) of hypothyroidism. by the 1970s doctors could measure t4, t3, and tsh in human blood with approximate accuracy and confirmed that treatment with thyroxine alone could produce normal blood levels of both t4 and t3, but desiccated thyroid caused supraphysiologic levels of t3. in the majority of patients normalization of these levels eliminated all signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism.
it was discovered that a healthy person varied the amount of t3 produced from t4 in response to changing needs and conditions and it seemed wiser not to bypass this control system by providing larger amounts of t3 than were naturally produced each day.
furthermore, when t3 could be measured, it was discovered that thyroid extract and synthetic combinations of t4 and t3 produced significantly greater fluctuations of t3 throughout the day than occurred in healthy people or hypothyroid people treated with thyroxine alone.
endocrinologists found that treatment with thyroxine alone worked as well or better than thyroid extract for the majority of patients, although even thyroxine did not reverse all the symptoms of a minority.thyroid care changed in other ways as well. accurate t4 and t3 measurements became widely used in the 1970s, and by the late 1980s, tsh measurement had become sensitive enough to detect mild degrees of hyperthyroidism and overtreatment. blood levels of thyroid hormones and tsh were found to be the best predictors of objective benefits from thyroid replacement: those with the most severe measurable deficiency enjoyed the most dramatic and sustained benefits. it was also discovered that even mild hyperthyroidism as defined by a suppressed tsh level, whether due to disease or overtreatment, was associated with poorer bone density in women, and with higher rates of atrial fibrillation in elderly patients.

pon farr,non_science,"pon farr  is a phenomenon in the fictional star trek universe. a part of the reproductive cycle of vulcans, pon farr features in the canonical television series as well as in various spin-offs and fan fiction. an extreme physical and psychological imbalance every seven years requires a mating ritual or death can ensue.


== description ==
every seven years, vulcan males and females become aroused. if they do not mate with someone with whom they are empathically bonded they eventually enter plak tow, the blood fever, become violent, and finally die unless they mate with someone or engage in a ritual battle known as kal-if-fee.
a common misconception associated with the series (and spock in particular) is that vulcans only have sex once every seven years. however, pon farr is not coincident with the sex lives of vulcans, and they are able to have intercourse without the affliction, and thus more than once every seven years. star trek: the original series writer and continuity story editor d. c. fontana explains that pon farr is not the only time that vulcans feel sexual desire or engage in sexual activity:

vulcans mate normally any time they want to. however, every seven years you do the ritual, the ceremony, the whole thing. the biological urge. you must, but any other time is any other emotion—humanoid emotion—when you're in love. when you want to, you know when the urge is there, you do it. this every-seven-years business was taken too literally by too many people who don't stop and understand. we didn't mean it only every seven years. i mean, every seven years would be a little bad, and it would not explain the vulcans of many different ages which are not seven years apart.
vulcans not only are able to mate outside pon farr, they are also able to mate with species other than vulcan: e.g., in star trek: the original series, spock's parents are human/vulcan couple; in star trek: enterprise, t'pol, a vulcan, has a romantic and sexual relationship with trip, a human; and, in the star trek reboot, spock is in a relationship with lt. uhura.


== in star trek canon ==
pon farr was introduced and prominently featured in the original star trek series episode ""amok time"", written by theodore sturgeon. in the episode, mr. spock experiences pon farr and is returned to his home planet vulcan by captain kirk and dr. mccoy to undergo the mating ritual and save his life.
additionally, spock experienced an accelerated version of pon farr due to the genesis planet's influence in star trek iii: the search for spock, as a young man. he was aided by fellow half-vulcan, saavik.
in the voyager episode ""blood fever"" vulcan ensign vorik experiences pon farr and attempts to mate with b'elanna torres.  due to a partial empathic bond, torres experiences pon farr as well.  vorik attempts to control the pon farr through meditation, drugs and a holodeck mate, while torres, trapped on an away mission, nearly mates with tom paris.  the pon farr is eventually resolved when torres and vorik battle together in the ritual fight kun-ut kal-if-fee on the planet.
also on voyager, tuvok experienced pon farr while the vessel was trapped far away from any other vulcans, and so was unable to mate with his wife. initially he claimed that he had tarkalean flu to the crew to spare the embarrassment of discussing his actual condition. he attempted to control the pon farr through meditation and drugs, but he was ultimately not successful. finally, tom paris, whose hobby is creating holographic novels, creates a holodeck program with a reproduction of his wife, which proves sufficient for tuvok, but ""no substitute for my wife"".
while originally described as an experience restricted to male vulcans, the character t'pol underwent pon farr as a result of an exposure to alien bacteria in the episode ""bounty"" from the star trek series enterprise.


== in other media ==
dilbert had a series of comics depicting engineers as suffering from pon farr.
the futurama episode ""why must i be a crustacean in love?"" closely parodies pon farr, with the character dr. zoidberg returning to his home planet decapod 10 for his species' mating ritual. in an ironic twist, zoidberg's life would end if he mated.
in the simpsons episode ""they saved lisa's brain"", comic book guy, representing an intellectual junta that briefly ran the town, proposes pon farr to limit breeding to once every seven years, commenting that this would mean much less breeding for most, but for him, ""much, much more"".

cytohesin-2 isoform 1 (rat),protein,"aldolase a (aldoa, or alda), also known as fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the aldoa gene on chromosome 16.
the protein encoded by this gene is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (g3p) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (dhap). three aldolase isozymes (a, b, and c), encoded by three different genes, are differentially expressed during development. aldolase a is found in the developing embryo and is produced in even greater amounts in adult muscle. aldolase a expression is repressed in adult liver, kidney and intestine and similar to aldolase c levels in brain and other nervous tissue. aldolase a deficiency has been associated with myopathy and hemolytic anemia. alternative splicing and alternative promoter usage results in multiple transcript variants. related pseudogenes have been identified on chromosomes 3 and 10. [provided by refseq, aug 2011]


== structure ==
aldoa is a homotetramer and one of the three aldolase isozymes (a, b, and c), encoded by three different genes. the aldoa gene contains 8 exons and the 5' utr ib. key amino acids responsible for its catalytic function have been identified. the residue tyr363 functions as the acid–base catalyst for protonating c3 of the substrate, while lys146 is proposed to stabilize the negative charge of the resulting conjugate base of tyr363 and the strained configuration of the c-terminal. residue glu187 participates in multiple functions, including fbp aldolase catalysis, acid–base catalysis during substrate binding, dehydration, and substrate cleavage. though aldoa localizes to the nucleus, it lacks any known nuclear localization signals (nls).


== mechanism ==
in mammalian aldolase, the key catalytic amino acid residues involved in the reaction are lysine and tyrosine. the tyrosine acts as an efficient hydrogen acceptor while the lysine covalently binds and stabilizes the intermediates. many bacteria use two magnesium ions in place of the lysine.

the numbering of the carbon atoms indicates the fate of the carbons according to their position in fructose 6-phosphate.


== function ==
aldoa is a key enzyme in the fourth step of glycolysis, as well as in the reverse pathway gluconeogenesis. it catalyzes the reversible conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate by aldol cleavage of the c3–c4 bond. as a result, it is a crucial player in atp biosynthesis. aldoa also contributes to other ""moonlighting"" functions such as muscle maintenance, regulation of cell shape and motility, striated muscle contraction, actin cytoskeleton organization, and regulation of cell proliferation. aldoa likely regulates actin cytoskeleton remodeling through interacting with cytohesin-2 (arno) and arf6.aldoa is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues, though it is predominantly expressed in developing embryo and adult muscle. in lymphocytes, aldoa is the predominant aldolase isoform. within the cell, aldoa typically localizes to the cytoplasm, but it can localize to the nucleus during dna synthesis of the cell cycle s phase. this nuclear localization is regulated by the protein kinases akt and p38. it is suggested that the nucleus serves as a reservoir for aldoa in low glucose conditions. aldoa has also been found in mitochondria.aldoa is regulated by the energy metabolism substrates glucose, lactate, and glutamine. in human mast cells (mcs), aldoa has been observed to undergo post-translational regulation by protein tyrosine nitration, which may alter its relative affinity for fbp and/or ip3. this change then affects ip3 and plc signaling cascades in ige-dependent responses.


== clinical significance ==
aldolase a (aldoa) is a highly expressed in multiple cancers, including lung squamous cell carcinoma (lscc), renal cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. it is proposed that aldoa overexpression enhances glycolysis in these tumor cells, promoting their growth. in lscc, its upregulation correlates with metastasis and poor prognosis, while its downregulation reduces tumor cell motility and tumorigenesis. thus, aldoa could be a potential lscc biomarker and therapeutic drug target.aldolase a deficiency is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder that is linked to hemolysis and accompanied by weakness, muscle pain, and myopathy.

ethambutol,antibiotic,"ethambutol (emb, e) is a medication primarily used to treat tuberculosis. it is usually given in combination with other tuberculosis medications, such as isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide. it may also be used to treat mycobacterium avium complex, and mycobacterium kansasii. it is taken by mouth.common side effects include problems with vision, joint pain, nausea, headaches, and feeling tired. other side effects include liver problems and allergic reactions. it is not recommended in people with optic neuritis, significant kidney problems, or under the age of five. use during pregnancy or breastfeeding has not been found to cause harm. in the united states the fda has raised concerns about eye issues in the baby if used during pregnancy. ethambutol is believed to work by interfering with the bacteria's metabolism.ethambutol was discovered in 1961. it is on the world health organization's list of essential medicines and is available as a generic medication.


== medical uses ==
ethambutol is used along with other medications to treat a number of infections including: tuberculosis, mycobacterium avium complex, and mycobacterium kansasii.


== adverse effects ==
optic neuritis (hence contraindicated in children below six years of age)
red-green color blindness people taking ethambutol should be monitored for changes in visual acuity and color discrimination.
arthralgia
hyperuricaemia
vertical nystagmus
milk skin reaction


== mechanism of action ==
ethambutol is bacteriostatic against actively growing tb bacilli. it works by obstructing the formation of cell wall. mycolic acids attach to the 5'-hydroxyl groups of d-arabinose residues of arabinogalactan and form mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex in the cell wall. it disrupts arabinogalactan synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme arabinosyl transferase. disruption of the arabinogalactan synthesis inhibits the formation of this complex and leads to increased permeability of the cell wall.


== pharmacokinetics ==
it is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and well distributed in body tissues and fluids.  50% is excreted unchanged in urine.

falconer's formula,non_science,"heritability is the proportion of variance caused by genetic factors and environmental factors of a specific trait in population. falconer's formula is a mathematical formula that is used in twin studies to estimate the relative contribution of genetics vs. environment to variation in a particular trait (that is, the heritability of the trait) based on the difference between twin correlations. statistical models for heritability commonly include an error that will absorb phenotypic variation that cannot be described by genetics when analyzed. these are unique subject-specific influences on a trait. falconer's formula was first proposed by the scottish geneticist douglas falconer.the formula is

hb2 = 2(rmz - rdz)where hb2 is the broad sense heritability, rmz is the (monozygotic, mz) identical twin correlation, and rdz is the (dizygotic, dz) fraternal twin correlation. falconer's formula assumes the equal contribution of environmental factors in mz pairs and dz pairs. therefore, additional phenotypic correlation between the two pairs is due to genetic factors. subtracting the correlation of the dz pairs from mz pairs yields the variance in phenotypes contributed by genetic factors. the correlation of same sex mz twins is always higher than the dz twin correlation with various sexes and thus all gender differences are evaluated as heritable. to avoid this error, only genetic studies comparing mz twins with the same sex dz twins are valid. correlations between a = hb2 (additive genetics) and c (common environment) must be included in the derivation shown below.

rmz = a + c + 2 corr(a,c)
rdz = ½a + c + 2 corr(½a,c)

william henry wakefield,non_science,"william henry wakefield (1828–1889) was an english banker.  wakefield was a partner in wakefield crewdson & co., the family bank in to which his father brought him.  he became the senior partner of the bank in 1864. through the bank he was involved in railways and gunpowder manufacturing.


== early years ==
he belonged to the kendal banking family of wakefield, as the son of john wakefield iii. the wakefields were quakers, but his father had been disowned by the kendal society of friends on marrying an anglican. he was born at broughton lodge near cartmel, on 18 may 1828, one of six children of john wakefield and fanny mcarthur of glasgow.


== career ==
wakefield was a partner in wakefield crewdson & co., the family bank to which his father brought him in, during 1850; and a gunpowder manufacturer. in 1863 the wakefield family took on a majority share of the bank; in 1864 wakefield became the senior partner.wakefield was a director of the south durham and lancashire union railway, a cross-pennine venture to connect furness to the north-east in which kendal men were well represented. he was also a landowner, with over 5000 acres in westmorland in 1873.in 1858 wakefield built a house at prizett, 2.5 miles south of kendal. after his father's death in 1866, he had a 7/16 share of the bank, and set about building sedgwick house, nearby. it replaced the old house of the same name, just to the north-west on the same site. he also supported the building of st thomas' church, crosscrake, which used the same architects, paley and austin, as sedgwick house. with sir francis powell he succeeding in turning round sedbergh school, when it was close to collapse.


== death ==

wakefield died while hunting. the gunpowder company w. h. wakefield & co. continued into the 20th century. the kendal bank was bought by the bank of liverpool in 1893.


== family ==
he married augusta, daughter of james hagarty, us consul at liverpool. their children, four sons and three daughters, included mary augusta wakefield (1853–1910), organiser of music festivals.

amikacin,antibiotic,"amikacin is an antibiotic medication used for a number of bacterial infections. this includes joint infections, intra-abdominal infections, meningitis, pneumonia, sepsis, and urinary tract infections. it is also used for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. it is used by injection into a vein using an iv or into a muscle.amikacin, like other aminoglycoside antibiotics, can cause hearing loss, balance problems, and kidney problems. other side effects include paralysis, resulting in the inability to breathe. if used during pregnancy it may cause permanent deafness in the baby. amikacin works by blocking the function of the bacteria's 30s ribosomal subunit, making it unable to produce proteins.amikacin was patented in 1971, and came into commercial use in 1976. it is on the world health organization's list of essential medicines. it is derived from kanamycin.


== medical uses ==
amikacin is most often used for treating severe infections with multidrug-resistant, aerobic gram-negative bacteria, especially pseudomonas, acinetobacter, enterobacter, e. coli, proteus, klebsiella, and serratia. the only gram-positive bacteria that amikacin strongly affects are staphylococcus and nocardia. amikacin can also be used to treat non-tubercular mycobacterial infections and tuberculosis (if caused by sensitive strains) when first-line drugs fail to control the infection. it is rarely used alone.it is often used in the following situations:
bronchiectasis
bone and joint infections
granulocytopenia, when combined with ticarcillin, in people with cancer
intra-abdominal infections (such as peritonitis) as an adjunct to other medicines, like clindamycin, metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam, or ampicillin/sulbactam
meningitis:
for meningitis by e. coli, as an adjunct to imipenem
for meningitis caused by pseudomonas, as an adjunct to meropenem
for meningitis caused by acetobacter, as an adjunct to imipenem or colistin
for neonatal meningitis caused by streptococcus agalactiae or listeria monocytogenes, as an adjunct to ampicillin
for neonatal meningitis caused by gram negative bacteria such as e. coli, as adjunct to a 3rd-generation cephalosporin
mycobacterial infections, including as a second-line agent for active tuberculosis. it is also used for infections by mycobacterium avium, m. abcessus, m. chelonae, and m. fortuitum.
rhodococcus equi, which causes an infection resembling tuberculosis
respiratory tract infections, including as an adjunct to beta-lactams or carbapenem for hospital-acquired pneumonia
sepsis, including that in neonates, as an adjunct to beta-lactams or carbapenem
skin and suture-site infections
urinary tract infections that are caused by bacteria resistant to less toxic drugs (often by enterobacteriaceae or p. aeruginosa)amikacin may be combined with a beta-lactam antibiotic for empiric therapy for people with neutropenia and fever.


=== available forms ===
amikacin may be administered once or twice a day and is usually given by the intravenous or intramuscular route, though it can be given via nebulization. there is no oral form available, as amikacin is not absorbed orally. in people with kidney failure, dosage must be adjusted according to the creatinine clearance, usually by reducing the dosing frequency. in people with a cns infection such as meningitis, amikacin can be given intrathecally (by direct injection into the spine) or intraventricularly (by injection into the ventricles of brain).an liposome inhalation suspension is also available and approved to treat mycobacterium avium complex (mac) in the united states. the application for arikayce was withdrawn in the european union because the committee for medicinal products for human use (chmp) was of the opinion that the benefits of arikayce did not outweigh its risks.


=== special populations ===
amikacin should be used in smaller doses in the elderly, who often have age-related decreases in kidney function, and children, whose kidneys are not fully developed yet. it is considered pregnancy category d in both the united states and australia, meaning they have a probability of harming the fetus. around 16% of amikacin crosses the placenta; while the half-life of amikacin in the mother is 2 hours, it is 3.7 hours in the fetus. a pregnant woman taking amikacin with another aminoglycoside has a possibility of causing congenital deafness in her child. while it is known to cross the placenta, amikacin is only partially secreted in breast milk.in general, amikacin should be avoided in infants. infants also tend to have a larger volume of distribution due to their higher concentration of extracellular fluid, where aminoglycosides reside.the elderly tend to have amikacin stay longer in their system; while the average clearance of amikacin in a 20-year-old is 6 l/hr, it is 3 l/hr in an 80-year-old.clearance is even higher in people with cystic fibrosis.in people with muscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis or parkinson's disease, amikacin's paralytic effect on neuromuscular junctions can worsen muscle weakness.


== adverse effects ==
side-effects of amikacin are similar to those of other aminoglycosides. kidney damage and ototoxicity (which can lead to hearing loss) are the most important effects, occurring in 1–10% of users. the nephro- and ototoxicity are thought to be due to aminoglycosides' tendency to accumulate in the kidneys and inner ear.

amikacin can cause neurotoxicity if used at a higher dose or for longer than recommended. the resulting effects of neurotoxicity include vertigo, numbness, tingling of the skin (paresthesia), muscle twitching, and seizures. its toxic effect on the 8th cranial nerve causes ototoxicity, resulting in loss of balance and, more commonly, hearing loss. damage to the cochlea, caused by the forced apoptosis of the hair cells, leads to the loss of high-frequency hearing and happens before any clinical hearing loss can be detected. damage to the ear vestibules, most likely by creating excessive oxidative free radicals. it does so in a time-dependent rather than dose-dependent manner, meaning that risk can be minimized by reducing the duration of use.amikacin causes nephrotoxicity (damage to the kidneys), by acting on the proximal renal tubules. it easily ionizes to a cation and binds to the anionic sites of the epithelial cells of the proximal tubule as part of receptor-mediated pinocytosis. the concentration of amikacin in the renal cortex becomes ten times that of amikacin in the plasma; it then most likely interferes with the metabolism of phospholipids in the lysosomes, which causes lytic enzymes to leak into the cytoplasm. nephrotoxicity results in increased serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, red blood cells, and white blood cells, as well as albuminuria (increased output of albumin in the urine), glycosuria (excretion of glucose into the urine), decreased urine specific gravity, and oliguria (decrease in overall urine output). it can also cause urinary casts to appear. the changes in renal tubular function also change the electrolyte levels and acid-base balance in the body, which can lead to hypokalemia and acidosis or alkalosis. nephrotoxicity is more common in those with pre-existing hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, acidosis, low glomerular filtration rate, diabetes mellitus, dehydration, fever, and sepsis, as well as those taking antiprostaglandins. the toxicity usually reverts once the antibiotic course has been completed, and can be avoided altogether by less frequent dosing (such as once every 24 hours rather than once every 8 hours).amikacin can cause neuromuscular blockade (including acute muscular paralysis) and respiratory paralysis (including apnea).rare side effects (occurring in fewer than 1% of users) include allergic reactions, skin rash, fever, headaches, tremor, nausea and vomiting, eosinophilia, arthralgia, anemia, hypotension, and hypomagnesemia. in intravitreous injections (where amikacin is injected into the eye), macular infarction can cause permanent vision loss.the amikacin liposome inhalation suspension prescribing information includes a boxed warning regarding the increased risk of respiratory conditions including hypersensitivity pneumonitis (inflamed lungs), bronchospasm (tightening of the airway), exacerbation of underlying lung disease and hemoptysis (spitting up blood) that have led to hospitalizations in some cases. other common side effects in patients taking amikacin liposome inhalation suspension are dysphonia (difficulty speaking), cough, ototoxicity (damaged hearing), upper airway irritation, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, diarrhea and nausea.


== contraindications ==
amikacin should be avoided in those who are sensitive to any aminoglycoside, as they are cross-allergenic (that is, an allergy to one aminoglycoside also confers hypersensitivity to other aminoglycosides). it should also be avoided in those sensitive to sulfite (seen more among people with asthma), since most amikacin usually comes with sodium metabisulfite, which can cause an allergic reaction.in general, amikacin should not be used with or just before/after another drug that can cause neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, or nephrotoxicity. such drugs include other aminoglycosides; the antiviral acyclovir; the antifungal amphotericin b; the antibiotics bacitracin, capreomycin, colistin, polymyxin b, and vancomycin; and cisplatin, which is used in chemotherapy.amikacin should not be used with neuromuscular blocking agents, as they can increase muscle weakness and paralysis.


== interactions ==
amikacin can be inactivated by other beta-lactams, though not to the extent as other aminoglycosides, and is still often used with penicillins (a type of beta-lactam) to create an additive effect against certain bacteria, and carbapenems, which can have a synergistic against some gram-positive bacteria. another group of beta-lactams, the cephalosporins, can increase the nephrotoxicity of aminoglycoside as well as randomly elevating creatinine levels. the antibiotics chloramphenicol, clindamycin, and tetracycline have been known to inactivate aminoglycosides in general by pharmacological antagonism.the effect of amikacin is increased when used with drugs derived from the botulinum toxin, anesthetics, neuromuscular blocking agents, or large doses of blood that contains citrate as an anticoagulant.potent diuretics not only cause ototoxicity themselves, but they can also increase the concentration of amikacin in the serum and tissue, making the ototoxicity even more likely. quinidine also increases levels of amikacin in the body. the nsaid indomethacin can increase serum aminoglycoside levels in premature infants. contrast mediums such as ioversol increases the nephrotoxicity and otoxicity caused by amikacin.amikacin can decrease the effect certain vaccines, such as the live bcg vaccine (used for tuberculosis), the cholera vaccine, and the live typhoid vaccine by acting as a pharmacological antagonist.


== pharmacology ==


=== mechanism of action ===

amikacin irreversibly binds to 16s rrna and the rna-binding s12 protein of the 30s subunit of prokaryotic ribosome and inhibits protein synthesis by changing the ribosome's shape so that it cannot read the mrna codons correctly.  it also interferes with the region that interacts with the wobble base of the trna anticodon. it works in a concentration-dependent manner, and has better action in an alkaline environment.at normal doses, amikacin-sensitive bacteria respond within 24–48 hours.


==== resistance ====
amikacin evades attacks by all antibiotic-inactivating enzymes that are responsible for antibiotic resistance in bacteria, except for aminoacetyltransferase and nucleotidyltransferase. this is accomplished by the l-hydroxyaminobuteroyl amide (l-haba) moiety attached to n-1 (compare to kanamycin, which simply has a hydrogen), which blocks the access and decreases the affinity of aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes. amikacin ends up with only one site where these enzymes can attack, while gentamicin and tobramycin have six.bacteria that are resistant to streptomycin and capreomycin are still susceptible to amikacin; bacteria that are resistant to kanamycin have varying susceptibility to amikacin. resistance to amikacin also confers resistance to kanamycin and capreomycin.resistance to amikacin and kanamycin in mycobacterium, the causative agent of tuberculosis, is due to a mutation in the rrs gene, which codes for the 16s rrna. mutations such as these reduce the binding affinity of amikacin to the bacteria's ribosome. variations of aminoglycoside acetyltransferase (aac) and aminoglycoside adenylyltransferase (aad) also confer resistance: resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa is caused by aac(6')-iv, which also confers resistance to kanamycin, gentamicin, and tobramycin, and resistance in staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis is caused by aad(4',4), which also confers resistance to kanamycin, tobramycin, and apramycin. some strains of s. aureus can also inactivate amikacin by phosphorylating it.


=== pharmacokinetics ===
amikacin is not absorbed orally and thus must be administered parenterally. it reaches peak serum concentrations in 0.5–2 hours when administered intramuscularly. less than 11% of the amikacin actually binds to plasma proteins. it is distributed into the heart, gallbladder, lungs, and bones, as well as in bile, sputum, interstitial fluid, pleural fluid, and synovial fluids. it is usually found at low concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid, except when administered intraventricularly. in infants, amikacin is normally found at 10–20% of plasma levels in the spinal fluid, but the amount reaches 50% in cases of meningitis. it does not easily cross the blood-brain barrier or enter ocular tissue.while the half-life of amikacin is normally two hours, it is 50 hours in those with end-stage renal disease.the vast majority (95%) of amikacin from an im or iv dose is secreted unchanged via glomerular filtration and into the urine within 24 hours. factors that cause amikacin to be excreted via urine include its relatively low molecular weight, high water solubility, and unmetabolized state.


== chemistry ==
amikacin is derived from kanamycin a:


== veterinary use ==
while amikacin is only fda-approved for use in dogs and for intrauterine infection in horses, it is one of the most common aminoglycosides used in veterinary medicine, and has been used in dogs, cats, guinea pigs, chinchillas, hamsters, rats, mice, prairie dogs, cattle, birds, snakes, turtles and tortoises, crocodilians, bullfrogs, and fish. it is often used for respiratory infections in snakes, bacterial shell disease in turtles, and sinusitis in macaws. it is generally contraindicated in rabbits and hares (though it has still been used) because it harms the balance of intestinal microflora.in dogs and cats, amikacin is commonly used as a topical antibiotic for ear infections and for corneal ulcers, especially those that are caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa. the ears are often cleaned before administering the medication, since pus and cellular debris lessen the activity of amikacin. amikacin is administered to the eye when prepared as an ophthalmic ointment or solution, or when injected subconjunctivally. amikacin in the eye can be accompanied by cephazolin. despite its use there amikacin (and all aminoglycosides) are toxic to intraocular structures.in horses, amikacin is fda-approved for uterine infections (such as endometriosis and pyometra) when caused by susceptible bacteria. it is also used in topical medication for the eyes and arthroscopic lavage; when combined with a cephalosporin, is used to treat subcutaneous infections that are caused by staphylococcus. for infections in the limbs or joints, it is often administered with a cephalosporin via limb perfusion directly into the limb or injected into the joint. amikacin is also injected into the joints with the anti-arthritic medication adequan in order to prevent infection.side effects in animals include nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and allergic reactions at im injection sites. cats tend to be more sensitive to the vestibular damage caused by ototoxicity. less frequent side effects include neuromuscular blockade, facial edema, and peripheral neuropathy.the half-life in most animals is one to two hours.treating overdoses of amikacin requires kidney dialysis or peritoneal dialysis, which reduce serum concentrations of amikacin, and/or penicillins, some of which can form complexes with amikacin that deactivate it.


== liposome inhalation suspension ==
amikacin liposome inhalation suspension was the first drug approved under the us limited population pathway for antibacterial and antifungal drugs (lpad pathway). it also was approved under the accelerated approval pathway. the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) granted the application for amikacin liposome inhalation suspension fast track, breakthrough therapy, priority review, and qualified infectious disease product (qidp) designations. the fda granted approval of arikayce to insmed, inc.the safety and efficacy of amikacin liposome inhalation suspension, an inhaled treatment taken through a nebulizer, was demonstrated in a randomized, controlled clinical trial where patients were assigned to one of two treatment groups. one group of patients received amikacin liposome inhalation suspension plus a background multi-drug antibacterial regimen, while the other treatment group received a background multi-drug antibacterial regimen alone. by the sixth month of treatment, 29 percent of patients treated with amikacin liposome inhalation suspension had no growth of mycobacteria in their sputum cultures for three consecutive months compared to 9 percent of patients who were not treated with amikacin liposome inhalation suspension.

fosmidomycin,antibiotic,"fosmidomycin is an antibiotic that was originally isolated from culture broths of bacteria of the genus streptomyces. it specifically inhibits dxp reductoisomerase, a key enzyme in the non-mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis. it is a structural analogue of 2-c-methyl-d-erythrose 4-phosphate. it inhibits the e. coli enzyme with a ki value of 38 nm (4), mtb at 80 nm, and the francisella enzyme at 99 nm. several mutations in the e. coli dxp reductoisomerase were found to confer resistance to fosmidomycin.


== use in malaria ==
the discovery of the non-mevalonate pathway in malaria parasites has indicated the use of fosmidomycin and other such inhibitors as antimalarial drugs. indeed, fosmidomycin has been tested in combination treatment with clindamycin for treatment of malaria with favorable results. it has been shown that an increase in copy number of the target enzyme (dxp reductoisomerase) correlates with in vitro fosmidomycin resistance in the lethal malaria parasite, plasmodium falciparum.

chloramphenicol,antibiotic,"chloramphenicol is an antibiotic useful for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections. this includes use as an eye ointment to treat conjunctivitis. by mouth or by injection into a vein, it is used to treat meningitis, plague, cholera, and typhoid fever. its use by mouth or by injection is only recommended when safer antibiotics cannot be used. monitoring both blood levels of the medication and blood cell levels every two days is recommended during treatment.common side effects include bone marrow suppression, nausea, and diarrhea. the bone marrow suppression may result in death. to reduce the risk of side effects treatment duration should be as short as possible. people with liver or kidney problems may need lower doses. in young children a condition known as gray baby syndrome may occur which results in a swollen stomach and low blood pressure. its use near the end of pregnancy and during breastfeeding is typically not recommended. chloramphenicol is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that typically stops bacterial growth by stopping the production of proteins.chloramphenicol was discovered after being isolated from streptomyces venezuelae in 1947. its chemical structure was identified and it was first synthesized in 1949. it is on the world health organization's list of essential medicines. it is available as a generic medication.


== medical uses ==
the original indication of chloramphenicol was in the treatment of typhoid, but the now almost universal presence of multiple drug-resistant salmonella typhi has meant it is seldom used for this indication except when the organism is known to be sensitive.
in low-income countries, the who no longer recommends only chloramphenicol as first-line to treat meningitis, but recognises it may be used with caution if there are no available alternatives.in the context of preventing endophthalmitis, a complication of cataract surgery, a 2017 systematic review found moderate evidence that using chloramphenicol eye drops in addition to an antibiotic injection (cefuroxime or penicillin) will likely lower the risk of endophthalmitis, compared to eye drops or antibiotic injections alone.


=== spectrum ===
chloramphenicol has a broad spectrum of activity and has been effective in treating ocular infections such as conjunctivitis, blepharitis etc. caused by a number of bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and escherichia coli. it is not effective against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the following susceptibility data represent the minimum inhibitory concentration for a few medically significant organisms.
escherichia coli:  0.015 – 10,000 μg/ml
staphylococcus aureus: 0.06 – 128 μg/ml
streptococcus pneumoniae: 2 – 16 μg/mleach of these concentrations is dependent upon the bacterial strain being targeted. some strains of e. coli, for example, show spontaneous emergence of chloramphenicol resistance.


=== resistance ===
three mechanisms of resistance to chloramphenicol are known: reduced membrane permeability, mutation of the 50s ribosomal subunit, and elaboration of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase.  it is easy to select for reduced membrane permeability to chloramphenicol in vitro by serial passage of bacteria, and this is the most common mechanism of low-level chloramphenicol resistance.  high-level resistance is conferred by the cat-gene; this gene codes for an enzyme called chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, which inactivates chloramphenicol by covalently linking one or two acetyl groups, derived from acetyl-s-coenzyme a, to the hydroxyl groups on the chloramphenicol molecule. the acetylation prevents chloramphenicol from binding to the ribosome.  resistance-conferring mutations of the 50s ribosomal subunit are rare.
chloramphenicol resistance may be carried on a plasmid that also codes for resistance to other drugs.  one example is the accot plasmid (a=ampicillin, c=chloramphenicol, co=co-trimoxazole, t=tetracycline), which mediates multiple drug resistance in typhoid (also called r factors).
as of 2014 some enterococcus faecium and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains are resistant to chloramphenicol. some veillonella spp. and staphylococcus capitis strains have also developed resistance to chloramphenicol to varying degrees.


== adverse effects ==


=== aplastic anemia ===
the most serious side effect of chloramphenicol treatment is aplastic anaemia. this effect is rare and sometimes fatal. the risk of aa is high enough that alternatives should be strongly considered. treatments are available but expensive. no way exists to predict who may or may not get this side effect.  the effect usually occurs weeks or months after treatment has been stopped, and a genetic predisposition may be involved.  it is not known whether monitoring the blood counts of patients can prevent the development of aplastic anaemia, but patients are recommended to have a baseline blood count with a repeat blood count every few days while on treatment. chloramphenicol should be discontinued if the complete blood count drops.  the highest risk is with oral chloramphenicol (affecting 1 in 24,000–40,000) and the lowest risk occurs with eye drops (affecting less than one in 224,716 prescriptions).thiamphenicol, a related compound with a similar spectrum of activity, is available in italy and china for human use, and has never been associated with aplastic anaemia. thiamphenicol is available in the u.s. and europe as a veterinary antibiotic, but is not approved for use in humans.


=== bone marrow suppression ===
chloramphenicol may cause bone marrow suppression during treatment; this is a direct toxic effect of the drug on human mitochondria. this effect manifests first as a fall in hemoglobin levels, which occurs quite predictably once a cumulative dose of 20 g has been given. the anaemia is fully reversible once the drug is stopped and does not predict future development of aplastic anaemia. studies in mice have suggested existing marrow damage may compound any marrow damage resulting from the toxic effects of chloramphenicol.


=== leukemia ===
leukemia, a cancer of the blood or bone marrow, is characterized by an abnormal increase of immature white blood cells. the risk of childhood leukemia is increased, as demonstrated in a chinese case–control study, and the risk increases with length of treatment.


=== gray baby syndrome ===
intravenous chloramphenicol use has been associated with the so-called gray baby syndrome.
this phenomenon occurs in newborn infants because they do not yet have fully functional liver enzymes (i.e. udp-glucuronyl transferase), so chloramphenicol remains unmetabolized in the body.
this causes several adverse effects, including hypotension and cyanosis. the condition can be prevented by using the drug at the recommended doses, and monitoring blood levels.


=== hypersensitivity reactions ===
fever, macular and vesicular rashes, angioedema, urticaria, and anaphylaxis may occur. herxheimer's reactions have occurred during therapy for typhoid fever.


=== neurotoxic reactions ===
headache, mild depression, mental confusion, and delirium have been described in patients receiving chloramphenicol. optic and peripheral neuritis have been reported, usually following long-term therapy. if this occurs, the drug should be promptly withdrawn.


== pharmacokinetics ==
chloramphenicol is extremely lipid-soluble; it remains relatively unbound to protein and is a small molecule. it has a large apparent volume of distribution and penetrates effectively into all tissues of the body, including the brain.  distribution is not uniform, with highest concentrations found in the liver and kidney, with lowest in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid.  the concentration achieved in brain and cerebrospinal fluid  is around 30 to 50% of the overall average body concentration, even when the meninges are not inflamed; this increases to as high as 89% when the meninges are inflamed.
chloramphenicol increases the absorption of iron.


=== use in special populations ===
chloramphenicol is metabolized by the liver to chloramphenicol glucuronate (which is inactive).  in liver impairment, the dose of chloramphenicol must therefore be reduced. no standard dose reduction exists for chloramphenicol in liver impairment, and the dose should be adjusted according to measured plasma concentrations.
the majority of the chloramphenicol dose is excreted by the kidneys as the inactive metabolite, chloramphenicol glucuronate.  only a tiny fraction of the chloramphenicol is excreted by the kidneys unchanged.  plasma levels should be monitored in patients with renal impairment, but this is not mandatory.  chloramphenicol succinate ester (an intravenous prodrug form) is readily excreted unchanged by the kidneys, more so than chloramphenicol base, and this is the major reason why levels of chloramphenicol in the blood are much lower when given intravenously than orally.chloramphenicol passes into breast milk, so should therefore be avoided during breast feeding, if possible.


=== dose monitoring ===
plasma levels of chloramphenicol must be monitored in neonates and patients with abnormal liver function.  plasma levels should be monitored in all children under the age of four, the elderly, and patients with kidney failure.
because efficacy and toxicity of chloramphenicol are associated with a maximum serum concentration, peak levels (one hour after the intravenous dose is given) should be 10–20 µg/ml with toxicity > 40 µg/ml; trough levels (taken immediately before a dose) should be 5–10 µg/ml.


=== drug interactions ===
administration of chloramphenicol concomitantly with bone marrow depressant drugs is contraindicated, although concerns over aplastic anaemia associated with ocular chloramphenicol have largely been discounted.chloramphenicol is a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome p450 isoforms cyp2c19 and cyp3a4 in the liver. inhibition of cyp2c19 causes decreased metabolism and therefore increased levels of, for example, antidepressants, antiepileptics, proton-pump inhibitors, and anticoagulants if they are given concomitantly. inhibition of cyp3a4 causes increased levels of, for example, calcium channel blockers, immunosuppressants, chemotherapeutic drugs, benzodiazepines, azole antifungals, tricyclic antidepressants, macrolide antibiotics, ssris, statins, cardiac antiarrhythmics, antivirals, anticoagulants, and pde5 inhibitors.


=== drug antagonistic ===
chloramphenicol is antagonistic with most cephalosporins and using both together should be avoided in the treatment of infections.


== mechanism of action ==
chloramphenicol is a bacteriostatic by inhibiting protein synthesis.  it prevents protein chain elongation by inhibiting the peptidyl transferase activity of the bacterial ribosome. it specifically binds to a2451 and a2452 residues in the 23s rrna of the 50s ribosomal subunit, preventing peptide bond formation. chloramphenicol directly interferes with substrate binding in the ribosome, as compared to macrolides, which sterically block the progression of the growing peptide.


== history ==
chloramphenicol was first isolated from streptomyces venezuelae in 1947 and in 1949 a team of scientists at parke-davis including mildred rebstock published their identification of the chemical structure and their synthesis, making it the first antibiotic to be made instead of extracted from a microorganism.in 2007, the accumulation of reports associating aplastic anemia and blood dyscrasia with chloramphenicol eye drops lead to the classification of “probable human carcinogen” according to world health organization criteria, based on the known published case reports and the spontaneous reports submitted to the national registry of drug-induced ocular side effects.


== society and culture ==


=== names ===
chloramphenicol is available as a generic worldwide under many brandnames and also under various generic names in eastern europe and russia, including chlornitromycin, levomycetin, and chloromycetin; the racemate is known as synthomycetin.


=== formulations ===

chloramphenicol is available as a capsule or as a liquid. in some countries, it is sold as chloramphenicol palmitate ester (cpe). cpe is inactive, and is hydrolysed to active chloramphenicol in the small intestine. no difference in bioavailability is noted between chloramphenicol and cpe.
manufacture of oral chloramphenicol in the u.s. stopped in 1991, because the vast majority of chloramphenicol-associated cases of aplastic anaemia are associated with the oral preparation. no oral formulation of chloramphenicol is now available in the u.s.
in molecular biology, chloramphenicol is prepared in ethanol.


==== intravenous ====
the intravenous (iv) preparation of chloramphenicol is the succinate ester.  this creates a problem: chloramphenicol succinate ester is an inactive prodrug and must first be hydrolysed to chloramphenicol; however, the hydrolysis process is often incomplete, and 30% of the dose is lost and removed in the urine.  serum concentrations of iv chloramphenicol are only 70% of those achieved when chloramphenicol is given orally.  for this reason, the dose needs to be increased to 75 mg/kg/day when administered iv to achieve levels equivalent to the oral dose.


==== oily ====
oily chloramphenicol (or chloramphenicol oil suspension) is a long-acting preparation of chloramphenicol first introduced by roussel in 1954; marketed as tifomycine, it was originally used as a treatment for typhoid.  roussel stopped production of oily chloramphenicol in 1995; the international dispensary association has manufactured it since 1998, first in malta and then in india from december 2004.oily chloramphenicol was first used to treat meningitis in 1975 and numerous studies since have demonstrated its efficacy.  it is the cheapest treatment available for meningitis (us$5 per treatment course, compared to us$30 for ampicillin and us$15 for five days of ceftriaxone).  it has the great advantage of requiring only a single injection, whereas ceftriaxone is traditionally given daily for five days.  this recommendation may yet change, now that a single dose of ceftriaxone (cost us$3) has been shown to be equivalent to one dose of oily chloramphenicol.


==== eye drops ====
chloramphenicol is still used occasionally in topical preparations (ointments and eye drops) for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis. isolated case reports of aplastic anaemia following use of chloramphenicol eyedrops exist, but the risk is estimated to be of the order of less than one in 224,716 prescriptions. in mexico, this is the treatment used prophylactically in newborns.


== veterinary uses ==
although its use in veterinary medicine is highly restricted, chloramphenicol still has some important veterinary uses. it is currently considered the most useful treatment of chlamydial disease in koalas. the pharmacokinetics of chloramphenicol have been investigated in koalas.although unpublished, recent research suggests chloramphenicol could also be applied to frogs to prevent their widespread destruction from fungal infections.  it has recently been discovered to be a life-saving cure for chytridiomycosis in amphibians. chytridiomycosis is a fungal disease, blamed for the extinction of one-third of the 120 frog species lost since 1980.

bupivacaine injection,drug,"bupivacaine, marketed under the brand name marcaine among others, is a medication used to decrease feeling in a specific area. in nerve blocks, it is injected around a nerve that supplies the area, or into the spinal canal's epidural space. it is available mixed with a small amount of epinephrine to increase the duration of its action. it typically begins working within 15 minutes and lasts for 2 to 8 hours.possible side effects include sleepiness, muscle twitching, ringing in the ears, changes in vision, low blood pressure, and an irregular heart rate. concerns exist that injecting it into a joint can cause problems with the cartilage. concentrated bupivacaine is not recommended for epidural freezing. epidural freezing may also increase the length of labor. it is a local anaesthetic of the amide group.bupivacaine was discovered in 1957. it is on the world health organization's list of essential medicines. bupivacaine is available as a generic medication. an implantable formulation of bupivacaine (xaracoll) was approved for medical use in the united states in august 2020.


== medical uses ==
bupivacaine is indicated for local infiltration, peripheral nerve block, sympathetic nerve block, and epidural and caudal blocks.  it is sometimes used in combination with epinephrine to prevent systemic absorption and extend the duration of action.  the 0.75% (most concentrated) formulation is used in retrobulbar block.   it is the most commonly used local anesthetic in epidural anesthesia during labor, as well as in postoperative pain management. liposomal formulations of bupivacaine (brand name exparel) have shown to be more effective in providing pain relief than plain solutions of bupivacaine.the fixed-dose combination of bupivacaine with type i collagen (brand name xaracoll) is indicated for acute postsurgical analgesia (pain relief) for up to 24 hours in adults following open inguinal hernia repair.bupivacaine (posimir) is indicated in adults for administration into the subacromial space under direct arthroscopic visualization to produce post-surgical analgesia for up to 72 hours following arthroscopic subacromial decompression.


== contraindications ==
bupivacaine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity reactions to bupivacaine or amino-amide anesthetics.  it is also contraindicated in obstetrical paracervical blocks and intravenous regional anaesthesia (bier block) because of potential risk of tourniquet failure and systemic absorption of the drug and subsequent cardiac arrest.  the 0.75% formulation is contraindicated in epidural anesthesia during labor because of the association with refractory cardiac arrest.


== adverse effects ==
compared to other local anaesthetics, bupivacaine is markedly cardiotoxic. however, adverse drug reactions (adrs) are rare when it is administered correctly. most adrs are caused by accelerated absorption from the injection site, unintentional intravascular injection, or slow metabolic degradation.  however, allergic reactions can rarely occur.clinically significant adverse events result from systemic absorption of bupivacaine and primarily involve the central nervous system (cns) and cardiovascular system.  cns effects typically occur at lower blood plasma concentrations.  initially, cortical inhibitory pathways are selectively inhibited, causing symptoms of neuronal excitation.  at higher plasma concentrations, both inhibitory and excitatory pathways are inhibited, causing cns depression and potentially coma.  higher plasma concentrations also lead to cardiovascular effects, though cardiovascular collapse may also occur with low concentrations.  adverse cns effects may indicate impending cardiotoxicity and should be carefully monitored.
cns: circumoral numbness, facial tingling, vertigo, tinnitus, restlessness, anxiety, dizziness, seizure, coma
cardiovascular: hypotension, arrhythmia, bradycardia, heart block, cardiac arresttoxicity can also occur in the setting of subarachnoid injection during high spinal anesthesia.  these effects include: paresthesia, paralysis, apnea, hypoventilation, fecal incontinence, and urinary incontinence.  additionally, bupivacaine can cause chondrolysis after continuous infusion into a joint space.bupivacaine has caused several deaths when the epidural anaesthetic has been administered intravenously accidentally.


=== treatment of overdose ===

animal evidence indicates intralipid, a commonly available intravenous lipid emulsion, can be effective in treating severe cardiotoxicity secondary to local anaesthetic overdose, and human case reports of successful use in this way. plans to publicize this treatment more widely have been published.


=== pregnancy and lactation ===
bupivacaine crosses the placenta and is a pregnancy category c drug.  however, it is approved for use at term in obstetrical anesthesia.  bupivacaine is excreted in breast milk.  risks of discontinuing breast feeding versus discontinuing bupivacaine should be discussed with the patient.


=== postarthroscopic glenohumeral chondrolysis ===
bupivacaine is toxic to cartilage and its intra-articular infusions may lead to postarthroscopic glenohumeral chondrolysis.


== pharmacology ==


=== pharmacodynamics ===
bupivacaine binds to the intracellular portion of voltage-gated sodium channels and blocks sodium influx into nerve cells, which prevents depolarization.  without depolarization, no initiation or conduction of a pain signal can occur.


=== pharmacokinetics ===
the rate of systemic absorption of bupivacaine and other local anesthetics is dependent upon the dose and concentration of drug administered, the route of administration, the vascularity of the administration site, and the presence or absence of epinephrine in the preparation.
onset of action (route and dose-dependent): 1-17 min
duration of action (route and dose-dependent): 2-9 hr
half life: neonates, 8.1 hr, adults: 2.7 hr
time to peak plasma concentration (for peripheral, epidural, or caudal block): 30-45 min
protein binding: about 95%
metabolism: hepatic
excretion: renal (6% unchanged)


== chemical structure ==
like lidocaine, bupivacaine is an amino-amide anesthetic; the aromatic head and the hydrocarbon chain are linked by an amide bond rather than an ester as in earlier local anesthetics.  as a result, the amino-amide anesthetics are more stable and less likely to cause allergic reactions.  unlike lidocaine, the terminal amino portion of bupivacaine (as well as mepivacaine, ropivacaine, and levobupivacaine) is contained within a piperidine ring; these agents are known as pipecholyl xylidines.


== society and culture ==


=== legal status ===
on 17 september 2020, the committee for medicinal products for human use (chmp) of the european medicines agency (ema) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product exparel, intended for the treatment of post-operative pain. the applicant for this medicinal product is pacira ireland limited. exparel liposomal was approved for medical use in the european union in november 2020.


=== economics ===
bupivacaine is available as a generic medication.


== research ==
levobupivacaine is the (s)-(–)-enantiomer of bupivacaine, with a longer duration of action, producing less vasodilation.  durect corporation is developing a biodegradable, controlled-release drug delivery system for after surgery.  it has currently completed a phase-iii clinical trial.

cardiac mesenchymal cell,cell,"stem-cell therapy is the use of stem cells to treat or prevent a disease or condition. as of 2016, the only established therapy using stem cells is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. this usually takes the form of a bone-marrow transplantation, but the cells can also be derived from umbilical cord blood. research is underway to develop various sources for stem cells as well as to apply stem-cell treatments for neurodegenerative diseases and conditions such as diabetes and heart disease.
stem-cell therapy has become controversial following developments such as the ability of scientists to isolate and culture embryonic stem cells, to create stem cells using somatic cell nuclear transfer and their use of techniques to create induced pluripotent stem cells. this controversy is often related to abortion politics and to human cloning. additionally, efforts to market treatments based on transplant of stored umbilical cord blood have been controversial.


== medical uses ==

for over 30 years, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (hsct) has been used to treat people with conditions such as leukaemia and lymphoma; this is the only widely practiced form of stem-cell therapy. during chemotherapy, most growing cells are killed by the cytotoxic agents. these agents, however, cannot discriminate between the leukaemia or neoplastic cells, and the hematopoietic stem cells within the bone marrow. this is the side effect of conventional chemotherapy strategies that the stem-cell transplant attempts to reverse; a donor's healthy bone marrow reintroduces functional stem cells to replace the cells lost in the host's body during treatment. the transplanted cells also generate an immune response that helps to kill off the cancer cells; this process can go too far, however, leading to graft vs host disease, the most serious side effect of this treatment.another stem-cell therapy, called prochymal, was conditionally approved in canada in 2012 for the management of acute graft-vs-host disease in children who are unresponsive to steroids. it is an allogenic stem therapy based on mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) derived from the bone marrow of adult donors. mscs are purified from the marrow, cultured and packaged, with up to 10,000 doses derived from a single donor. the doses are stored frozen until needed.the fda has approved five hematopoietic stem-cell products derived from umbilical-cord blood, for the treatment of blood and immunological diseases.in 2014, the european medicines agency recommended approval of limbal stem cells for people with severe limbal stem cell deficiency due to burns in the eye.


== research ==

stem cells are being studied for a number of reasons. the molecules and exosomes released from stem cells are also being studied in an effort to make medications. in addition to the functions of the cells themselves, paracrine soluble factors produced by stem cells, known as the stem cell secretome, have been found to be another mechanism by which stem cell-based therapies mediate their effects in degenerative, autoimmune, and inflammatory diseases.


=== stem cell expansion ===
to be used for research or treatment applications, large numbers of high-quality stem cells are needed. it is a necessary requirement to develop a culture system to produce pure populations of tissue-specific stem-cells in vitro without the loss of stem-cell potential. two main approaches are taken for this purpose - two-dimensional and three-dimensional cell culture.cell culture in two dimensions has been routinely performed in thousands of laboratories worldwide for the past four decades. in two-dimensional platforms, cells are typically exposed to a solid, rigid flat surface on the basal side and to liquid at the apical
surface. inhabiting such a two-dimensional rigid substrate requires a dramatic adaption for the surviving cells because they lack the extracellular matrix that is unique to each cell type, and which may alter cell metabolism and reduce its functionality.three-dimensional cell culture systems may create a biomimicking microenvironment for stem cells, resembling their native three-dimensional extracellular matrix (ecm). advanced biomaterials have significantly contributed to three-dimensional cell culture systems in recent decades, and more unique and complex biomaterials have been proposed for improving stem-cell proliferation and controlled differentiation. among them, nanostructured biomaterials are of particular interest because they have the advantage of a high surface-to-volume ratio, and they mimic the physical and biological features of natural ecm at the nanoscale.


=== applications ===


==== neurodegeneration ====
research has been conducted on the effects of stem cells on animal models of brain degeneration, such as in parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and alzheimer's disease. preliminary studies related to multiple sclerosis have been conducted.healthy adult brains contain neural stem cells, which divide to maintain general stem-cell numbers, or become progenitor cells. in healthy adult laboratory animals, progenitor cells migrate within the brain and function primarily to maintain neuron populations for olfaction (the sense of smell). pharmacological activation of endogenous neural stem cells has been reported to induce neuroprotection and behavioral recovery in adult rat models of neurological disorder.


==== brain and spinal cord injury ====
stroke and traumatic brain injury lead to cell death, characterized by a loss of neurons and oligodendrocytes within the brain. clinical and animal studies have been conducted into the use of stem cells in cases of spinal cord injury.


==== frailty syndrome ====
a small-scale study on individuals 60 year or older with aging frailty showed, after intravenous treatment with mscs from healthy young donors, showed significant improvements in physical performance measures.


==== heart ====
stem cells are studied in people with severe heart disease. the work by bodo-eckehard strauer was discredited by identifying hundreds of factual contradictions. among several clinical trials reporting that adult stem cell therapy is safe and effective, actual evidence of benefit has been reported from only a few studies. some preliminary clinical trials achieved only modest improvements in heart function following use of bone marrow stem cell therapy.stem-cell therapy for treatment of myocardial infarction usually makes use of autologous bone-marrow stem cells, but other types of adult stem cells may be used, such as adipose-derived stem cells.possible mechanisms of recovery include:
generation of heart muscle cells
stimulating growth of new blood vessels to repopulate damaged heart tissue
secretion of growth factors


===== criticisms =====
in 2013, studies of autologous bone-marrow stem cells on ventricular function were found to contain ""hundreds"" of discrepancies. critics report that of 48 reports, just five underlying trials seemed to be used, and that in many cases whether they were randomized or merely observational accepter-versus-rejecter, was contradictory between reports of the same trial. one pair of reports of identical baseline characteristics and final results, was presented in two publications as, respectively, a 578-patient randomized trial and as a 391-subject observational study. other reports required (impossible) negative standard deviations in subsets of people, or contained fractional subjects, negative nyha classes. overall, many more people were reported as having receiving stem cells in trials, than the number of stem cells processed in the hospital's laboratory during that time. a university investigation, closed in 2012 without reporting, was reopened in july 2013.in 2014, a meta-analysis on stem cell therapy using bone-marrow stem cells for heart disease revealed discrepancies in published clinical trial reports, whereby studies with a higher number of discrepancies showed an increase in effect sizes. another meta-analysis based on the intra-subject data of 12 randomized trials was unable to find any significant benefits of stem cell therapy on primary endpoints, such as major adverse events or increase in heart function measures, concluding there was no benefit.the time trial, which used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial design, concluded that ""bone marrow mononuclear cells administration did not improve recovery of lv function over 2 years"" in people who had a myocardial infarction. accordingly, the boost-2 trial conducted in 10 medical centers in germany and norway reported that the trial result ""does not support the use of nucleated bmcs in patients with stemi and moderately reduced lvef"". furthermore, the trial also did not meet any other secondary mri endpoints, leading to a conclusion that intracoronary bone marrow stem cell therapy does not offer a functional or clinical benefit.


==== blood-cell formation ====
the specificity of the human immune-cell repertoire is what allows the human body to defend itself from rapidly adapting antigens. however, the immune system is vulnerable to degradation upon the pathogenesis of disease, and because of the critical role that it plays in overall defense, its degradation is often fatal to the organism as a whole. diseases of hematopoietic cells are diagnosed and classified via a subspecialty of pathology known as hematopathology. the specificity of the immune cells is what allows recognition of foreign antigens, causing further challenges in the treatment of immune disease. identical matches between donor and recipient must be made for successful transplantation treatments, but matches are uncommon, even between first-degree relatives. research using both hematopoietic adult stem cells and embryonic stem cells has provided insight into the possible mechanisms and methods of treatment for many of these ailments.fully mature human red blood cells may be generated ex vivo by hematopoietic stem cells (hscs), which are precursors of red blood cells. in this process, hscs are grown together with stromal cells, creating an environment that mimics the conditions of bone marrow, the natural site of red-blood-cell growth. erythropoietin, a growth factor, is added, coaxing the stem cells to complete terminal differentiation into red blood cells. further research into this technique should have potential benefits to gene therapy, blood transfusion, and topical medicine.


==== regrowing teeth ====
in 2004, scientists at king's college london discovered a way to cultivate a complete tooth in mice and were able to grow bioengineered teeth stand-alone in the laboratory. researchers are confident that the tooth regeneration technology can be used to grow live teeth in people.	
in theory, stem cells taken from the patient could be coaxed in the lab turning into a tooth bud which, when implanted in the gums, will give rise to a new tooth, and would be expected to be grown in a time over three weeks. it will fuse with the jawbone and release chemicals that encourage nerves and blood vessels to connect with it. the process is similar to what happens when humans grow their original adult teeth. many challenges remain, however, before stem cells could be a choice for the replacement of missing teeth in the future.


==== cochlear hair cell regrowth ====
heller has reported success in re-growing cochlea hair cells with the use of embryonic stem cells.in a 2019 review that looked at hearing regeneration and regenerative medicine, stem cell-derived otic progenitors have the potential to greatly improve hearing.


==== blindness and vision impairment ====
since 2003, researchers have successfully transplanted corneal stem cells into damaged eyes to restore vision. ""sheets of retinal cells used by the team are harvested from aborted fetuses, which some people find objectionable."" when these sheets are transplanted over the damaged cornea, the stem cells stimulate renewed repair, eventually restore vision. the latest such development was in june 2005, when researchers at the queen victoria hospital of sussex, england were able to restore the sight of forty people using the same technique. the group, led by sheraz daya, was able to successfully use adult stem cells obtained from the patient, a relative, or even a cadaver. further rounds of trials are ongoing.


==== pancreatic beta cells ====
people with type 1 diabetes lose the function of insulin-producing beta cells within the pancreas. in recent experiments, scientists have been able to coax embryonic stem cell to turn into beta cells in the lab. in theory if the beta cell is transplanted successfully, they will be able to replace malfunctioning ones in a diabetic patient.


==== orthopedics ====
use of mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) derived from adult stem cells is under preliminary research for potential orthopedic applications in bone and muscle trauma, cartilage repair, osteoarthritis, intervertebral disc surgery, rotator cuff surgery, and musculoskeletal disorders, among others. other areas of orthopedic research for uses of mscs include tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.


==== wound healing ====
stem cells can also be used to stimulate the growth of human tissues. in an adult, wounded tissue is most often replaced by scar tissue, which is characterized in the skin by disorganized collagen structure, loss of hair follicles and irregular vascular structure. in the case of wounded fetal tissue, however, wounded tissue is replaced with normal tissue through the activity of stem cells. a possible method for tissue regeneration in adults is to place adult stem cell ""seeds"" inside a tissue bed ""soil"" in a wound bed and allow the stem cells to stimulate differentiation in the tissue bed cells. this method elicits a regenerative response more similar to fetal wound-healing than adult scar tissue formation. researchers are still investigating different aspects of the ""soil"" tissue that are conducive to regeneration. because of the general healing capabilities of stem cells, they have gained interest for the treatment of cutaneous wounds, such as in skin cancer.


==== infertility ====
culture of human embryonic stem cells in mitotically inactivated porcine ovarian fibroblasts (pof) causes differentiation into germ cells (precursor cells of oocytes and spermatozoa), as evidenced by gene expression analysis.human embryonic stem cells have been stimulated to form spermatozoon-like cells, yet still slightly damaged or malformed. it could potentially treat azoospermia.
in 2012, oogonial stem cells were isolated from adult mouse and human ovaries and demonstrated to be capable of forming mature oocytes. these cells have the potential to treat infertility.


==== hiv/aids ====
destruction of the immune system by the hiv is driven by the loss of cd4+ t cells in the peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues. viral entry into cd4+ cells is mediated by the interaction with a cellular chemokine receptor, the most common of which are ccr5 and cxcr4. because subsequent viral replication requires cellular gene expression processes, activated cd4+ cells are the primary targets of productive hiv infection. recently scientists have been investigating an alternative approach to treating hiv-1/aids, based on the creation of a disease-resistant immune system through transplantation of autologous, gene-modified (hiv-1-resistant) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (gm-hspc).


==== clinical trials ====


=== regenerative treatment models ===
stem cells are thought to mediate repair via five primary mechanisms: 1) providing an anti-inflammatory effect, 2) homing to damaged tissues and recruiting other cells, such as endothelial progenitor cells, that are necessary for tissue growth, 3) supporting tissue remodeling over scar formation, 4) inhibiting apoptosis, and 5) differentiating into bone, cartilage, tendon, and ligament tissue.to further enrich blood supply to the damaged areas, and consequently promote tissue regeneration, platelet-rich plasma could be used in conjunction with stem cell transplantation. the efficacy of some stem cell populations may also be affected by the method of delivery; for instance, to regenerate bone, stem cells are often introduced in a scaffold where they produce the minerals necessary for generation of functional bone.stem cells have also been shown to have a low immunogenicity due to the relatively low number of mhc molecules found on their surface. in addition, they have been found to secrete chemokines that alter the immune response and promote tolerance of the new tissue. this allows for allogeneic treatments to be performed without a high rejection risk.


=== drug discovery and biomedical research ===
the ability to grow up functional adult tissues indefinitely in culture through directed differentiation creates new opportunities for drug research. researchers are able to grow up differentiated cell lines and then test new drugs on each cell type to examine possible interactions in vitro before performing in vivo studies. this is critical in the development of drugs for use in veterinary research because of the possibilities of species-specific interactions. the hope is that having these cell lines available for research use will reduce the need for research animals used because effects on human tissue in vitro will provide insight not normally known before the animal testing phase.
with the advent of induced pluripotent stem cells (ipsc), treatments being explored and created for the used in endangered low production animals possible. rather than needing to harvest embryos or eggs, which are limited, the researchers can remove mesenchymal stem cells with greater ease and greatly reducing the danger to the animal due to noninvasive techniques. this allows the limited eggs to be put to use for reproductive purposes only.


=== conservation ===
stem cells are being explored for use in conservation efforts. spermatogonial stem cells have been harvested from a rat and placed into a mouse host and fully mature sperm were produced with the ability to produce viable offspring. currently research is underway to find suitable hosts for the introduction of donor spermatogonial stem cells. if this becomes a viable option for conservationists, sperm can be produced from high genetic quality individuals who die before reaching sexual maturity, preserving a line that would otherwise be lost.


=== sources for stem cells ===
most stem cells intended for regenerative therapy are generally isolated either from the patient's bone marrow or from adipose tissue. mesenchymal stem cells can differentiate into the cells that make up bone, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments, as well as muscle, neural and other progenitor tissues. they have been the main type of stem cells studied in the treatment of diseases affecting these tissues. the number of stem cells transplanted into damaged tissue may alter the efficacy of treatment. accordingly, stem cells derived from bone marrow aspirates, for instance, are cultured in specialized laboratories for expansion to millions of cells. although adipose-derived tissue also requires processing prior to use, the culturing methodology for adipose-derived stem cells is not as extensive as that for bone marrow-derived cells. while it is thought that bone-marrow-derived stem cells are preferred for bone, cartilage, ligament, and tendon repair, others believe that the less challenging collection techniques and the multi-cellular microenvironment already present in adipose-derived stem cell fractions make the latter the preferred source for autologous transplantation.new sources of mesenchymal stem cells are being researched, including stem cells present in the skin and dermis which are of interest because of the ease at which they can be harvested with minimal risk to the animal. hematopoietic stem cells have also been discovered to be travelling in the blood stream and possess equal differentiating ability as other mesenchymal stem cells, again with a very non-invasive harvesting technique.there has been more recent interest in the use of extra embryonic mesenchymal stem cells. research is underway to examine the differentiating capabilities of stem cells found in the umbilical cord, yolk sac and placenta of different animals. these stem cells are thought to have more differentiating ability than their adult counterparts, including the ability to more readily form tissues of endodermal and ectodermal origin.


==== embryonic stem cell lines ====

there is widespread controversy over the use of human embryonic stem cells. this controversy primarily targets the techniques used to derive new embryonic stem cell lines, which often requires the destruction of the blastocyst. opposition to the use of human embryonic stem cells in research is often based on philosophical, moral, or religious objections. there is other stem cell research that does not involve the destruction of a human embryo, and such research involves adult stem cells, amniotic stem cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells.
on 23 january 2009, the us food and drug administration gave clearance to geron corporation for the initiation of the first clinical trial of an embryonic stem-cell-based therapy on humans. the trial aimed to evaluate the drug grnopc1, embryonic stem cell-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, on people with acute spinal cord injury. the trial was discontinued in november 2011 so that the company could focus on therapies in the ""current environment of capital scarcity and uncertain economic conditions"". in 2013 biotechnology and regenerative medicine company biotime (amex: btx) acquired geron's stem cell assets in a stock transaction, with the aim of restarting the clinical trial.


==== mesenchymal stromal cells (mscs) ====
scientists have reported that mscs when transfused immediately within few hours post thawing may show reduced function or show decreased efficacy in treating diseases as compared to those mscs which are in log phase of cell growth (fresh), so cryopreserved mscs should be brought back into log phase of cell growth in invitro culture before administration. re-culturing of mscs will help in recovering from the shock the cells get during freezing and thawing. various msc clinical trials which used cryopreserved product immediately post thaw,  have failed as compared to those clinical trials which used fresh mscs.


== veterinary medicine ==
research has been conducted on horses, dogs, and cats can benefit the development of stem cell treatments in veterinary medicine and can target a wide range of injuries and diseases such as myocardial infarction, stroke, tendon and ligament damage, osteoarthritis, osteochondrosis and muscular dystrophy both in large animals, as well as humans. while investigation of cell-based therapeutics generally reflects human medical needs, the high degree of frequency and severity of certain injuries in racehorses has put veterinary medicine at the forefront of this novel regenerative approach. companion animals can serve as clinically relevant models that closely mimic human disease.


=== sources of stem cells ===
veterinary applications of stem cell therapy as a means of tissue regeneration have been largely shaped by research that began with the use of adult-derived mesenchymal stem cells to treat animals with injuries or defects affecting bone, cartilage, ligaments and/or tendons. there are two main categories of stem cells used for treatments: allogeneic stem cells derived from a genetically different donor within the same species and autologous mesenchymal stem cells, derived from the patient prior to use in various treatments. a third category, xenogenic stem cells, or stem cells derived from different species, are used primarily for research purposes, especially for human treatments.


=== bone repair ===
bone has a unique and well documented natural healing process that normally is sufficient to repair fractures and other common injuries. misaligned breaks due to severe trauma, as well as treatments like tumor resections of bone cancer, are prone to improper healing if left to the natural process alone. scaffolds composed of natural and artificial components are seeded with mesenchymal stem cells and placed in the defect. within four weeks of placing the scaffold, newly formed bone begins to integrate with the old bone and within 32 weeks, full union is achieved. further studies are necessary to fully characterize the use of cell-based therapeutics for treatment of bone fractures.
stem cells have been used to treat degenerative bone diseases. the normally recommended treatment for dogs that have legg–calve–perthes disease is to remove the head of the femur after the degeneration has progressed. recently, mesenchymal stem cells have been injected directly in to the head of the femur, with success not only in bone regeneration, but also in pain reduction.


=== ligament and tendon repair ===
autologous stem cell-based treatments for ligament injury, tendon injury, osteoarthritis, osteochondrosis, and sub-chondral bone cysts have been commercially available to practicing veterinarians to treat horses since 2003 in the united states and since 2006 in the united kingdom. autologous stem cell based treatments for tendon injury, ligament injury, and osteoarthritis in dogs have been available to veterinarians in the united states since 2005. over 3000 privately owned horses and dogs have been treated with autologous adipose-derived stem cells. the efficacy of these treatments has been shown in double-blind clinical trials for dogs with osteoarthritis of the hip and elbow and horses with tendon damage.race horses are especially prone to injuries of the tendon and ligaments. conventional therapies are very unsuccessful in returning the horse to full functioning potential. natural healing, guided by the conventional treatments, leads to the formation of fibrous scar tissue that reduces flexibility and full joint movement. traditional treatments prevented a large number of horses from returning to full activity and also have a high incidence of re-injury due to the stiff nature of the scarred tendon. introduction of both bone marrow and adipose derived stem cells, along with natural mechanical stimulus promoted the regeneration of tendon tissue. the natural movement promoted the alignment of the new fibers and tendocytes with the natural alignment found in uninjured tendons. stem cell treatment not only allowed more horses to return to full duty and also greatly reduced the re-injury rate over a three-year period.the use of embryonic stem cells has also been applied to tendon repair. the embryonic stem cells were shown to have a better survival rate in the tendon as well as better migrating capabilities to reach all areas of damaged tendon. the overall repair quality was also higher, with better tendon architecture and collagen formed. there was also no tumor formation seen during the three-month experimental period. long-term studies need to be carried out to examine the long-term efficacy and risks associated with the use of embryonic stem cells. similar results have been found in small animals.


==== joint repair ====
osteoarthritis is the main cause of joint pain both in animals and humans. horses and dogs are most frequently affected by arthritis. natural cartilage regeneration is very limited. different types of mesenchymal stem cells and other additives are still being researched to find the best type of cell and method for long-term treatment.adipose-derived mesenchymal cells are currently the most often used for stem cell treatment of osteoarthritis because of the non-invasive harvesting. this is a recently developed, non-invasive technique developed for easier clinical use. dogs receiving this treatment showed greater flexibility in their joints and less pain.


=== muscle repairs ===
stem cells have successfully been used to ameliorate healing in the heart after myocardial infarction in dogs. adipose and bone marrow derived stem cells were removed and induced to a cardiac cell fate before being injected into the heart. the heart was found to have improved contractility and a reduction in the damaged area four weeks after the stem cells were applied.a different trial is underway for a patch made of a porous substance onto which the stem cells are ""seeded"" in order to induce tissue regeneration in heart defects. tissue was regenerated and the patch was well incorporated into the heart tissue. this is thought to be due, in part, to improved angiogenesis and reduction of inflammation. although cardiomyocytes were produced from the mesenchymal stem cells, they did not appear to be contractile. other treatments that induced a cardiac fate in the cells before transplanting had greater success at creating contractile heart tissue.recent research, such as the european ntrack resarch project, aims to demonstrate that multimodal nanoparticles can structurally and functionally track stem cell in muscle regeneration therapy. the idea is to label stem cells with gold nano-particles that are fully characterised for uptake, functionality, and safety. the labelled stem cells will be injected into an injured muscle and tracked using imaging systems. however, the system still needs to be demonstrated at lab scale.


==== nervous system repairs ====
spinal cord injuries are one of the most common traumas brought into veterinary hospitals. spinal injuries occur in two ways after the trauma: the primary mechanical damage, and in secondary processes, like inflammation and scar formation, in the days following the trauma. these cells involved in the secondary damage response secrete factors that promote scar formation and inhibit cellular regeneration. mesenchymal stem cells that are induced to a neural cell fate are loaded onto a porous scaffold and are then implanted at the site of injury. the cells and scaffold secrete factors that counteract those secreted by scar forming cells and promote neural regeneration. eight weeks later, dogs treated with stem cells showed immense improvement over those treated with conventional therapies. dogs treated with stem cells were able to occasionally support their own weight, which has not been seen in dogs undergoing conventional therapies.in a study to evaluate the treatment of experimentally induced ms in dogs using laser activated non-expanded adipose derived stem cells. the results showed amelioration of the clinical signs over time confirmed by the resolution of the previous lesions on mri. positive migration of the injected cells to the site of lesion, increased remyelination detected by myelin basic proteins, positive differentiation into olig2 positive oligodendrocytes, prevented the glial scar formation and restored axonal architecture.treatments are also in clinical trials to repair and regenerate peripheral nerves. peripheral nerves are more likely to be damaged, but the effects of the damage are not as widespread as seen in injuries to the spinal cord. treatments are currently in clinical trials to repair severed nerves, with early success. stem cells induced to a neural fate injected in to a severed nerve. within four weeks, regeneration of previously damaged stem cells and completely formed nerve bundles were observed.stem cells are also in clinical phases for treatment in ophthalmology. hematopoietic stem cells have been used to treat corneal ulcers of different origin of several horses. these ulcers were resistant to conventional treatments available, but quickly responded positively to the stem cell treatment. stem cells were also able to restore sight in one eye of a horse with retinal detachment, allowing the horse to return to daily activities.

=== marketing and costs ===
in the late 1990s and early 2000s, there was an initial wave of companies and clinics offering stem cell therapy, while not substantiating health claims or having regulatory approval. by 2012, a second wave of companies and clinics had emerged, usually located in developing countries where medicine is less regulated and offering stem cell therapies on a medical tourism model. like the first wave companies and clinics, they made similar strong, but unsubstantiated, claims, mainly by clinics in the united states, mexico, thailand, india, and south africa. by 2016, research indicated that there were more than 550 stem cell clinics in the us alone selling generally unproven therapies for a wide array of medical conditions in almost every state in the country, altering the dynamic of stem cell tourism. in 2018, the fda sent a warning letter to stemgenex biologic laboratories in san diego, which marketed a service in which it took body fat from people, processed it into mixtures it said contained various forms of stem cells, and administered it back to the person by inhalation, intravenously, or infusion into their spinal cords; the company said the treatment was useful for many chronic and life-threatening conditions.costs of stem cell therapies range widely by clinic, condition, and cell type, but most commonly range between $10,000-$20,000. insurance does not cover stem cell injections at clinics so patients off turn to on-line fundraising. in 2018, the us federal trade commission found health centers and an individual physician making unsubstantiated claims for stem cell therapies, and forced refunds of some $500,000. the fda filed suit against two stem cell clinic firms around the same time, seeking permanent injunctions against their marketing and use of unapproved adipose stem cell products.


=== covid-19-related marketing and government agency responses ===
although according to the nih no stem cell treatments have been approved for covid-19 and the agency recommends against the use of mscs for the disease, some stem cell clinics began marketing both unproven and non-fda-approved stem cells and exosomes for covid-19 in 2020. the fda took prompt action by sending letters to the firms in question. the ftc also warned a stem cell firm for covid-19-related marketing.

eurostemcell: types of stem cells and their uses"
aminocoumarin resistant gyrb,antibiotic,"dna gyrase, or simply gyrase, is an enzyme within the class of topoisomerase and is a subclass of type ii topoisomerases that reduces topological strain in an atp dependent manner while double-stranded dna is being unwound by elongating rna-polymerase  or by helicase in front of the progressing replication fork. the enzyme causes negative supercoiling of the dna or relaxes positive supercoils. it does so by looping the template so as to form a crossing, then cutting one of the double helices and passing the other through it before releasing the break, changing the linking number by two in each enzymatic step. this process occurs in bacteria, whose single circular dna is cut by dna gyrase and the two ends are then twisted around each other to form supercoils. gyrase is also found in eukaryotic plastids: it has been found in the apicoplast of the malarial parasite plasmodium falciparum and in chloroplasts of several plants. bacterial dna gyrase is the target of many antibiotics, including nalidixic acid, novobiocin, and ciprofloxacin.
the unique ability of gyrase to introduce negative supercoils into dna at the expense of atp hydrolysis is what allows bacterial dna to have free negative supercoils. the ability of gyrase to relax positive supercoils comes into play during dna replication and prokaryotic transcription. the helical nature of the dna causes positive supercoils to accumulate ahead of a translocating enzyme, in the case of dna replication, a dna polymerase. the ability of gyrase (and topoisomerase iv) to relax positive supercoils allows superhelical tension ahead of the polymerase to be released so that replication can continue.


== gyrase structure ==

dna gyrase is a tetrameric enzyme that consists of 2 gyra (""a"") and 2 gyrb (""b"") subunits. structurally the complex is formed by 3 pairs of ""gates"", sequential opening and closing of which results into the direct transfer of dna segment and introduction of 2 negative supercoils. n-gates are formed by atpase domains of gyrb subunits. binding of 2 atp molecules leads to dimerization and, therefore, closing of the gates. hydrolysis, on the contrary, opens them. dna cleavage and reunion is performed by a catalytic center located in dna-gates build by all gyrase subunits. c-gates are formed by gyra subunits.


== mechanochemical model of gyrase activity ==

a single molecule study has characterized gyrase activity as a function of dna tension (applied force) and atp, and proposed a mechanochemical model. upon binding to dna (the ""gyrase-dna"" state), there is a competition between dna wrapping and dissociation, where increasing dna tension increases the probability of dissociation. according to the catalytic cycle proposed, binding of 2 atp molecules causes dimerization of atpase domains of gyrb subunits and capturing of a t-segment of dna (t- from transferring) in a cavity between gyrb subunits. on a next step the enzyme cleaves a g-segment of dna (g- from gate) making a double-strand break. then the t-segment is transferred through the break, which is accompanied by the hydrolysis of the first atp molecule. dna-gyrase ligates the break in a g-segment back and t-segment finally leaves the enzyme complex. hydrolysis of the second atp returns the system to the initial step of a cycle.
as the result of a catalytic cycle two atp molecules are hydrolyzed and two negative supercoils are introduced into the dna template. the number of superhelical turns introduced into an initially relaxed circular dna has been calculated to be approximately equal to the number of atp molecules hydrolyzed by gyrase  therefore, it can be suggested that two atp molecules are hydrolyzed per cycle of reaction by gyrase, leading to the introduction of a linking difference of -2.


== gyrase specificity ==
gyrase has a pronounced specificity to dna substrates. strong gyrase binding sites (sgs) were found in some phages (bacteriophage mu group) and plasmids (psc101, pbr322). recently, high throughput mapping of dna gyrase sites in the escherichia coli genome using topo-seq approach  revealed a long (≈130 bp) and degenerate binding motif that can explain the existence of sgss. the gyrase motif reflects wrapping of dna around the enzyme complex and dna flexibility. it contains two periodic regions in which gc-rich islands are alternated with at-rich patches by a period close to the period of dna double helix (≈10.5 bp). the two regions correspond to dna binding by c-terminal domains of gyra subunits and resemble eukaryotic nucleosome binding motif.


== inhibition by antibiotics ==
gyrase is present in prokaryotes and some eukaryotes, but the enzymes are not entirely similar in structure or sequence, and have different affinities for different molecules. this makes gyrase a good target for antibiotics. two classes of antibiotics that inhibit gyrase are:

the aminocoumarins (including novobiocin and coumermycin a1). aminocoumarins work by competitive inhibition of energy transduction of dna gyrase by binding to the atpase active site located on the gyrb subunit.
the quinolones (including nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin) . quinolones are so called topoisomerase poisons. by binding to the enzyme they trap it on a transient step of a catalytic cycle preventing the reunion of a g-segment. this results in an accumulation of double-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks and cell death. quinolone-resistant bacteria frequently harbor mutated topoisomerases that resist quinolone binding.the subunit a is selectively inactivated by antibiotics such as oxolinic and nalidixic acids. the subunit b is selectively inactivated by antibiotics such as coumermycin a1 and novobiocin. inhibition of either subunit blocks supertwisting activity.


== phage t4 ==
phage t4 genes 39, 52 and 60 encode proteins that form a dna gyrase that is employed in phage dna replication during infection of the e. coli bacterial host.  the phage gene 52 protein shares homology with the bacterial gyrase gyra subunit and the phage gene 39 protein shares homology with the gyrb subunit.  since the host e. coli dna gyrase can partially compensate for the loss of the phage gene products, mutants defective in either genes 39, 52 or 60 do not completely abolish phage dna replication, but rather delay its initiation.  mutants defective in genes 39, 52 or 60 show increased genetic recombination as well as increased base-substitution and deletion mutation suggesting that the host compensated dna synthesis is less accurate than that directed by wild-type phage.  a mutant defective in gene 39 also shows increased sensitivity to inactivation by ultraviolet irradiation during the stage of phage infection after initiation of dna replication when multiple copies of the phage chromosome are present.

"cyclin y, isoform a (fruit fly)",protein,"in molecular biology, the ben domain is a protein domain which is found in diverse proteins including:

smar1 (scaffold/matrix attachment region-binding protein 1; also known as banp), a tumour-suppressor mar-binding protein that down-regulates cyclin d1 expression by recruiting hdac1-msin3a co-repressor complex at cyclin d1 promoter locus; smar1 is the target of prostaglandin a2 (pga2) induced growth arrest.
nacc1, a novel member of the poz/btb (pox virus and zinc finger/bric-a-bractramtrack broad complex), but which varies from other proteins of this class in that it lacks the characteristic dna-binding motif.
mod(mdg4) isoform c, the modifier of the mdg4 locus in drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly), where mdg4 encodes chromatin proteins which are involved in position effect variegation, establishment of chromatin boundaries, nerve path finding, meiotic chromosome pairing and apoptosis. trans-splicing of mod(mdg4) produces at least 26 transcripts.
bend2, a protein of unknown function, that is predicted to be involved in chromatin modification and has been associated clinically with central nervous system disorders.
e5r protein from chordopoxvirus virosomes, which is found in cytoplasmic sites of viral dna replication.
several proteins of polydnaviruses.the ben domain is predicted to function as an adaptor for the higher-order structuring of chromatin, and recruitment of chromatin modifying factors in transcriptional regulation. it has been suggested to mediate protein-dna and protein-protein interactions during chromatin organization and transcription. the presence of ben domains in a poxviral early virosomal protein and in polydnaviral proteins also suggests a possible role in the organisation of viral dna during replication or transcription. they are generally linked to other globular domains with functions related to transcriptional regulation and chromatin structure, such as btb, c4dm, and c2h2 fingers.this domain is predicted to form an all-alpha fold with four conserved helices. its conservation pattern revealed several conserved residues, most of which have hydrophobic side-chains and are likely to stabilize the fold through helix-helix packing. first human ben domain (bend3)structure is solved together with tpr (ercc6l)domain and stimulates the ercc6l translocase and atpase activities(7).

ndm-1 is an enzyme that makes bacteria resistant to a broad range of beta-lactam antibiotics.
ndm-1 (new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1) originated in india. in indian hospitals hospital-acquired infections are common and with the new super-bugs on rise in india, this can make them dangerous. mapping of sewage and water supply samples that were ndm-1-positive indicates widespread infection in new delhi already back in 2011.ndm-1 was first detected in a klebsiella pneumoniae isolate from a swedish patient of indian origin in 2008. it was later detected in bacteria in india, pakistan, the united kingdom, the united states, canada and japan.

=== clostridium difficile ===
clostridium difficile is a nosocomial pathogen that causes diarrheal disease worldwide. diarrhea caused by c. difficile can be life-threatening. infections are most frequent in people who have had recent medical and/or antibiotic treatment. c. difficile infections commonly occur during hospitalization.according to a 2015 cdc report, c. difficile caused almost 500,000 infections in the united states over a year period. associated with these infections were an estimated 15,000 deaths. the cdc estimates that c. difficile infection costs could amount to $3.8 billion over a 5-year span.c. difficile colitis is most strongly associated with fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, carbapenems, and clindamycin.some research suggests the overuse of antibiotics in the raising of livestock is contributing to outbreaks of bacterial infections such as c. difficile.[16]
antibiotics, especially those with a broad activity spectrum (such as clindamycin) disrupt normal intestinal flora. this can lead to an overgrowth of c. difficile, which flourishes under these conditions. pseudomembranous colitis can follow, creating generalized inflammation of the colon and the development of ""pseudomembrane"", a viscous collection of inflammatory cells, fibrin, and necrotic cells.[4] clindamycin-resistant c. difficile was reported as the causative agent of large outbreaks of diarrheal disease in hospitals in new york, arizona, florida and massachusetts between 1989 and 1992. geographically dispersed outbreaks of c. difficile strains resistant to fluoroquinolone antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, were also reported in north america in 2005.


=== enterococcus ===
multidrug-resistant enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium are associated with nosocomial infections. these strains include: penicillin-resistant enterococcus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and linezolid-resistant enterococcus.


=== mycobacterium tuberculosis ===

tuberculosis (tb) resistant to antibiotics is called mdr tb (multidrug-resistant tb). globally, mdr tb causes 150,000 deaths annually. the rise of the hiv/aids epidemic has contributed to this.mycobacterium tuberculosis is an obligate pathogen that has evolved to ensure its persistence in human populations. this is evident in the fact that mycobacterium tuberculosis must cause a pulmonary disease in order to be successfully transmitted from one person to another. tuberculosis better known as tb has one of the highest mortality rates among pathogens in the world. mortality rates have not seen a significant decrease due to its growing resistance to certain antibiotics. although there is years worth of research and many work hours that have been devoted to the creation of a vaccine, one still does not exist. tb has a very high level of virulence which is mainly due in part to the fact it is extremely transmissible. tb was considered one of the most prevalent diseases, and did not have a cure until the discovery of streptomycin by selman waksman in 1943. however, the bacteria soon developed resistance. since then, drugs such as isoniazid and rifampin have been used. m. tuberculosis develops resistance to drugs by spontaneous mutations in its genomes. these types of mutations can lead to genotype and phenotype changes that can contribute to reproductive success therefore they can be passed on and evolve into resistant bacteria. resistance to one drug is common, and this is why treatment is usually done with more than one drug. extensively drug-resistant tb (xdr tb) is tb that is also resistant to the second line of drugs.resistance of mycobacterium tuberculosis to isoniazid, rifampin, and other common treatments has become an increasingly relevant clinical challenge. evidence is lacking for whether these bacteria have plasmids. m. tuberculosis lack the opportunity to interact with other bacteria in order to share plasmids.


=== mycoplasma genitalium ===
mycoplasma genitalium is a small pathogenic bacterium that lives on the ciliated epithelial cells of the urinary and genital tracts in humans. it is still controversial whether or not this bacterium is to be recognized as a sexually transmitted pathogen. infection with mycoplasma genitalium sometimes produces clinical symptoms, or a combination of symptoms, but sometimes can be asymptomatic. it causes inflammation in the urethra (urethritis) both in men and women, which is associated with mucopurulent discharge in the urinary tract, and burning while urinating.
treatment of mycoplasma genitalium infections is becoming increasingly difficult due to rapidly developing multi-drug resistance, and diagnosis and treatment is further hampered by the fact that m. genitalium infections are not routinely detected. azithromycin is the most common first-line treatment, but the commonly-used 1 gram single-dose azithromycin treatment can lead to the bacteria commonly developing resistance to azithromycin. an alternative five-day treatment with azithromycin showed no development of antimicrobial resistance. efficacy of azithromycin against m. genitalium has decreased substantially, which is thought to occur through snps in the 23s rrna gene. the same snps are thought to be responsible for resistance against josamycin which is prescribed in some countries. moxifloxacin can be used as a second-line treatment in case azithromycin is not able to eradicate the infection. however, resistance against moxifloxacin has been observed since 2007, thought to be due to parc snps. tetracyclines, including doxycycline, have a low clinical eradication rate for m. genitalium infections. a few cases have been described where doxycycline, azithromycin and moxifloxacin had all failed, but pristinamycin was still able to eradicate the infection.


=== staphylococcus aureus ===

staphylococcus aureus is one of the major resistant pathogens. found on the mucous membranes and the human skin of around a third of the population, it is extremely adaptable to antibiotic pressure. it was one of the earlier bacteria in which penicillin resistance was found—in 1947, just four years after the drug started being mass-produced. methicillin was then the antibiotic of choice, but has since been replaced by oxacillin because of significant kidney toxicity. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was first detected in britain in 1961, and is now ""quite common"" in hospitals. mrsa was responsible for 37% of fatal cases of sepsis in the uk in 1999, up from 4% in 1991. half of all s. aureus infections in the us are resistant to penicillin, methicillin, tetracycline and erythromycin.


=== streptococcus ===
streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus: gas) infections can usually be treated with many different antibiotics. strains of s. pyogenes resistant to macrolide antibiotics have emerged; however, all strains remain uniformly susceptible to penicillin.resistance of streptococcus pneumoniae to penicillin and other beta-lactams is increasing worldwide. the major mechanism of resistance involves the introduction of mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. selective pressure is thought to play an important role, and use of beta-lactam antibiotics has been implicated as a risk factor for infection and colonization. s. pneumoniae is responsible for pneumonia, bacteremia, otitis media, meningitis, sinusitis, peritonitis and arthritis.


== gram negative ==


=== campylobacter ===
campylobacter causes diarrhea (often bloody), fever, and abdominal cramps. serious complications such as temporary paralysis can also occur. physicians rely on ciprofloxacin and azithromycin for treating patients with severe disease although campylobacter is showing resistance to these antibiotics.


=== neisseria gonorrhoeae ===

neisseria gonorrhoeae is a sexually transmitted pathogen that causes gonorrhea, a sexually transmitted disease that can result in discharge and inflammation at the urethra, cervix, pharynx, or rectum. it can cause pelvic pain, pain on urination, penile and vaginal discharge, as well as systemic symptoms. it can also cause severe reproductive complications.


=== gamma proteobacteria ===


==== enterobacteriaceae ====
as of 2013 hard-to-treat or untreatable infections of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (cre), also known as carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe), were increasing among patients in medical facilities. cre are resistant to nearly all available antibiotics. almost half of hospital patients who get bloodstream cre infections die from the infection.


===== klebsiella pneumoniae =====
klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc)-producing bacteria are a group of emerging highly drug-resistant gram-negative bacilli causing infections associated with significant morbidity and mortality whose incidence is rapidly increasing in a variety of clinical settings around the world. klebsiella pneumoniae includes numerous mechanisms for antibiotic resistance, many of which are located on highly mobile genetic elements. carbapenem antibiotics (heretofore often the treatment of last resort for resistant infections) are generally not effective against kpc-producing organisms.


===== salmonella and e. coli =====
infection with escherichia coli and salmonella can result from the consumption of contaminated food and polluted water. both of these bacteria are well known for causing nosocomial (hospital-linked) infections, and often, these strains found in hospitals are antibiotic resistant because of adaptations to wide spread antibiotic use. when both bacteria are spread, serious health conditions arise. many people are hospitalized each year after becoming infected, with some dying as a result. since 1993, some strains of e. coli have become resistant to multiple types of fluoroquinolone antibiotics.although mutation alone plays a huge role in the development of antibiotic resistance, a 2008 study found that high survival rates after exposure to antibiotics could not be accounted for by mutation alone. this study focused on the development of resistance in e. coli to three antibiotic drugs: ampicillin, tetracycline, and nalidixic acid. the researchers found that some antibiotic resistance in e. coli developed because of epigenetic inheritance rather than by direct inheritance of a mutated gene. this was further supported by data showing that reversion to antibiotic sensitivity was relatively common as well. this could only be explained by epigenetics. epigenetics is a type of inheritance in which gene expression is altered rather than the genetic code itself. there are many modes by which this alteration of gene expression can occur, including methylation of dna and histone modification; however, the important point is that both inheritance of random mutations and epigenetic markers can result in the expression of antibiotic resistance genes.resistance to polymyxins first appear in 2011. an easier way for this resistance to spread, a plasmid known as mcr-1 was discovered in 2015.


==== pseudomonadales ====


==== acinetobacter ====
acinetobacter is a gram-negative bacteria that causes pneumonia or bloodstream infections in critically ill patients. multidrug-resistant acinetobacter have become very resistant to antibiotics.on november 5, 2004, the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) reported an increasing number of acinetobacter baumannii bloodstream infections in patients at military medical facilities in which service members injured in the iraq/kuwait region during operation iraqi freedom and in afghanistan during operation enduring freedom were treated. most of these showed multidrug resistance (mrab), with a few isolates resistant to all drugs tested.


===== pseudomonas aeruginosa =====
pseudomonas aeruginosa is a highly prevalent opportunistic pathogen. one of the most worrisome characteristics of p. aeruginosa is its low antibiotic susceptibility, which is attributable to a concerted action of multidrug efflux pumps with chromosomally encoded antibiotic resistance genes (e.g., mexab-oprm, mexxy) and the low permeability of the bacterial cellular envelopes. p. aeruginosa has the ability to produce 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines (haqs) and it has been found that haqs have prooxidant effects, and overexpressing modestly increased susceptibility to antibiotics. the study experimented with the p. aeruginosa biofilms and found that a disruption of rela and spot genes produced an inactivation of the stringent response (sr) in cells with nutrient limitation, which provides cells be more susceptible to antibiotics.

luminal epithelial cell of mammary gland,cell,"a mammary gland is an exocrine gland in humans and other mammals that produces milk to feed young offspring. mammals get their name from the latin word mamma, ""breast"". the mammary glands are arranged in organs such as the breasts in primates (for example, humans and chimpanzees), the udder in ruminants (for example, cows, goats, and deer), and the dugs of other animals (for example, dogs and cats). lactorrhea, the occasional production of milk by the glands, can occur in any mammal, but in most mammals, lactation, the production of enough milk for nursing, occurs only in phenotypic females who have gestated in recent months or years. it is directed by hormonal guidance from sex steroids. in a few mammalian species, male lactation can occur. with humans, male lactation can occur only under specific circumstances.


== structure ==

the basic components of a mature mammary gland are the alveoli (hollow cavities, a few millimeters large) lined with milk-secreting cuboidal cells and surrounded by myoepithelial cells. these alveoli join to form groups known as lobules. each lobule has a lactiferous duct that drains into openings in the nipple. the myoepithelial cells contract under the stimulation of oxytocin, excreting the milk secreted by alveolar units into the lobule lumen toward the nipple. as the infant begins to suck, the oxytocin-mediated ""let down reflex"" ensues and the mother's milk is secreted — not sucked from the gland — into the baby's mouth.
all the milk-secreting tissue leading to a single lactiferous duct is called a ""simple mammary gland""; in a ""complex mammary gland"" all the simple mammary glands serve one nipple. humans normally have two complex mammary glands, one in each breast, and each complex mammary gland consists of 10–20 simple glands. the presence of more than two nipples is known as polythelia and the presence of more than two complex mammary glands as polymastia.
maintaining the correct polarized morphology of the lactiferous duct tree requires another essential component – mammary epithelial cells extracellular matrix (ecm) which, together with adipocytes, fibroblast, inflammatory cells, and others, constitute mammary stroma. mammary epithelial ecm mainly contains myoepithelial basement membrane and the connective tissue. they not only help to support mammary basic structure, but also serve as a communicating bridge between mammary epithelia and their local and global environment throughout this organ's development.


=== histology ===

a mammary gland is a specific type of apocrine gland specialized for manufacture of colostrum when giving birth. mammary glands can be identified as apocrine because they exhibit striking ""decapitation"" secretion. many sources assert that mammary glands are modified sweat glands. some authors dispute that and argue instead that they are sebaceous glands.


== development ==

mammary glands develop during different growth cycles. they exist in both sexes during embryonic stage, forming only a rudimentary duct tree at birth. in this stage, mammary gland development depends on systemic (and maternal) hormones, but is also under the (local) regulation of paracrine communication between neighboring epithelial and mesenchymal cells by parathyroid hormone-related protein (pthrp). this locally secreted factor gives rise to a series of outside-in and inside-out positive feedback between these two types of cells, so that mammary bud epithelial cells can proliferate and sprout down into the mesenchymal layer until they reach the fat pad to begin the first round of branching. at the same time, the embryonic mesenchymal cells around the epithelial bud receive secreting factors activated by pthrp, such as bmp4. these mesenchymal cells can transform into a dense, mammary-specific mesenchyme, which later develop into connective tissue with fibrous threads, forming blood vessels and the lymph system. a basement membrane, mainly containing laminin and collagen, formed afterward by differentiated myoepithelial cells, keeps the polarity of this primary duct tree. these components of the extracellular matrix are strong determinants of duct morphogenesis.

estrogen and growth hormone (gh) are essential for the ductal component of mammary gland development, and act synergistically to mediate it. neither estrogen nor gh are capable of inducing ductal development without the other. the role of gh in ductal development has been found to be mostly mediated by its induction of the secretion of insulin-like growth factor 1 (igf-1), which occurs both systemically (mainly originating from the liver) and locally in the mammary fat pad through activation of the growth hormone receptor (ghr). however, gh itself also acts independently of igf-1 to stimulate ductal development by upregulating estrogen receptor (er) expression in mammary gland tissue, which is a downstream effect of mammary gland ghr activation. in any case, unlike igf-1, gh itself is not essential for mammary gland development, and igf-1 in conjunction with estrogen can induce normal mammary gland development without the presence of gh. in addition to igf-1, other paracrine growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (egf), transforming growth factor beta (tgf-β), amphiregulin, fibroblast growth factor (fgf), and hepatocyte growth factor (hgf) are involved in breast development as mediators downstream to sex hormones and gh/igf-1.during embryonic development, igf-1 levels are low, and gradually increase from birth to puberty. at puberty, the levels of gh and igf-1 reach their highest levels in life and estrogen begins to be secreted in high amounts in females, which is when ductal development mostly takes place. under the influence of estrogen, stromal and fat tissue surrounding the ductal system in the mammary glands also grows. after puberty, gh and igf-1 levels progressively decrease, which limits further development until pregnancy, if it occurs. during pregnancy, progesterone and prolactin are essential for mediating lobuloalveolar development in estrogen-primed mammary gland tissue, which occurs in preparation of lactation and nursing.androgens such as testosterone inhibit estrogen-mediated mammary gland development (e.g., by reducing local er expression) through activation of androgen receptors expressed in mammary gland tissue, and in conjunction with relatively low estrogen levels, are the cause of the lack of developed mammary glands in males.


=== timeline ===


==== before birth ====
mammary gland development is characterized by the unique process by which the epithelium invades the stroma. the development of the mammary gland occurs mainly after birth. during puberty, tubule formation is coupled with branching morphogenesis which establishes the basic arboreal network of ducts emanating from the nipple.developmentally, mammary gland epithelium is constantly produced and maintained by rare epithelial cells, dubbed as mammary progenitors which are ultimately thought to be derived from tissue-resident stem cells.embryonic mammary gland development can be divided into a series of specific stages. initially, the formation of the milk lines that run between the fore and hind limbs bilaterally on each side of the midline occurs around embryonic day 10.5 (e10.5). the second stage occurs at e11.5 when placode formation begins along the mammary milk line.  this will eventually give rise to the nipple. lastly, the third stage occurs at e12.5 and involves the invagination of cells within the placode into the mesenchyme, leading to a mammary anlage (biology).the primitive (stem) cells are detected in embryo and their numbers increase steadily during development


==== growth ====
postnatally, the mammary ducts elongate into the mammary fat pad. then, starting around four weeks of age, mammary ductal growth increases significantly with the ducts invading towards the lymph node. terminal end buds, the highly proliferative structures found at the tips of the invading ducts, expand and increase greatly during this stage. this developmental period is characterized by the emergence of the terminal end buds and lasts until an age of about 7–8 weeks.
by the pubertal stage, the mammary ducts have invaded to the end of the mammary fat pad. at this point, the terminal end buds become less proliferative and decrease in size. side branches form from the primary ducts and begin to fill the mammary fat pad. ductal development decreases with the arrival of sexual maturity and undergoes estrous cycles (proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus). as a result of estrous cycling, the mammary gland undergoes dynamic changes where cells proliferate and then regress in an ordered fashion.


==== pregnancy ====
during pregnancy, the ductal systems undergo rapid proliferation and form alveolar structures within the branches to be used for milk production. after delivery, lactation occurs within the mammary gland; lactation involves the secretion of milk by the luminal cells in the alveoli. contraction of the myoepithelial cells surrounding the alveoli will cause the milk to be ejected through the ducts and into the nipple for the nursing infant. upon weaning of the infant, lactation stops and the mammary gland turns in on itself, a process called involution. this process involves the controlled collapse of mammary epithelial cells where cells begin apoptosis in a controlled manner, reverting the mammary gland back to a pubertal state.


==== postmenopausal ====
during postmenopause, due to much lower levels of estrogen, and due to lower levels of gh and igf-1, which decrease with age, mammary gland tissue atrophies and the mammary glands become smaller.


== physiology ==


=== hormonal control ===
lactiferous duct development occurs in females in response to circulating hormones. first development is frequently seen during pre- and postnatal stages, and later during puberty. estrogen promotes branching differentiation, whereas in males testosterone inhibits it. a mature duct tree reaching the limit of the fat pad of the mammary gland comes into being by bifurcation of duct terminal end buds (teb), secondary branches sprouting from primary ducts and proper duct lumen formation. these processes are tightly modulated by components of mammary epithelial ecm interacting with systemic hormones and local secreting factors. however, for each mechanism the epithelial cells' ""niche"" can be delicately unique with different membrane receptor profiles and basement membrane thickness from specific branching area to area, so as to regulate cell growth or differentiation sub-locally. important players include beta-1 integrin, epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr), laminin-1/5, collagen-iv, matrix metalloproteinase(mmps), heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and others. elevated circulating level of growth hormone and estrogen get to multipotent cap cells on teb tips through a thin, leaky layer of basement membrane. these hormones promote specific gene expression. hence cap cells can differentiate into myoepithelial and luminal (duct) epithelial cells, and the increased amount of activated mmps can degrade surrounding ecm helping duct buds to reach further in the fat pads. on the other hand, basement membrane along the mature mammary ducts is thicker, with strong adhesion to epithelial cells via binding to integrin and non-integrin receptors. when side branches develop, it is a much more ""pushing-forward"" working process including extending through myoepithelial cells, degrading basement membrane and then invading into a periductal layer of fibrous stromal tissue. degraded basement membrane fragments (laminin-5) roles to lead the way of mammary epithelial cells migration. whereas, laminin-1 interacts with non-integrin receptor dystroglycan negatively regulates this side branching process in case of cancer. these complex ""yin-yang"" balancing crosstalks between mammary ecm and epithelial cells ""instruct"" healthy mammary gland development until adult.
there is preliminary evidence that soybean intake mildly stimulates the breast glands in pre- and postmenopausal women.


=== pregnancy ===
secretory alveoli develop mainly in pregnancy, when rising levels of prolactin, estrogen, and progesterone cause further branching, together with an increase in adipose tissue and a richer blood flow. in gestation, serum progesterone remains at a stably high concentration so signaling through its receptor is continuously activated. as one of the transcribed genes, wnts secreted from mammary epithelial cells act paracrinely to induce more neighboring cells' branching. when the lactiferous duct tree is almost ready, ""leaves"" alveoli are differentiated from luminal epithelial cells and added at the end of each branch. in late pregnancy and for the first few days after giving birth, colostrum is secreted. milk secretion (lactation) begins a few days later due to reduction in circulating progesterone and the presence of another important hormone prolactin, which mediates further alveologenesis, milk protein production, and regulates osmotic balance and tight junction function. laminin and collagen in myoepithelial basement membrane interacting with beta-1 integrin on epithelial surface again, is essential in this process. their binding ensures correct placement of prolactin receptors on the basal lateral side of alveoli cells and directional secretion of milk into lactiferous ducts. suckling of the baby causes release of the hormone oxytocin, which stimulates contraction of the myoepithelial cells. in this combined control from ecm and systemic hormones, milk secretion can be reciprocally amplified so as to provide enough nutrition for the baby.


=== weaning ===
during weaning, decreased prolactin, missing mechanical stimulation (baby suckling), and changes in osmotic balance caused by milk stasis and leaking of tight junctions cause cessation of milk production. it is the (passive) process of a child or animal ceasing to be dependent on the mother for nourishment. in some species there is complete or partial involution of alveolar structures after weaning, in humans there is only partial involution and the level of involution in humans appears to be highly individual. the glands in the breast do secrete fluid also in nonlactating women. in some other species (such as cows), all alveoli and secretory duct structures collapse by programmed cell death (apoptosis) and autophagy for lack of growth promoting factors either from the ecm or circulating hormones. at the same time, apoptosis of blood capillary endothelial cells speeds up the regression of lactation ductal beds. shrinkage of the mammary duct tree and ecm remodeling by various proteinase is under the control of somatostatin and other growth inhibiting hormones and local factors. this major structural change leads loose fat tissue to fill the empty space afterward. but a functional lactiferous duct tree can be formed again when a female is pregnant again.


== clinical significance ==
tumorigenesis in mammary glands can be induced biochemically by abnormal expression level of circulating hormones or local ecm components, or from a mechanical change in the tension of mammary stroma. under either of the two circumstances, mammary epithelial cells would grow out of control and eventually result in cancer. almost all instances of breast cancer originate in the lobules or ducts of the mammary glands.


== other mammals ==


=== general ===
the breasts of the adult human female vary from most other mammals that tend to have less conspicuous mammary glands. the number and positioning of mammary glands varies widely in different mammals. the protruding teats and accompanying glands can be located anywhere along the two milk lines. in general most mammals develop mammary glands in pairs along these lines, with a number approximating the number of young typically birthed at a time. the number of teats varies from 2 (in most primates) to 18 (in pigs). the virginia opossum has 13, one of the few mammals with an odd number. the following table lists the number and position of teats and glands found in a range of mammals:

male mammals typically have rudimentary mammary glands and nipples, with a few exceptions: male mice do not have nipples, male marsupials do not have mammary glands, and male horses lack nipples and mammary glands. the male dayak fruit bat has lactating mammary glands. male lactation occurs infrequently in some species.mammary glands are true protein factories, and several labs have constructed transgenic animals, mainly goats and cows, to produce proteins for pharmaceutical use. complex glycoproteins such as monoclonal antibodies or antithrombin cannot be produced by genetically engineered bacteria, and the production in live mammals is much cheaper than the use of mammalian cell cultures.


=== evolution ===
there are many theories on how mammary glands evolved. for example, it is thought that the mammary gland is a transformed sweat gland, more closely related to apocrine sweat glands. because mammary glands do not fossilize well, supporting such theories with fossil evidence is difficult. many of the current theories are based on comparisons between lines of living mammals—monotremes, marsupials, and eutherians. one theory proposes that mammary glands evolved from glands that were used to keep the eggs of early mammals moist and free from infection (monotremes still lay eggs). other theories suggest that early secretions were used directly by hatched young, or that the secretions were used by young to help them orient to their mothers.lactation is thought to have developed long before the evolution of the mammary gland and mammals; see evolution of lactation.

21-deoxycortisol,non_science,"21-deoxycortisol, also known as 11β,17α-dihydroxyprogesterone or as 11β,17α-dihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, is a naturally occurring, endogenous steroid related to cortisol (11β,17α,21-trihydroxyprogesterone) which is formed as a metabolite from 17α-hydroxyprogesterone via 11β-hydroxylase.


== marker of 21-hydroxylase deficiency ==
21-deoxycortisol is a marker of congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, even in mild (non-classic) cases. the deficiency of the 21-hydroxylase enzyme leads to excess of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, a 21-carbon (c21) steroid. this excess is accompanied by the accumulation of other c21 steroids, such as 21-deoxycortisol, which is formed by the 11β-hydroxylation of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone via 11β-hydroxylase (cyp11b1). the build-up of 21-deoxycortisol in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia have been described since at least 1955, this steroid was then called ""21-desoxyhydrocortisone"". unlike 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, 21-deoxycortisol is not produced in the gonads and is uniquely adrenal-derived. hence, 21-deoxycortisol is a more specific biomarker of 21-hydroxylase deficiency than is 17α-hydroxyprogesterone.the corticosteroid activity of 21-deoxycortisol is lower to that of cortisol.as 21-deoxycortisol can be at high levels in congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and it has structural similarity to cortisol, it can cross-react in immunoassays, resulting in a falsely normal or high cortisol result, when the true cortisol is actually low. whereas immunoassays can suffer from cross-reactivity due to interactions with structural analogues, the selectivity offered by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (lc-ms/ms) has largely overcome these limitations. hence, the use of lc-ms/ms instead of immunoassays in cortisol measurement aims to provide greater specificity.besides 21-deoxycortisol, another c21 steroid, 21-deoxycorticosterone (11β-hydroxyprogesterone), has been proposed as a marker for 21-hydroxylase deficiency, but this marker did not gain acceptance due to the fact that testing for the levels of this steroid is not routinely offered by diagnostic laboratories.

coatomer subunit gamma-2 isoform m2 (mouse),protein,"coatomer subunit alpha is a protein that in humans is encoded by the copa gene.


== function ==
in eukaryotic cells, protein transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi compartments is mediated in part by non-clathrin-coated vesicular coat proteins (cops). seven coat proteins have been identified, and they represent subunits of a complex known as coatomer. the subunits are designated alpha-cop, beta-cop, beta-prime-cop, gamma-cop, delta-cop, epsilon-cop, and zeta-cop. the alpha-cop, encoded by copa, shares high sequence similarity with ret1, the homologous alpha subunit of the coatomer complex in yeast. also, the n-terminal 25 amino acids of alpha-cop encode the bioactive peptide, xenin, which stimulates exocrine pancreatic secretion and may act as a gastrointestinal hormone. alternative splicing results in multiple splice forms encoding distinct isoforms.

iron sucrose injection,drug,"intravenous iron sucrose is a commonly used treatment for iron deficiency anemia. iron sucrose replaces iron in the blood to foster red blood cell production in patients with chronic kidney disease. iron sucrose has the trade name venofer.


== chemical structure ==
the chemical formula of iron sucrose is c12h29fe5na2o23. the iron sucrose molecule is a polymer with two main molecules; sucrose (chemical formula c12h22o11) and an iron (iii) hydroxide (na2fe5o8•3(h2o)). these two components are in solution together, but are not bound to one another. iron sucrose is a type ii complex, with two oxygen atoms bonded to each iron atom. when used for medicinal purposes, the iron complex is polymerized and the sucrose molecules combined to form a larger polysaccharide. the number of polymerizations does not have to be the same as the number of sucrose molecules in the polysaccharide.


== history ==
iron sucrose's first known use was in europe in 1949, but it was not used in us medicine until november 2000. it replaced iron dextran, which had been in use in the us since the 1900s, as a treatment for iron deficiency. iron dextran was only used for extremely high risk situations, because it released enough iron at once to be toxic to the body. further development of iron dextran was able to lower these reactions, but also caused more severe gastrointestinal problems. these compounds caused issues mostly because of their high molecular weights. low molecular weight alternatives were eventually introduced to counter these risks. the first of these was ferric gluconate in 1999, which lowered the risk of unwanted gastrointestinal issues. iron sucrose followed shortly after, and had an even greater effect on reducing the frequency of serious adverse side effects.


== medical uses ==
iron sucrose is a dark brown liquid solution. it is administered intravenously and is only used when a patient with iron deficiency cannot be treated using oral iron options. it is a generally effective drug, with more than 80% of patients responding to treatment. iron sucrose has ~20 mg of iron per ml of solution. a typical adult patient can safely receive 600 mg of iron sucrose per week, administered in separate doses of 200–300 mg. most patients experience an increase in their hemoglobin levels of at least 20 g/l. administration usually takes from fifteen to thirty minutes and is done by a medical professional. often, saline solution is mixed with the iron sucrose during injection.once iron sucrose has been administered, it is transferred to ferritin, the normal iron storage protein. then, it is broken down in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. the iron is then either stored for later use in the body or taken up by plasma. the plasma transfers the iron to hemoglobin, where it can begin increasing red blood cell production.iron sucrose is most commonly used to treat iron deficiency anemia, which can be caused by chronic kidney disease.


== risks and side effects ==
iron sucrose can have a multitude of unintended side effects during and after administration. the following symptoms are considered serious, and a patient experiencing them should seek immediate medical attention:

headache
blurry vision
lasting dizziness or faintness
fever
chest pain or tightness
difficulty breathing
unusual heartbeat
unusual tingling
sudden weight change
swelling and bloatingless serious symptoms, which only need to be addressed by a medical professional if they are long-lasting, include:

sweetly-scented breath
difficulty tasting
nausea
eye pain, irritation, or swelling
diarrhea
pain at the injection site
body cramping, aching, pain, or weakness
issues moving
chillsdizziness and fainting during treatment is not uncommon and can be addressed during treatment by a medical professional. these symptoms are also common when the dose the patient receives is raised.iron sucrose has also been shown to significantly lower the risk of gastrointestinal problems when compared to oral iron treatments. it has a much lower rate of serious allergic reactions in comparison to other iron substitution treatments (around 0.002% in iron sucrose in comparison to 0.04-2.3% in other treatments). in iron sucrose, there have been no reported cases of these reactions being deadly.

neuronal cell adhesion molecule isoform h3 (human),protein,"neural cell adhesion molecule (ncam), also called cd56, is a homophilic binding glycoprotein expressed on the surface of neurons, glia and skeletal muscle. although cd56 is often considered a marker of neural lineage commitment due to its discovery site, cd56 expression is also found in, among others, the hematopoietic system. here, the expression of cd56 is mostly associated with, but not limited to, natural killer cells. cd56 has been detected on other lymphoid cells, including gamma delta (γδ) τ cells and activated cd8+ t cells, as well as on dendritic cells. ncam has been implicated as having a role in cell–cell adhesion, neurite outgrowth, synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory.


== forms, domains and homophilic binding ==
ncam is a glycoprotein of immunoglobulin (ig) superfamily.
at least 27 alternatively spliced ncam mrnas are produced, giving a wide diversity of ncam isoforms. the three main isoforms of ncam vary only in their cytoplasmic domain: 

ncam-120kda (gpi anchored)
ncam-140kda (short cytoplasmic domain)
ncam-180kda (long cytoplasmic domain)the extracellular domain of ncam consists of five immunoglobulin-like (ig) domains followed by two fibronectin type iii (fniii) domains. the different domains of ncam have been shown to have different roles, with the ig domains being involved in homophilic binding to ncam, and the fniii domains being involved signalling leading to neurite outgrowth.
homophilic binding occurs between ncam molecules on opposing surfaces (trans-) and ncam molecules on the same surface (cis-)1. there is much controversy as to how exactly ncam homophilic binding is arranged both in trans- and cis-. current models suggest trans- homophilic binding occurs between two ncam molecules binding antiparallel between all five ig domains or just igi and igii. cis- homophilic binding is thought to occur by interactions between both igi and igii, and igi and igiii, forming a higher order ncam multimer. both cis- and trans- ncam homophilic binding have been shown to be important in ncam “activation” leading to neurite outgrowth.


== minor exons ==
another layer of complexity is created by the insertion of other ""minor"" exons in the ncam transcript. the two most notable are:

the vase (variable domain spliced exon) exon which is thought to correlate with an inhibition of the neurite outgrowth promoting properties of ncam.
the msd (muscle specific domain), which is thought to play a positive role in myoblast fusion. in skeletal muscle it is found in all three ncam isoforms, increasing their mw, giving ncam-125, ncam-145, and ncam-185 isoforms, but is most commonly found in the ncam-125 isoform.


== posttranslational modification ==
ncam exhibits glycoforms as it can be posttranslationally modified by the addition of polysialic acid (psa) to the fifth ig domain, which is thought to abrogate its homophilic binding properties and can lead to reduced cell adhesion important in cell migration and invasion. psa has been shown to be critical in learning and memory. removal of psa from ncam by the enzyme endoneuraminidase (endon) has been shown to abolish long-term potentiation (ltp) and long-term depression (ltd).


== expression in normal cells ==
the neural cell adhesion molecule ncam1 appears on early embryonic cells and is important in the formation of cell collectives and their boundaries at sites of morphogenesis.
later in development, ncam1 (cd56) expression is found on various differentiated tissues and is a major cam mediating adhesion among neurons and between neurons and muscle.


== function ==
ncam is thought to signal to induce neurite outgrowth via the fibroblast growth factor receptor (fgfr) and act upon the p59fyn signaling pathway.
in nerves, ncam1 regulates homophilic (like-like) interactions between neurons and between neurons and muscle; it associates with fibroblast growth factor receptor (fgfr) and stimulates tyrosine kinase activity of receptor to induce neurite outgrowth. when neural crest cells stop making n-cam and n-cadherin, and start displaying integrin receptors, cells separate and migrate.
during hematopoiesis, cd56 is the prototypic marker of nk cells, also present on subset of cd4+ t cells and cd8+ t cells.
in cell adhesion, cd56 contributes to cell-cell adhesion or cell-matrix adhesion during embryonic development.


== pathology ==
in anatomic pathology, pathologists make use of cd56 immunohistochemistry to recognize certain tumors.  

normal cells that stain positively for cd56 include nk cells, activated t cells, the brain and cerebellum, and neuroendocrine tissues.
tumors that are cd56-positive are myeloma, myeloid leukemia, neuroendocrine tumors, wilms' tumor, neuroblastoma, extranodal nk/t-cell lymphoma, nasal type, pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma, small cell lung carcinoma, and the ewing's sarcoma family of tumors.


=== cancer ===
a member of the ncam superfamily, ncam2 gene has been observed progressively downregulated in human papillomavirus-positive neoplastic keratinocytes derived from uterine cervical  preneoplastic lesions at different levels of malignancy. for this reason, ncam2 is likely to be associated with tumorigenesis and may be a potential prognostic marker for uterine cervical preneoplastic lesions progression.


=== alzheimer's disease ===
ncam2 is found in lower levels in hippocampal synapses of alzheimer's disease sufferers and is found to be broken down by beta-amyloid.


== anti-ncam therapy ==
ncam has been used as a target molecule for experimental antibody-based immunotherapy. successful radio-immunolocalisation of metastases was demonstrated after giving injections of ncam-binding 123j-uj13a or 131j-uj13a radio-immunoconjugates to children with neuroblastoma. patients with small cell lung cancer were treated with the anti-ncam immunotoxine hun901-dm1 in two different clinical studies, revealing acceptable toxicity and signs of clinical response.

"complement component c7, signal peptide removed form",protein,"complement component 3, often simply called c3, is a protein of the immune system. it plays a central role in the complement system and contributes to innate immunity. in humans it is encoded on chromosome 19 by a gene called c3.


== function ==
c3 plays a central role in the activation of the complement system. its activation is required for both classical and alternative complement activation pathways. people with c3 deficiency are susceptible to bacterial infection.one form of c3-convertase, also known as c4b2a, is formed by a heterodimer of activated forms of c4 and c2. it catalyzes the proteolytic cleavage of c3 into c3a and c3b, generated during activation through the classical pathway as well as the lectin pathway. c3a is an anaphylotoxin and the precursor of some cytokines such as asp, and c3b serves as an opsonizing agent. factor i can cleave c3b into c3c and c3d, the latter of which plays a role in enhancing b cell responses. in the alternative complement pathway, c3 is cleaved by c3bbb, another form of c3-convertase composed of activated forms of c3 (c3b) and factor b (bb). once c3 is activated to c3b, it exposes a reactive thioester that allows the peptide to covalently attach to any surface that can provide a nucleophile such as a primary amine or a hydroxyl group. activated c3 can then interact with factor b. factor b is then activated by factor d, to form bb. the resultant complex, c3bbb, is called the alternative pathway (ap) c3 convertase.
c3bbb is deactivated in steps. first, the proteolytic component of the convertase, bb, is removed by complement regulatory proteins having decay-accelerating factor (daf) activity. next, c3b is broken down progressively to first ic3b, then c3c + c3dg, and then finally c3d. factor i is the protease cleaves c3b but requires a cofactor (e.g factor h, cr1, mcp or c4bp) for activity.


== structure ==
several crystallographic structures of c3 have been determined and reveal that this protein contains 13 domains.
the c3 precursor protein is first processed by the removal of 4 arginin residues, forming two chains, beta and alpha, linked by a disulfide bond. the c3 convertase activates c3 by cleaving the alpha chain, releasing c3a anaphylatoxin and generating c3b (beta chain + alpha' (alpha prime) chain).


== biochemistry ==


=== biosynthesis ===
in humans, c3 is predominantly synthesised by liver hepatocytes and to some degree by epidermis keratinocytes.


== clinical use ==
levels of c3 in the blood may be measured to support or refute a particular medical diagnosis. for example, low c3 levels are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (sle)
and some types of kidney disease such as post-infectious glomerulonephritis, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, and shunt nephritis. 

.c3 may be lost in urine in nephrotic syndrome


== interactions ==
complement component 3 has been shown to interact with factor h.


== pathology ==
deficiencies in c3 lead to genetic infections, usually fatal to the newborn.

self-concept is distinguishable from self-awareness, which refers to the extent to which self-knowledge is defined, consistent, and currently applicable to one's attitudes and dispositions. self-concept also differs from self-esteem: self-concept is a cognitive or descriptive component of one's self (e.g. ""i am a fast runner""), while self-esteem is evaluative and opinionated (e.g. ""i feel good about being a fast runner"").
self-concept is made up of one's self-schemas, and interacts with self-esteem, self-knowledge, and the social self to form the self as a whole. it includes the past, present, and future selves, where future selves (or possible selves) represent individuals' ideas of what they might become, what they would like to become, or what they are afraid of becoming. possible selves may function as incentives for certain behaviour.the perception people have about their past or future selves relates to their perception of their current selves. the temporal self-appraisal theory argues that people have a tendency to maintain a positive self-evaluation by distancing themselves from their negative self and paying more attention to their positive one. in addition, people have a tendency to perceive the past self less favourably (e.g. ""i'm better than i used to be"") and the future self more positively (e.g. ""i will be better than i am now"").


== history ==
psychologists carl rogers and abraham maslow had major influence in popularizing the idea of self-concept in the west. according to rogers, everyone strives to reach an ""ideal self."" he believed that a man gets to self-actualize when he proves himself that he is capable to achieve his goals and desires, but in order to attain his fullest potential, the person must have been raised in healthy surroundings which consist of ""genuineness, acceptance, and empathy"", however, the lack of relationships with people that have healthy personalities will stop the person to grow ""like a tree without sunlight and water"" and affect the individual's process to accomplish self- actualization. rogers also hypothesized that psychologically healthy people actively move away from roles created by others' expectations, and instead look within themselves for validation. on the other hand, neurotic people have ""self-concepts that do not match their experiences. they are afraid to accept their own experiences as valid, so they distort them, either to protect themselves or to win approval from others.""abraham maslow applied his concept of self-actualization in his hierarchy of needs theory. in this theory, he explained the process it takes for a person to achieve self-actualization. he argues that for an individual to get to the ""higher level growth needs"", he must first accomplish ""lower deficit needs"". once the ""deficiency needs"" have been achieved, the person’s goal is to accomplish the next step, which is the ""being needs"". maslow noticed that once individuals reach this level, they tend to ""grow as a person"" and reach self-actualization. however, individuals who experienced negative events while being in the lower deficit needs level prevents them from ascending in the hierarchy of needs.the self-categorization theory developed by john turner states that the self-concept consists of at least two ""levels"": a personal identity and a social one. in other words, one's self-evaluation relies on self-perceptions and how others perceive them. self-concept can alternate rapidly between one's personal and social identity. children and adolescents begin integrating social identity into their own self-concept in elementary school by assessing their position among peers. by age 5, acceptance from peers significantly affects children's self-concept, affecting their behaviour and academic success.


== model ==
the self-concept is an internal model that uses self-assessments in order to define one's self-schemas. features such as personality, skills and abilities, occupation and hobbies, physical characteristics, gender, etc. are assessed and applied to self-schemas, which are ideas of oneself in a particular dimension (e.g., someone that considers themselves a geek will associate ""geek-like"" qualities to themselves). a collection of self-schemas makes up one's overall self-concept. for example, the statement ""i am lazy"" is a self-assessment that contributes to self-concept. statements such as ""i am tired"", however, would not be part of someone's self-concept, since being tired is a temporary state and therefore cannot become a part of a self-schema. a person's self-concept may change with time as reassessment occurs, which in extreme cases can lead to identity crises.


=== parts ===
according to carl rogers, the self-concept has three different components:
the view one has of oneself (self-image)
how much value one places on oneself (self-esteem or self-worth)
what one wishes one were really like (ideal self)


== development ==

researchers debate over when self-concept development begins. some assert that gender stereotypes and expectations set by parents for their children affect children's understanding of themselves by approximately age 3. however, at this developmental stage, children have a very broad sense of self, typically, they use words such as big or nice to describe themselves to others. while this represents the beginnings of self-concept, others suggest that self-concept develops later, around age 7 or 8.  at this point, children are developmentally prepared to interpret their own feelings and abilities, as well as receive and consider feedback from peers, teachers, and family. in adolescence, the self-concept undergoes a significant time of change. generally, self-concept changes more gradually, and instead, existing concepts are refined and solidified. however, the development of self-concept during adolescence shows a ""u""-shaped curve, in which general self-concept decreases in early adolescence, followed by an increase in later adolescence.additionally, teens begin to evaluate their abilities on a continuum, as opposed to the ""yes/no"" evaluation of children. for example, while children might evaluate themselves ""smart"", teens might evaluate themselves as ""not the smartest, but smarter than average."" despite differing opinions about the onset of self-concept development, researchers agree on the importance of one's self-concept, which influences people's behaviors and cognitive and emotional outcomes including (but not limited to) academic achievement, levels of happiness, anxiety, social integration, self-esteem, and life-satisfaction.


=== academic ===
academic self-concept refers to the personal beliefs about their academic abilities or skills. some research suggests that it begins developing from ages 3 to 5 due to influence from parents and early educators. by age 10 or 11, children assess their academic abilities by comparing themselves to their peers. these social comparisons are also referred to as self-estimates. self-estimates of cognitive ability are most accurate when evaluating subjects that deal with numbers, such as math. self-estimates were more likely to be poor in other areas, such as reasoning speed.some researchers suggest that to raise academic self-concept, parents and teachers need to provide children with specific feedback that focuses on their particular skills or abilities. others also state that learning opportunities should be conducted in groups (both mixed-ability and like-ability) that downplay social comparison, as too much of either type of grouping can have adverse effects on children's academic self-concept and the way they view themselves in relation to their peers.


=== physical ===
physical self-concept is the individual's perception of themselves in areas of physical ability and appearance. physical ability includes concepts such as physical strength and endurance, while appearance refers to attractiveness. adolescents experience significant changes in general physical self-concept at the on-set of puberty, about 11 years old for girls and about 15 years old for boys. the bodily changes during puberty, in conjunction with the various psychological of this period, makes adolescence especially significant for the development of physical self-concept. an important factor of physical self-concept development is participation in physical activities. it has even been suggested that adolescent involvement in competitive sports increases physical self-concept.


=== gender identity ===
a person's gender identity is a sense of ones own gender however variously defined and expressed across diverse cultures. these ideas are typically formed in young children. according to the international encyclopedia of marriage and family, gender identity is developed at an early age when the child starts to communicate; by the age of eighteen months to two years is when the child begins to identify as a girl or a boy. after this stage, some consider gender identity already formed although some consider non-gendered identities and kohlberg noted gender constancy where by the age of five to six, a child becomes well-aware of their gender identity. both biological and social factors may influence identities such as a sense of individuality, identities of place as well as gendered identities.  as part of environmental attitudes, some suggest women more than men care about the environment. forms of gender stereotyping is also important to consider in clinical settings.  for example, a study at kuwait university with a small sample of 102 men with so-called 'gender identity disorder' examined self-concept, masculinity and femininity. findings were that children who grew up on lower family bonds had lower self-concept. clearly, it is important to consider the context of social and political attitudes and beliefs before drawing any conclusions about gender identities in relation to personality, particularly about mental health and issues around acceptable behaviours.


== cultural differences ==
worldviews about one's self in relation to others differ across and within cultures. western cultures place particular importance on personal independence and on the expression of one's own attributes (i.e. the self is more important than the group). this is not to say those in an independent culture do not identify and support their society or culture, there is simply a different type of relationship. non-western cultures favor an interdependent view of the self: interpersonal relationships are more important than one's individual accomplishments, and individuals experience a sense of oneness with the group. such identity fusion can have positive and negative consequences. identity fusion can give people the sense that their existence is meaningful provided the person feels included within the society (for example, in japan, the definition of the word for self (jibun) roughly translates to ""one's share of the shared life space""). identity fusion can also harm one's self-concept because one's behaviors and thoughts must be able to change to continue to align with those of the overall group. non-interdependent self-concepts can also differ between cultural traditions.additionally, one's social norms and cultural identities have a large effect on self-concept and mental well-being. when a person can clearly define their culture's norms and how those play a part in their life, that person is more likely to have a positive self-identity, leading to better self-concept and psychological welfare. one example of this is in regards to consistency.  one of the social norms within a western, independent culture is consistency, which allows each person to maintain their self-concept over time. the social norm in a non-western, interdependent culture has a larger focus on one's ability to be flexible and to change as the group and environment change. if this social norm is not followed in either culture, this can lead to a disconnection with one's social identity, which affects personality, behavior, and overall self-concept. buddhists emphasize the impermanence of any self-concept.anit somech, an organizational psychologist and professor, who carried a small study in israel showed that the divide between independent and interdependent self-concepts exists within cultures as well. researchers compared mid-level merchants in an urban community with those in a kibbutz (collective community). the managers from the urban community followed the independent culture. when asked to describe themselves, they primarily used descriptions of their own personal traits without comparison to others within their group. when the independent, urban managers gave interdependent-type responses, most were focused on work or school, due to these being the two biggest groups identified within an independent culture. the kibbutz managers followed the interdependent culture. they used hobbies and preferences to describe their traits, which is more frequently seen in interdependent cultures as these serve as a means of comparison with others in their society.  there was also a large focus on residence, lending to the fact they share resources and living space with the others from the kibbutz. these types of differences were also seen in a study done with swedish and japanese adolescents. typically, these would both be considered non-western cultures, but the swedish showed more independent traits, while the japanese followed the expected interdependent traits.along with viewing one's identity as part of a group, another factor that coincides with self-concept is stereotype threat. many working names have been used for this term: ""stigmatization"", ""stigma pressure"", ""stigma vulnerability"" and ""stereotype vulnerability"". the terminology that was settled upon claude steele and joshua aronson to describe this ""situational predicament was 'stereotype threat.' this term captures the idea of a situational predicament as a contingency of their [marginalized] group identity, a real threat of judgment or treatment in the person's environment that went beyond any limitations within."" steele and aronson described the idea of stereotype threat in their study of how this socio‐psychological notion affected the intellectual performance of african americans. steele and aronson tested a hypothesis by administering a diagnostic exam between two different groups: african american and white students. for one group a stereotype threat was introduced while the other served as a control. the findings were that academic performance of the african american students was significantly lower than their white counterparts when a stereotype threat was perceived after controlling for intellectual ability. since the inception by steele and aronson of stereotype threat, other research has demonstrated the applicability of this idea to other groups.when one's actions could negatively influence general assumptions of a stereotype, those actions are consciously emphasized. instead of one's individual characteristics, one's categorization into a social group is what society views objectively - which could be perceived as a negative stereotype, thus creating a threat.  ""the notion that stereotypes held about a particular group may create psychologically threatening situations associated with fears of confirming judgment about one's group, and in turn, inhibit learning and performance.""the same prejudice that exists in stereotype threat also exists in the education system as it serves its communities, families, and individuals. these discriminatory practices in schools are the center of various educational and psychological researches. the research aims to increase equity in the classroom as well as academic achievement among students in minority groups.the presence of stereotype threat perpetuates a ""hidden curriculum"" that further marginalized minority groups. hidden curriculum refers to a covert expression of prejudice where one standard is accepted as the ""set and right way to do things"". more specifically, the hidden curriculum is an unintended transmission of social constructs that operate in the social environment of an educational setting or classroom. in the united states' educational system, this caters to dominant culture groups in american society. ""a primary source of stereotyping is often the teachers education program itself. it is in these programs that teachers learn that poor students and students of color should be expected to achieve less than their 'mainstream' counterparts."" these child-deficit assumptions that are built into the program that instructs teachers and lead to inadvertently testing all students on a ""mainstream"" standard that is not necessarily academic and that does not account for the social values and norms of non-""mainstream"" students.for example, the model of ""teacher as the formal authority"" is the orthodox teaching role that has been perpetuated for many years until the 21st-century teaching model landed on the scene. as part of the 5 main teaching style proposed by anthony grasha, a cognitive and social psychologist until his death in 2003, the authoritarian style is described as believing that there are ""correct, acceptable, and standard ways to do things"". this system has dominated for as long as the educational system in america has, however, believing that there is a ""set and acceptable way to do things"" has in the past and can now perpetuate a ""hidden curriculum"" that is a form of institutionalized racism against marginalized groups such as mexican americans, asian americans, african americans, and students with learning disabilities. this opens up a pathway for deficit thinking to rule and where a growth mindset is diminished.


== gender issues ==
in some cultures, involvement in social interactions and relationships is also stereotyped by gender. some say, girls tend to prefer one-on-one (dyadic) interaction, forming tight, intimate bonds, while boys prefer group activities. one study in particular found that boys performed almost twice as well in groups than in pairs, whereas girls did not show such a difference. in early adolescence, the variations in physical self-concepts appear slightly stronger for boys than girls. this includes self-concepts about movement, body, appearance and other physical attributes. yet during periods of physical change such as infancy, adolescence and ageing, it is particularly useful to compare these self-concepts with measured skills before drawing broad conclusions some studies suggest self-concept of social behaviours are substantially similar with specific variations for girls and boys. for instance,  girls are more likely than boys to wait their turn to speak, agree with others, and acknowledge the contributions of others. it seems boys see themselves as building larger group relationships based on shared interests, threaten, boast, and call names. in mixed-sex pairs of children aged 33 months, girls were more likely to passively watch a boy play, and boys were more likely to be unresponsive to what the girls were saying. in some cultures, such stereotypical traits are sustained from childhood to adulthood suggesting a strong influence of expectations by other people in these cultures.  the key impacts of social self-concepts on social behaviours and of social behaviours on social self-concepts is a vital area of ongoing research.
in contrast, research suggest overall similarities for gender groups in self-concepts about academic work. in general, any variations are systematically gender-based yet small in terms of effect sizes.  any variations suggest overall academic self-concept are slightly stronger for men than women in mathematics, science and technology and slightly stronger for women than men about language related skills. it is important to observe there is no link between self concepts and skills [i.e., correlations about r = 0.19 are rather weak if statistically significant with large samples]. clearly, even small variations in perceived self-concepts tend to reflect gender stereotypes evident in some cultures . in recent years, more women have been entering into the stem field, working in predominantly mathematics, technology and science related careers. many factors play a role in variations in gender effects on self-concept to accumulate as attitudes to mathematics and science; in particular, the impact other people's expectations rather than role-models on our self-concepts . 


== media ==
a commonly-asked question is ""why do people choose one form of media over another?"" according to the galileo model, there are different forms of media spread throughout three-dimensional space. the closer one form of media is to another the more similar the source of media is to each other. the farther away from each form of media is in space, the least similar the source of media is. for example, mobile and cell phone are located closest in space where as newspaper and texting are farthest apart in space. the study further explained the relationship between self-concept and the use of different forms of media. the more hours per day an individual uses a form of media, the closer that form of media is to their self-concept.
self-concept is related to the form of media most used. if one considers onself tech savvy, then one will use mobile phones more often than one would use a newspaper. if one considers oneself old fashioned, then one will use a magazine more often than one would instant message.
in this day and age, social media is where people experience most of their communication. with developing a sense of self on a psychological level, feeling as part of a greater body such as social, emotional, political bodies can affect how one feels about themselves. if a person is included or excluded from a group, that can affect how they form their identities. growing social media is a place for not only expressing an already formed identity, but to explore and experiment with developing identities. in the united kingdom, a study about changing identities revealed that some people believe that partaking in online social media is the first time they have felt like themselves, and they have achieved their true identities. they also revealed that these online identities transferred to their offline identities.a 2007 study was done on adolescents aged 12 to 18 to view the ways in which social media affects the formation of an identity. the study found that it affected the formation in three different ways: risk taking, communication of personal views, and perceptions of influences. in this particular study, risk taking behavior was engaging with strangers. when it came to communication about personal views, half of the participants reported that it was easier to express these opinions online, because they felt an enhanced ability to be creative and meaningful. when it came to other's opinions, one subject reported finding out more about themselves, like openness to experience, because of receiving differing opinions on things such as relationships.

pentasaccharide derivative,reagent,"xanthan gum () is a polysaccharide with many industrial uses, including as a common food additive. it is an effective thickening agent and stabilizer to prevent ingredients from separating. it can be produced from simple sugars using a fermentation process, and derives its name from the species of bacteria used, xanthomonas campestris.


== history ==
xanthan gum was discovered by allene rosalind jeanes and her research team at the united states department of agriculture, and brought into commercial production by cp kelco under the trade name kelzan in the early 1960s. it was approved for use in foods in 1968 and is accepted as a safe food additive in the usa, canada, european countries, and many other countries, with e number e415, and cas number 11138-66-2.
xanthan gum derives its name from the species of bacteria used during the fermentation process, xanthomonas campestris. this is the same bacterium responsible for causing black rot to form on broccoli, cauliflower, and other leafy vegetables.


== uses ==
xanthan gum, 1%, can produce a significant increase in the viscosity of a liquid.in foods, xanthan gum is common in salad dressings and sauces.  it helps to prevent oil separation by stabilizing the emulsion, although it is not an emulsifier.  xanthan gum also helps suspend solid particles, such as spices. xanthan gum helps create the desired texture in many ice creams. toothpaste often contains xanthan gum as a binder to keep the product uniform. xanthan gum also helps thicken commercial egg substitutes made from egg whites, to replace the fat and emulsifiers found in yolks. it is also a preferred method of thickening liquids for those with swallowing disorders, since it does not change the color or flavor of foods or beverages at typical use levels. in gluten-free baking, xanthan gum is used to give the dough or batter the stickiness that would otherwise be achieved with gluten. in most foods it is used at concentrations of 0.5% or less. xanthan gum is used in wide range food products, such as sauces, dressings, meat and poultry products, bakery products, confectionery products, beverages, dairy products, others.
in the oil industry, xanthan gum is used in large quantities to thicken drilling mud. these fluids carry the solids cut by the drilling bit to the surface. xanthan gum provides great ""low end"" rheology.  when circulation stops, the solids remain suspended in the drilling fluid.  the widespread use of horizontal drilling and the demand for good control of drilled solids has led to its expanded use. it has been added to concrete poured underwater, to increase its viscosity and prevent washout.
in cosmetics, xanthan gum is used to prepare water gels. it is also used in oil-in-water emulsions to enhance droplet coalescence. xanthan gum is under preliminary research for its potential uses in tissue engineering to construct hydrogels and scaffolds supporting three-dimensional tissue formation.


=== shear thinning ===
the viscosity of xanthan gum solutions decreases with higher shear rates. this is called shear thinning or pseudoplasticity.  this means that a product subjected to shear, whether from mixing, shaking or chewing will thin. when the shear forces are removed, the food will thicken again. in salad dressing, the addition of xanthan gum makes it thick enough at rest in the bottle to keep the mixture fairly homogeneous, but the shear forces generated by shaking and pouring thins it, so it can be easily poured. when it exits the bottle, the shear forces are removed and it thickens again, so it clings to the salad.


=== amounts used ===
the greater the ratio of xanthan gum added to a liquid, the thicker the liquid will become. an emulsion can be formed with as little as 0.1% (by weight). increasing the amount of gum gives a thicker, more stable emulsion up to 1% xanthan gum. a teaspoon of xanthan gum weighs about 2.5 grams and brings one cup (250 ml) of water to a 1% concentration.to make a foam, 0.2–0.8% xanthan gum is typically used. larger amounts result in larger bubbles and denser foam. egg white powder (0.2–2.0%) with 0.1–0.4% xanthan gum yields bubbles similar to soap bubbles.


== health ==
evaluation of workers exposed to xanthan gum dust found evidence of a link to respiratory symptoms.on may 20, 2011, the fda issued a press release about simplythick, a food-thickening additive containing xanthan gum as the active ingredient, warning parents, caregivers, and health care providers not to feed simplythick, a thickening product, to premature infants. the concern is that the product may cause premature infants to suffer necrotizing enterocolitis.


=== safety ===
according to a 2017 safety review by a scientific panel of the european food safety authority (efsa), xanthan gum (european food additive number e 415) is extensively digested during intestinal fermentation, and causes no adverse effects, even at high intake amounts. the efsa panel found no concern about genotoxicity from long-term consumption. the efsa concluded that there is no safety concern for the general population when xanthan gum is consumed as a food additive.


== preparation ==
xanthan gum is produced by the fermentation of glucose and sucrose. the polysaccharide is prepared by the bacteria being inoculated into a sterile aqueous solution of carbohydrate(s), a source of nitrogen, dipotassium phosphate, and some trace elements. the medium is well-aerated and stirred, and the xanthan polymer is produced extracellularly into the medium. after one to four days, the polymer is precipitated from the medium by the addition of isopropyl alcohol, and the precipitate is dried and milled to give a powder that is readily soluble in water or brine.it is composed of pentasaccharide repeat units, comprising glucose, mannose, and glucuronic acid in the molar ratio 2:2:1.a strain of x. campestris has been developed that will grow on lactose - which allows it to be used to process whey, a waste product of cheese production. this can produce 30 g/l of xanthan gum for every 40 g/l of whey powder. whey-derived xanthan gum is commonly used in many commercial products, such as shampoos and salad dressings.


=== detail of the biosynthesis ===
synthesis originates from glucose as substrate for synthesis of the sugar nucleotides precursors udp-glucose, udp-glucuronate, and gdp-mannose that are required for building the pentasaccharide repeat unit. this links the synthesis of xanthan to carbohydrate metabolism. the repeat units are built up at undecaprenylphosphate lipid carriers that are anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane.specific glycosyltransferases sequentially transfer the sugar moieties of the nucleotide sugar xanthan precursors to the lipid carriers. acetyl and pyruvyl residues are added as non-carbohydrate decorations. mature repeat units are polymerized and exported in a way resembling the wzy-dependent polysaccharide synthesis mechanism of enterobacteriaceae. products of the gum gene cluster drive synthesis, polymerization, and export of the repeat unit.


== references =="
oxime o-ether,reagent,"ethers are a class of organic compounds that contain an ether group—an oxygen atom connected to two alkyl or aryl groups.  they have the general formula r–o–r′, where r and r′ represent the alkyl or aryl groups. ethers can again be classified into two varieties: if the alkyl groups are the same on both sides of the oxygen atom, then it is a simple or symmetrical ether, whereas if they are different, the ethers are called mixed or unsymmetrical ethers. a typical example of the first group is the solvent and anesthetic diethyl ether, commonly referred to simply as ""ether"" (ch3–ch2–o–ch2–ch3). ethers are common in organic chemistry and even more prevalent in biochemistry, as they are common linkages in carbohydrates and lignin.


== structure and bonding ==
ethers feature bent c–o–c linkages.  in dimethyl ether, the bond angle is 111° and c–o distances are 141 pm. the barrier to rotation about the c–o bonds is low.  the bonding of oxygen in ethers, alcohols, and water is similar. in the language of valence bond theory, the hybridization at oxygen is sp3.
oxygen is more electronegative than carbon, thus the hydrogens alpha to ethers are more acidic than in simple hydrocarbons. they are far less acidic than hydrogens alpha to carbonyl groups (such as in ketones or aldehydes), however.
ethers can be symmetrical of the type ror or unsymmetrical of the type ror'.  examples of the former are diethyl ether, dimethyl ether, dipropyl ether etc.  illustrative unsymmetrical ethers are anisole (methoxybenzene) and dimethoxyethane.


== nomenclature ==
in the iupac nomenclature system, ethers are named using the general formula ""alkoxyalkane"", for example ch3–ch2–o–ch3 is methoxyethane. if the ether is part of a more-complex molecule, it is described as an alkoxy substituent, so –och3 would be considered a ""methoxy-"" group. the simpler alkyl radical is written in front, so ch3–o–ch2ch3 would be given as methoxy(ch3o)ethane(ch2ch3).


=== trivial name ===
iupac rules are often not followed for simple ethers. the trivial names for simple ethers (i.e., those with none or few other functional groups) are a composite of the two substituents followed by ""ether"".  for example, ethyl methyl ether (ch3oc2h5), diphenylether (c6h5oc6h5). as for other organic compounds, very common ethers acquired names before rules for nomenclature were formalized. diethyl ether is simply called ""ether"", but was once called sweet oil of vitriol. methyl phenyl ether is anisole, because it was originally found in aniseed. the aromatic ethers include furans. acetals (α-alkoxy ethers r–ch(–or)–o–r) are another class of ethers with characteristic properties.


=== polyethers ===
polyethers are generally polymers containing ether linkages in their main chain. the term glycol generally refers to polyether polyols with one or more functional end-groups such as a hydroxyl group. the term ""oxide"" or other terms are used for high molar mass polymer when end-groups no longer affect polymer properties.
crown ethers are cyclic polyethers. some toxins produced by dinoflagellates such as brevetoxin and ciguatoxin are extremely large and are known as cyclic or ladder polyethers.

the phenyl ether polymers are a class of aromatic polyethers containing aromatic cycles in their main chain: polyphenyl ether (ppe) and poly(p-phenylene oxide) (ppo).


=== related compounds ===
many classes of compounds with c–o–c linkages are not considered ethers: esters (r–c(=o)–o–r′), hemiacetals (r–ch(–oh)–o–r′), carboxylic acid anhydrides (rc(=o)–o–c(=o)r′).


== physical properties ==
ethers have boiling points similar to those of the analogous alkanes.  simple ethers are generally colorless.


== reactions ==

the c-o bonds that comprise simple ethers are strong.  they are unreactive toward all but the strongest bases. although generally of low chemical reactivity, they are more reactive than alkanes. 
specialized ethers such as epoxides, ketals, and acetals are unrepresentative classes of ethers and are discussed in separate articles.  important reactions are listed below.


=== cleavage ===

although ethers resist hydrolysis, they are cleaved by hydrobromic acid and hydroiodic acid. hydrogen chloride cleaves ethers only slowly. methyl ethers typically afford methyl halides:

roch3  +  hbr   →   ch3br  +  rohthese reactions proceed via onium intermediates, i.e. [ro(h)ch3]+br−.
some ethers undergo rapid cleavage with boron tribromide (even aluminium chloride is used in some cases) to give the alkyl bromide. depending on the substituents, some ethers can be cleaved with a variety of reagents, e.g. strong base.


=== peroxide formation ===
when stored in the presence of air or oxygen, ethers tend to form explosive peroxides, such as diethyl ether hydroperoxide. the reaction is accelerated by light, metal catalysts, and aldehydes. in addition to avoiding storage conditions likely to form peroxides, it is recommended, when an ether is used as a solvent, not to distill it to dryness, as any peroxides that may have formed, being less volatile than the original ether, will become concentrated in the last few drops of liquid.  the presence of peroxide in old samples of ethers may be detected by shaking them with freshly prepared solution of a ferrous sulfate followed by addition of kscn.  appearance of blood red color indicates presence of peroxides.  the dangerous properties of ether peroxides are the reason that diethyl ether and other peroxide forming ethers like tetrahydrofuran (thf) or ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (1,2-dimethoxyethane) are avoided in industrial processes.


=== lewis bases ===

ethers serve as lewis bases. for instance, diethyl ether forms a complex with boron trifluoride, i.e. diethyl etherate (bf3·oet2). ethers also coordinate to the mg center in grignard reagents.  the cyclic ether thf is more basic than acyclic ethers.  it forms complexes with many metal halides.


=== alpha-halogenation ===
this reactivity is similar to the tendency of ethers with alpha hydrogen atoms to form peroxides. reaction with chlorine produces alpha-chloroethers.


== synthesis ==
ethers can be prepared by numerous routes. in general alkyl ethers form more readily than aryl ethers, with the later species often requiring metal catalysts.the synthesis of diethyl ether by a reaction between ethanol and sulfuric acid has been known since the 13th century.


=== dehydration of alcohols ===
the dehydration of alcohols affords ethers:
2 r–oh → r–o–r + h2o at high temperature
this direct nucleophilic substitution reaction requires elevated temperatures (about 125 °c). the reaction is catalyzed by acids, usually sulfuric acid. the method is effective for generating symmetrical ethers, but not unsymmetrical ethers, since either oh can be protonated, which would give a mixture of products. diethyl ether is produced from ethanol by this method. cyclic ethers are readily generated by this approach. elimination reactions compete with dehydration of the alcohol:

r–ch2–ch2(oh) → r–ch=ch2 + h2othe dehydration route often requires conditions incompatible with delicate molecules. several milder methods exist to produce ethers.


=== williamson ether synthesis ===
nucleophilic displacement of alkyl halides by alkoxides

r–ona + r′–x   →   r–o–r′ + naxthis reaction is called the williamson ether synthesis. it involves treatment of a parent alcohol with a strong base to form the alkoxide, followed by addition of an appropriate aliphatic compound bearing a suitable leaving group (r–x). suitable leaving groups (x) include iodide, bromide, or sulfonates. this method usually does not work well for aryl halides (e.g. bromobenzene, see ullmann condensation below). likewise, this method only gives the best yields for primary halides. secondary and tertiary halides are prone to undergo e2 elimination on exposure to the basic alkoxide anion used in the reaction due to steric hindrance from the large alkyl groups.
in a related reaction, alkyl halides undergo nucleophilic displacement by phenoxides. the r–x cannot be used to react with the alcohol. however phenols can be used to replace the alcohol while maintaining the alkyl halide. since phenols are acidic, they readily react with a strong base like sodium hydroxide to form phenoxide ions. the phenoxide ion will then substitute the –x group in the alkyl halide, forming an ether with an aryl group attached to it in a reaction with an sn2 mechanism.

c6h5oh + oh− → c6h5–o−  +  h2oc6h5–o− + r–x   →   c6h5or


=== ullmann condensation ===
the ullmann condensation is similar to the williamson method except that the substrate is an aryl halide.  such reactions generally require a catalyst, such as copper.


=== electrophilic addition of alcohols to alkenes ===
alcohols add to electrophilically activated alkenes.

r2c=cr2 + r–oh → r2ch–c(–o–r)–r2acid catalysis is required for this reaction. often, mercury trifluoroacetate (hg(ococf3)2) is used as a catalyst for the reaction generating an ether with markovnikov regiochemistry.  using similar reactions, tetrahydropyranyl ethers are used as protective groups for alcohols.


=== preparation of epoxides ===

epoxides are typically prepared by oxidation of alkenes.  the most important epoxide in terms of industrial scale is ethylene oxide, which is produced by oxidation of ethylene with oxygen.  other epoxides are produced by one of two routes:

by the oxidation of alkenes with a peroxyacid such as m-cpba.
by the base intramolecular nucleophilic substitution of a halohydrin.

"rabies virus vaccine wistar strain pm-1503-3m (human), inactivated injection",drug,"the rabies vaccine is a vaccine used to prevent rabies. there are a number of rabies vaccines available that are both safe and effective. they can be used to prevent rabies before, and for a period of time after, exposure to the rabies virus, which is commonly caused by a dog bite or a bat bite.doses are usually given by injection into the skin or muscle. after exposure, the vaccination is typically used along with rabies immunoglobulin. it is recommended that those who are at high risk of exposure be vaccinated before potential exposure. rabies vaccines are effective in humans and other animals, and vaccinating dogs is very effective in preventing the spread of rabies to humans. a long-lasting immunity to the virus develops after a full course of treatment.rabies vaccines may be used safely by all age groups. about 35 to 45 percent of people develop a brief period of redness and pain at the injection site, and 5 to 15 percent of people may experience fever, headaches, or nausea. after exposure to rabies there is no contraindication to its use, since the untreated virus is always fatal. most rabies vaccines do not contain thimerosal.the first rabies vaccine was introduced in 1885 and was followed by an improved version in 1908. millions of people globally are vaccinated against the virus. it is on the world health organization's list of essential medicines.


== medical uses ==


=== before exposure ===
the world health organization (who) recommends vaccinating those who are at high risk of the disease, such as children who live in areas where it is common. other groups may include veterinarians, researchers, or people planning to travel to regions where rabies is common. three doses of the vaccine are given over a one-month period on days zero, seven, and either twenty-one or twenty-eight.


=== after exposure ===
for individuals who have been potentially exposed to the virus, four doses over two weeks are recommended, as well as an injection of rabies immunoglobulin with the first dose. this is known as post-exposure vaccination. for people who have previously been vaccinated, only a single dose of the rabies vaccine is required. however, vaccination after exposure is neither a treatment nor a cure for rabies; it can only prevent the development of rabies in a person if given before the virus reaches the brain.  because the rabies virus has a relatively long incubation period, post-exposure vaccinations are typically highly effective.


=== additional doses ===
immunity following a course of doses is typically long lasting, and additional doses are usually not needed unless the person has a high risk of contracting the virus. those at risk may have tests done to measure the amount of rabies antibodies in the blood, and then get rabies boosters as needed. following administration of a booster dose, one study found 97% of immunocompetent individuals demonstrated protective levels of neutralizing antibodies after ten years.


== safety ==
rabies vaccines are safe in all age groups. about 35 to 45 percent of people develop a brief period of redness and pain at the injection site, and 5 to 15 percent of people may experience fever, headaches, or nausea. because of the certain fatality of the virus, receiving the vaccine is always advisable.most rabies vaccines do not contain thimerosal. vaccines made from nerve tissue are used in a few countries, mainly in asia and latin america, but are less effective and have greater side effects. their use is thus not recommended by the world health organization.


== types ==
the human diploid cell rabies vaccine (h.d.c.v.) was started in 1967. human diploid cell rabies vaccines are inactivated vaccines made using the attenuated pitman-moore l503 strain of the virus.in addition to these developments, newer and less expensive purified chicken embryo cell vaccines (cceev) and purified vero cell rabies vaccines are now available and are recommended for use by the who.   the purified vero cell rabies vaccine uses the attenuated wistar strain of the rabies virus, and uses the vero cell line as its host.  cceevs can be used in both pre- and post-exposure vaccinations.  cceevs use inactivated rabies virus grown from either embryonated eggs or in cell cultures and are safe for use in humans and animals.


== history ==
virtually all infections with rabies resulted in death until two french scientists, louis pasteur and émile roux, developed the first rabies vaccination in 1885. nine-year-old joseph meister (1876–1940), who had been mauled by a rabid dog, was the first human to receive this vaccine. the treatment started with a subcutaneous injection on 6 july 1885, at 8:00 pm, which was followed with 12 additional doses administered over the following 10 days. the first injection was derived from the spinal cord of an inoculated rabbit which had died of rabies 15 days earlier. all the doses were obtained by attenuation, but later ones were progressively more virulent.the pasteur-roux vaccine attenuated the harvested virus samples by allowing them to dry for five to ten days. similar nerve tissue-derived vaccines are still used in some countries, and while they are much cheaper than modern cell culture vaccines, they are not as effective. neural tissue vaccines also carry a certain risk of neurological complications.


== cost ==
when the modern cell-culture rabies vaccine was first introduced in the early 1980s, it cost $45 per dose was considered to be too expensive.  the cost of the rabies vaccine continues to be a limitation to acquiring pre-exposure rabies immunization for travellers from developed countries. in 2015 in the united states, a course of three doses could cost over $1,000, while in europe a course costs around €100. it is possible and more cost-effective to split one intramuscular dose of the vaccine into several intradermal doses, but this practice is discouraged by american health authorities.


== veterinary use ==

pre-exposure immunization has been used on domesticated and wild populations. in many jurisdictions, domestic dogs, cats, ferrets, and rabbits are required to be vaccinated.


=== dogs ===
aside from vaccinating humans, another approach was also developed by vaccinating dogs to prevent the spread of the virus. in 1979, the van houweling research laboratory of the silliman university medical center in dumaguete in the philippines developed and produced a dog vaccine that gave a three-year immunity from rabies. the development of the vaccine resulted in the elimination of rabies in many parts of the visayas and mindanao islands. the successful program in the philippines was later used as a model by other countries, such as ecuador and the yucatan state of mexico, in their fight against rabies conducted in collaboration with the world health organization.in tunisia a rabies control program was initiated to give dog owners free vaccination to promote mass vaccination which was sponsored by their government. the vaccine is known as rabisin (mérial), which is a cell based rabies vaccine only used countrywide. vaccinations are often administered when owners take in their dogs for check-ups and visits at the vet.


=== wild animals ===
wildlife species, primarily bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes, act as reservoir species for different variants of the rabies virus. this results in the general occurrence of rabies as well as outbreaks in animal populations.  approximately 90% of all reported rabies cases in the us are from wildlife.


==== oral rabies vaccine ====
there is an oral vaccination in pellet form which can be left out for wild animals to produce a herd immunity effect. oral rabies vaccination (orv) programs have been used in many countries in an effort to control the spread of rabies and limit the risk of human contact with the rabies virus. orv programs were initiated in europe in the 1980s, canada in 1985, and in the united states in 1990. orv is a preventive measure to eradicate rabies in wild animal vectors of disease, mainly foxes, raccoons, raccoon dogs, coyotes and jackals, but also can be used for dogs in developing countries. orv programs typically use edible baits to deliver the vaccine to targeted animals. orv baits consist of a small packet containing the oral vaccine which is then either coated in a fishmeal paste or encased in a fishmeal-polymer block. when an animal bites into the bait, the packets burst and the vaccine is administered.  current research suggests that if adequate amounts of the vaccine is ingested, immunity to the virus should last for upwards of one year.  by immunizing wild or stray animals, orv programs work to create a buffer zone between the rabies virus and potential contact with humans, pets, or livestock.  the effectiveness of orv campaigns in specific areas is determined through trap-and-release methods. titer tests are performed on the blood drawn from the sample animals in order to measure rabies antibody levels in the blood.  baits are usually distributed by aircraft to more efficiently cover large, rural regions.  in order to place baits more precisely and to minimize human and pet contact with baits, however, they are distributed by hand in suburban or urban regions. the potential for human contact with baits is a present concern for  opv programs, but the oral vaccine does not contain the whole rabies virus and has been proven safe in over 60 animal species including cats and dogs. the idea of wildlife vaccination was conceived during the 1960s, and modified-live rabies viruses were used for the experimental oral vaccination of carnivores by the 1970s. the development of safe and effective rabies virus vaccines applied in attractive baits resulted in the first field trials in switzerland in 1978 to immunize red foxes. orv programs have seen success in preventing the westward spread of raccoon variant rabies in the united states and even eradicating rabies in red foxes in switzerland.imrab is an example of a veterinary rabies vaccine containing the pasteur strain of killed rabies virus. several different types of imrab exist, including imrab, imrab 3, and imrab large animal. imrab 3 has been approved for ferrets and, in some areas, pet skunks. the reason why these oral vaccines that enter the body through the gi tract are able to convey resistance to rabies is due to the usage of a live human adenovirus type 5 vector. adenovirus, a common viral pathogen that infects the gi tract and causes diarrhea is genetically altered to express rabies surface proteins, thereby allowing the adenovirus to infect gi tract cells. this enables the viral vector to infect cells in the gi and stimulate a cellular and humoral response that would provide immunity in the case of being bitten by an infected animal and being infected via blood.

asfotase alfa injection,drug,"asfotase alfa, sold under the brand name strensiq, is a medication used in the treatment of people with perinatal/infantile- and juvenile-onset hypophosphatasia.the most common side effects include injection site reactions, hypersensitivity reactions (such as difficulty breathing, nausea, dizziness and fever), lipodystrophy (a loss of fat tissue resulting in an indentation in the skin or a thickening of fat tissue resulting in a lump under the skin) at the injection site, and ectopic calcifications of the eyes and kidney.the enzyme tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (alp) plays a key role in creating and maintaining healthy bones, and managing calcium and phosphate in the body. people with hypophosphatasia cannot make enough working alp, which leads to weak bones. asfotase alfa is a version of the human alp enzyme and serves as a replacement, thereby increasing levels of working alp.


== medical uses ==
in the united states, asfotase alfa is indicated for the treatment of people with perinatal/infantile- and juvenile-onset hypophosphatasia (hpp).in the european union, asfotase alfa is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in people with paediatric-onset hypophosphatasia to treat the bone manifestations of the disease.


== adverse effects ==
the most common adverse effects in studies included injection site reactions (pain, itching, erythema, etc.), headache, limb pain, and haematoma. possible rare side effects could not be assessed because of the low number of patients.


== interactions ==
asfotase alfa interferes with alkaline phosphatase measurements. as asfotase alfa is a glycoprotein (as opposed to a small molecule), no relevant interactions via the cytochrome p450 liver enzymes are expected.


== pharmacology ==


=== mechanism of action ===
hypophosphatasia is caused by a genetic defect of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (tnsalp), an enzyme that plays a role in bone mineralization. asfotase alfa is a recombinant glycoprotein that contains the catalytic domain (the active site) of tnsalp. it is thus a form of enzyme replacement therapy.


=== pharmacokinetics ===
after subcutaneous injection, asfotase alfa has a bioavailability of 46–98% and reaches highest blood plasma concentrations after 24 to 48 hours. elimination half life is five days.


== chemistry ==
the peptide part of the glycoprotein asfotase alfa consists of two identical chains of 726 amino acids each, containing (1) the catalytic domain of tnsalp, (2) the fc region of human immunoglobulin g1, and (3) a sequence of ten l-aspartate residues at the carboxy terminus. the two chains are linked by two disulfide bridges. each chain also contains four internal disulfide bridges.the complete peptide sequence of one chain is

asfotase alfa is produced in chinese hamster ovary cells.


== history ==
asfotase alfa was granted orphan drug designation by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) in september 2008.asfotase alfa is manufactured by alexion pharmaceuticals and it was granted breakthrough therapy designation by the u.s. fda in 2015 as it is the first and only treatment for perinatal, infantile and juvenile-onset hpp. it was approved in october 2015, in the u.s. and in august 2015, in the eu.the safety and efficacy of asfotase alfa were established in 99 participants with perinatal (disease occurs in utero and is evident at birth), infantile- or juvenile-onset hpp who received treatment for up to 6.5 years during four prospective, open-label studies. study results showed that participants with perinatal- and infantile-onset hpp treated with asfotase alfa had improved overall survival and survival without the need for a ventilator (ventilator-free survival). ninety-seven percent of treated participants were alive at one year of age compared to 42 percent of control participants selected from a natural history study group. similarly, the ventilator-free survival rate at one year of age was 85 percent for treated participants compared to less than 50 percent for the natural history control participants.participants with juvenile-onset hpp treated with asfotase alfa showed improvements in growth and bone health compared to control participants selected from a natural history database. all treated participants had improvement in low weight or short stature or maintained normal height and weight. in comparison, approximately 20 percent of control participants had growth delays over time, with shifts in height or weight from the normal range for children their age to heights and weights well below normal for age. juvenile-onset participants also showed improvements in bone mineralization, as measured on a scale that evaluates the severity of rickets and other hpp-related skeletal abnormalities based on x-ray images. all treated participants demonstrated substantial healing of rickets on x-rays while some natural history control participants showed increasing signs of rickets over time.

tripartite motif-containing protein 26 (human),protein,"tripartite motif-containing 28 (trim28), also known as transcriptional intermediary factor 1β (tif1β) and kap1 (krab-associated protein-1), is a protein that in humans is encoded by the trim28 gene.


== function ==
the protein encoded by this gene mediates transcriptional control by interaction with the krüppel-associated box repression domain found in many transcription factors. the protein localizes to the nucleus and is thought to associate with specific chromatin regions. the protein is a member of the tripartite motif family. this tripartite motif includes three zinc-binding domains, a ring, a b-box type 1 and a b-box type 2, and a coiled-coil region.kap1 is a ubiquitously expressed protein involved in many critical functions including: transcriptional regulation, cellular differentiation and proliferation, dna damage repair, viral suppression, and apoptosis. its functionality is dependent upon post-translational modifications.  phosphorylation of kap1 acts as a deactivator of the protein in many of its mechanisms while sumoylation acts as an activator.


=== cellular differentiation and proliferation ===
studies have shown that deletion of kap1 in mice before gastrulation results in death (implicating it as a necessary protein for proliferation) while deletion in adult mice results in increased anxiety and stress-induced alterations in learning and memory.  kap1 has been shown to participate in the maintenance of pluripotency of embryonic stem cells and to promote and inhibit cellular differentiation of adult cell lines.  increased levels of kap1 have been found in liver, gastric, breast, lung, and prostate cancers as well, indicating that it may play an important role in tumor cell proliferation (possibly by inhibiting apoptosis).


=== transcriptional regulation ===
kap1 can regulate genomic transcription through a variety of mechanisms, many of which remain somewhat unclear.  studies have shown that kap1 can repress transcription by binding directly to the genome (which can be sufficient in and of itself) or through the induction of heterochromatin formation via the mi2α-setb1-hp1 macromolecular complex.  kap1 can also interact with histone methyltransferases and deacetylases via the c-terminal phd and bromodomain to control transcription epigenetically.


=== dna damage repair response ===
it has been shown that atm phosphorylates kap1 upon the discovery of damaged or broken dna.  phosphorylated kap1, along with many other dna damage proteins, rapidly migrate to the site of the dna damage.  its exact involvement in this pathway is somewhat unclear, but it has been implicated in triggering cell arrest, allowing for the damaged dna to be repaired.


=== apoptosis ===
kap1 forms a complex with mdm2 (a ubiquitin e3 ligase) that binds to p53.  the complex marks the bound p53 for degradation.  p53 is a known precursor of apoptosis that facilitates the synthesis of proteins necessary for cell death so its degradation results in apoptosis inhibition.


== clinical significance ==


=== role in the establishment of viral latency ===
kap1 facilitates the establishment of viral latency in certain cell types for human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) and other endogenous retroviruses
.  kap1 acts as a transcriptional corepressor of the viral genome.  the protein binds to the histones of the viral chromatin and then recruits mi2α and setb1.  setb1 is a histone methyltransferase that recruits hp1, thus inducing heterochromatin formation.  this heterochromatin formation prevents the transcription of the viral genome.  mtor has been implicated in the phosphorylation of kap1 resulting in a switch from latency to the lytic cycle.


=== manipulations and potential for future treatment ===
ataxia telangiectasia mutated (atm) is a kinase that (similar to mtor) can phosphorylate kap1 resulting in the switch from viral latency to the lytic cycle.  chloroquine (an atm) activator has been shown to result in increases in transcription of the hcmv genome.  this effect is augmented by the use of tumor necrosis factor    it has been proposed that this treatment (accompanied by antiretroviral treatment) has the potential to purge the virus from infected individuals.

norfloxacin,antibiotic,"norfloxacin, sold under the brand name noroxin among others, is an antibiotic that belongs to the class of fluoroquinolone antibiotics. it is used to treat urinary tract infections, gynecological infections, inflammation of the prostate gland, gonorrhea and bladder infection. eye drops were approved for use in children older than one year of age.norfloxacin is associated with a number of rare serious adverse reactions as well as spontaneous tendon ruptures and irreversible peripheral neuropathy. tendon problems may manifest long after therapy had been completed and in severe cases may result in lifelong disabilities.
it was patented in 1977 and approved for medical use in 1983.


== medical uses ==
the initial approval by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) in 1986 encompassed the following indications:

uncomplicated urinary tract infections (including cystitis)
complicated urinary tract infections (restricted use) 
uncomplicated urethral and cervical gonorrhea (however this indication is no longer considered to be effective by some experts due to bacterial resistance) 
prostatitis due to escherichia coli.
syphilis treatment: norfloxacin has not been shown to be effective in the treatment of syphilis.  antimicrobial agents used in high doses for short periods of time to treat gonorrhea may mask or delay the symptoms of incubating syphilis.although fluoroquinolones are sometimes used to treat typhoid and paratyphoid fever, norfloxacin had more clinical failures than the other fluoroquinolones (417 participants, 5 trials).in ophthalmology, norfloxacin licensed use is limited to the treatment of conjunctival infections caused by susceptible bacteria.norfloxacin has been restricted in the republic of ireland due to the risks of c. difficile super infections and permanent nerve as well as tendon injuries. it licensed use in acute and chronic complicated kidney infections has been withdrawn as a result.the european medicines agency, also in 2008, had recommended restricting the use of oral norfloxacin to treat urinary infections. chmp had concluded that the marketing authorizations for norfloxacin, when used in the treatment of acute or chronic complicated pyelonephritis, should be withdrawn because the benefits do not outweigh their risks in this indication. chmp stated that doctors should not prescribe oral norfloxacin for complicated pyelonephritis and should consider switching patients already taking oral norfloxacin for this type of infection to an alternative antibiotic.norfloxacin is used for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients who have a low ascites fluid protein level, impaired renal function, severe liver disease, have had a prior episode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, or esophageal variceal bleeding.note: norfloxacin may be licensed for other uses, or restricted, by the various regulatory agencies worldwide.


== contraindications ==
as noted above, under licensed use, norfloxacin is also now considered to be contraindicated for the treatment of certain sexually transmitted diseases by some experts due to bacterial resistance.norfloxacin is contraindicated in those with a history of tendonitis, tendon rupture and those with a hypersensitivity to fluoroquinolones.there are three contraindications found within the 2008 package insert:

""noroxin (norfloxacin) is contraindicated in persons with a history of hypersensitivity, tendinitis, or tendon rupture associated with the use of norfloxacin or any member of the quinolone group of antimicrobial agents.""
""quinolones, including norfloxacin, have been shown in vitro to inhibit cyp1a2. concomitant use with drugs metabolized by cyp1a2 (e.g., caffeine, clozapine, ropinirole, tacrine, theophylline, tizanidine) may result in increased substrate drug concentrations when given in usual doses. patients taking any of these drugs concomitantly with norfloxacin should be carefully monitored.""
""concomitant administration with tizanidine is contraindicated""norfloxacin is also considered to be contraindicated within the pediatric population.

pregnancynorfloxacin has been reported to rapidly cross the blood-placenta and blood-milk barrier, and is extensively distributed into the fetal tissues. for this reason norfloxacin and other fluoroquinolones are contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of spontaneous abortions and birth defects. the fluoroquinolones have also been reported as being present in the mother's milk and are passed on to the nursing child, which may increases the risk of the child suffering an adverse reaction even though the child had never been prescribed or taken any of the drugs found within this class. as safer alternatives are generally available norfloxacin is contraindicated during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. the manufacturer only recommends use of norfloxacin during pregnancy when benefit outweighs risk.
childrena 1998 retrospective survey found that numerous side effects have been recorded in reference to the unapproved use of norfloxacin in the pediatric population.
fluoroquinolones are not licensed by the fda for use in children due to the risk of fatalities as well as permanent injury to the musculoskeletal system, with two exceptions. ciprofloxacin is being licensed for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis due to escherichia coli and inhalational anthrax (post-exposure) and levofloxacin was recently licensed for the treatment of inhalational anthrax (post-exposure). however, the fluoroquinolones are licensed to treat lower respiratory infections in children with cystic fibrosis in the uk.


== adverse effects ==
in general, fluoroquinolones are well tolerated, with most side-effects being mild to moderate.  on occasion, serious adverse effects occur. common side-effects include gastrointestinal effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, as well as headache and insomnia.
the overall rate of adverse events in patients treated with fluoroquinolones is roughly similar to that seen in patients treated with other antibiotic classes. a u.s. centers for disease control study found patients treated with fluoroquinolones experienced adverse events severe enough to lead to an emergency department visit more frequently than those treated with cephalosporins or macrolides, but less frequently than those treated with penicillins, clindamycin, sulfonamides, or vancomycin.post-marketing surveillance has revealed a variety of relatively rare but serious adverse effects that are associated with all members of the fluoroquinolone antibacterial class. among these, tendon problems and exacerbation of the symptoms of the neurological disorder myasthenia gravis are the subject of ""black box"" warnings in the united states. the most severe form of tendonopathy associated with fluoroquinolone administration is tendon rupture, which in the great majority of cases involves the achilles tendon. younger people typically experience good recovery, but permanent disability is possible, and is more likely in older patients.  the overall frequency of fluoroquinolone-associated achilles tendon rupture in patients treated with ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin has been estimated at 17 per 100,000 treatments. risk is substantially elevated in the elderly and in those with recent exposure to topical or systemic corticosteroid therapy. simultaneous use of corticosteroids is present in almost one-third of quinolone-associated tendon rupture. tendon damage may manifest during, as well as up to a year after fluoroquinolone therapy has been completed.fqs prolong the qt interval by blocking voltage-gated potassium channels. prolongation of the qt interval can lead to torsades de pointes, a life-threatening arrhythmia, but in practice this appears relatively uncommon in part because the most widely prescribed fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) only minimally prolong the qt interval.clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea may occur in connection with the use of any antibacterial drug, especially those with a broad spectrum of activity such as clindamycin, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones. fluoroquinoline treatment is associated with risk that is similar to or less  than that associated with broad spectrum cephalosporins. fluoroquinoline administration may be associated with the acquisition and outgrowth of a particularly virulent clostridium strain.the u.s. prescribing information contains a warning regarding uncommon cases of peripheral neuropathy, which can be permanent. other nervous system effects include insomnia, restlessness, and rarely, seizure, convulsions, and psychosis other rare and serious adverse events have been observed with varying degrees of evidence for causation.events that may occur in acute overdose are rare, and include kidney failure and seizure. susceptible groups of patients, such as children and the elderly, are at greater risk of adverse reactions during therapeutic use.


== interactions ==
the toxicity of drugs that are metabolised by the cytochrome p450 system is enhanced by concomitant use of some quinolones. quinolones, including norfloxacin, may enhance the effects of oral anticoagulants, including warfarin or its derivatives or similar agents. when these products are administered concomitantly, prothrombin time or other suitable coagulation tests should be closely monitored. coadministration may dangerously increase coumadin warfarin activity; inr should be monitored closely.

they may also interact with the gaba a receptor and cause neurological symptoms; this effect is augmented by certain non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 
the concomitant administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) with a quinolone, including norfloxacin, may increase the risk of cns stimulation and convulsive seizures. therefore, norfloxacin should be used with caution in individuals receiving nsaids concomitantly.elevated serum levels of cyclosporine have been reported with concomitant use of cyclosporine with norfloxacin. therefore, cyclosporine serum levels should be monitored and appropriate cyclosporine dosage adjustments made when these drugs are used concomitantly.
the concomitant administration of quinolones including norfloxacin with glyburide (a sulfonylurea agent) has, on rare occasions, resulted in severe hypoglycemia. therefore, monitoring of blood glucose is recommended when these agents are co-administered.

some quinolones exert an inhibitory effect on the cytochrome p-450 system, thereby reducing theophylline clearance and increasing theophylline blood levels. coadministration of certain fluoroquinolones and other drugs primarily metabolized by cyp1a2 (e.g. theophylline, methylxanthines, tizanidine) results in increased plasma concentrations and could lead to clinically significant side effects of the coadministered drug. additionally other fluoroquinolones, especially enoxacin, and to a lesser extent ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin, also inhibit the metabolic clearance of theophylline.such drug interactions are associated with the molecular structural modifications of the quinolone ring, specifically interactions involving nsaids and theophylline.  as such, these drug interactions involving the fluoroquinolones appear to be drug specific rather than a class effect.  the fluoroquinolones have also been shown to interfere with the metabolism of caffeine and the absorption of levothyroxine. the interference with the metabolism of caffeine may lead to the reduced clearance of caffeine and a prolongation of its serum half-life, resulting in a caffeine overdose.  this may lead to reduced clearance of caffeine and a prolongation of the plasma's half-life that may lead to accumulation of caffeine in plasma when products containing caffeine are consumed while taking norfloxacin.
the use of nsaids (non steroid anti inflammatory drugs) while undergoing fluoroquinolone therapy is contra-indicated due to the risk of severe cns adverse reactions, including but not limited to seizure disorders. fluoroquinolones with an unsubstituted piperazinyl moiety at position 7 have the potential to interact with nsaids and/or their metabolites, resulting in antagonism of gaba neurotransmission.the use of norfloxacin concomitantly has also been associated with transient elevations in serum creatinine in patients receiving cyclosporine, on rare occasions, resulted in severe hypoglycemia with sulfonylurea. renal tubular transport of methotrexate may be inhibited by concomitant administration of norfloxacin, potentially leading to increased plasma levels of methotrexate. this might increase the risk of methotrexate toxic reactions.
current or past treatment with oral corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of achilles tendon rupture, especially in elderly patients who are also taking the fluoroquinolones.


== overdose ==
treatment of overdose includes emptying of the stomach via induced vomiting or by gastric lavage. careful monitoring and supportive treatment, monitoring of renal and liver function, and maintaining adequate hydration is recommended by the manufacturer. administration of magnesium, aluminum, or calcium containing antacids can reduce the absorption of norfloxacin.


== mechanism of action ==
norfloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.  it functions by inhibiting dna gyrase, a type ii topoisomerase, and topoisomerase iv, enzymes necessary to separate bacterial dna, thereby inhibiting cell division. norfloxacin does not bind to dna gyrase but does bind to the substrate dna.  a review in 2001 suggests that cytotoxicity of fluoroquinolones is likely a 2-step process involving (1) conversion of the topoisomerase-quinolone-dna complex to an irreversible form and (2) generation of a double-strand break by denaturation of the topoisomerase.


== pharmacokinetics ==
“absorption of norfloxacin is rapid following single doses of 200 mg, 400 mg and 800 mg. at the respective doses, mean peak serum and plasma concentrations of 0.8, 1.5 and 2.4 μg/ml are attained approximately one hour after dosing. the effective half-life of norfloxacin in serum and plasma is 3–4 hours. steady-state concentrations of norfloxacin will be attained within two days of dosing.  renal excretion occurs by both glomerular filtration and tubular secretion as evidenced by the high rate of renal clearance (approximately 275 ml/min). within 24 hours of drug administration, 26 to 32% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine as norfloxacin with an additional 5-8% being recovered in the urine as six active metabolites of lesser antimicrobial potency. only a small percentage (less than 1%) of the dose is recovered thereafter. fecal recovery accounts for another 30% of the administered dose.  two to three hours after a single 400-mg dose, urinary concentrations of 200 μg/ml or more are attained in the urine. in healthy volunteers, mean urinary concentrations of norfloxacin remain above 30 μg/ml for at least 12 hours following a 400-mg dose. the urinary ph may affect the solubility of norfloxacin. norfloxacin is least soluble at urinary ph of 7.5 with greater solubility occurring at phs above and below this value. the serum protein binding of norfloxacin is between 10 and 15%.” quoting from the 2009 package insert for noroxin.biotransformation is via the liver and kidneys, with a half-life of 3–4 hours.


== history ==
the first members of the quinolone antibacterial class were relatively low potency drugs such as nalidixic acid, used mainly in the treatment of urinary tract infections owing to their renal excretion and propensity to be concentrated in urine.  in 1979 the publication of a patent filed by the pharmaceutical arm of kyorin seiyaku kabushiki kaisha disclosed the discovery of norfloxacin, and the demonstration that certain structural modifications including the attachment of a fluorine atom to the quinolone ring leads to dramatically enhanced antibacterial potency.in spite of the substantial increase in antibacterial activity of norfloxacin relative to early fluoroquinolones, it did not become a widely used antibiotic. other companies initiated fluoroquinolone discovery programs in the aftermath of the publication of the norfloxacin patent. bayer pharmaceuticals discovered that the addition of a single carbon atom to the norfloxacin structure provided another 4 to 10-fold improvement in activity.  ciprofloxacin reached the market just one year after norfloxacin and achieved sales of 1.5 billion euros at its peak.kyorin granted merck & company, inc., an exclusive license (in certain countries, including the united states), to import and distribute norfloxacin under the brand name noroxin. the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) approved noroxin for distribution in the united states on october 31, 1986.


== availability ==
in most countries, all formulations require a prescription. in colombia (south america) it is marketed under ambigram from laboratorios bussié
noroxin was discontinued in the us as of april 2014
see the latest package insert for norfloxacin (noroxin) for additional details.

sonnie hale,non_science,"sonnie hale (1 may 1902 – 9 june 1959) was an english theatre and cinema actor and director.


== early life ==
john robert hale-monro, better known by his stage name, was born in kensington, london, the son of robert hale and belle reynolds. his father, and his sister binnie hale, were actors. he was educated at beaumont college, old windsor.


== entertainer ==
he worked chiefly in musical and revue theatre, but also acted in several films with occasional screenwriting or directing credits. he first performed on stage at the london pavilion in 1921 in the chorus of the revue fun of the fayre. a major personal investment in a show to tour the country planned for late 1939 proved financially ruinous due to the outbreak of war and the subsequent closure of most theatres. his slight acquaintance evelyn waugh advised him against such an investment. his reply was reported to be the sardonic ""war is good for business, don't you know!”
his play the french mistress premiered at wimbledon theatre in 1955. it later enjoyed a long west end run before being adapted into the film a french mistress.


== personal life ==
he was married three times:

the actress evelyn laye (1926–1930).
the actress and dancer jessie matthews (1931–1944).
mary kelsey (1945–1957)he left his first marriage to evelyn laye for actress jessie matthews, an action which received backlash among the british and caused a scandal.
by his second marriage he had one son (died at birth) and one adopted daughter (born 1935); by his third marriage he had one son (born 1946) and a daughter. he also had a daughter joanna monro (born 1956) from a subsequent relationship with the actress frances bennett.
he died on 9 june 1959 in london from myelofibrosis, aged 57.

14alpha-hydroxy steroid,reagent,"a steroid is a biologically active organic compound with four rings arranged in a specific molecular configuration. steroids have two principal biological functions: as important components of cell membranes which alter membrane fluidity; and as signaling molecules. hundreds of steroids are found in plants, animals and fungi. all steroids are manufactured in cells from the sterols lanosterol (opisthokonts) or cycloartenol (plants). lanosterol and cycloartenol are derived from the cyclization of the triterpene squalene.the steroid core structure is typically composed of seventeen carbon atoms, bonded in four ""fused"" rings: three six-member cyclohexane rings (rings a, b and c in the first illustration) and one five-member cyclopentane ring (the d ring). steroids vary by the functional groups attached to this four-ring core and by the oxidation state of the rings. sterols are forms of steroids with a hydroxy group at position three and a skeleton derived from cholestane. steroids can also be more radically modified, such as by changes to the ring structure, for example, cutting one of the rings. cutting ring b produces secosteroids one of which is vitamin d3.
examples include the lipid cholesterol, the sex hormones estradiol and testosterone, and the anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone.


== nomenclature ==

gonane, also known as steran or cyclopentanoperhydrophenanthrene, the simplest steroid and the nucleus of all steroids and sterols, is composed of seventeen carbon atoms in carbon-carbon bonds forming four fused rings in a three-dimensional shape. the three cyclohexane rings (a, b, and c in the first illustration) form the skeleton of a perhydro derivative of phenanthrene. the d ring has a cyclopentane structure. when the two methyl groups and eight carbon side chains (at c-17, as shown for cholesterol) are present, the steroid is said to have a cholestane framework. the two common 5α and 5β stereoisomeric forms of steroids exist because of differences in the side of the largely planar ring system where the hydrogen (h) atom at carbon-5 is attached, which results in a change in steroid a-ring conformation. isomerisation at the c-21 side chain produces a parallel series of compounds, referred to as isosteroids.examples of steroid structures are:

		
		
		
		
		
		
in addition to the ring scissions (cleavages), expansions and contractions (cleavage and reclosing to a larger or smaller rings)—all variations in the carbon-carbon bond framework—steroids can also vary:

in the bond orders within the rings,
in the number of methyl groups attached to the ring (and, when present, on the prominent side chain at c17),
in the functional groups attached to the rings and side chain, and
in the configuration of groups attached to the rings and chain.for instance, sterols such as cholesterol and lanosterol have a hydroxyl group attached at position c-3, while testosterone and progesterone have a carbonyl (oxo substituent) at c-3; of these, lanosterol alone has two methyl groups at c-4 and cholesterol (with a c-5 to c-6 double bond) differs from testosterone and progesterone (which have a c-4 to c-5 double bond).


== species distribution and function ==

in eukaryotes, steroids are found in fungi, animals, and plants.


=== fungal steroids ===
fungal steroids include the ergosterols, which are involved in maintaining the integrity of the fungal cellular membrane. various antifungal drugs, such as amphotericin b and azole antifungals, utilize this information to kill pathogenic fungi. fungi can alter their ergosterol content (e.g. through loss of function mutations in the enzymes erg3 or erg6, inducing depletion of ergosterol, or mutations that decrease the ergosterol content) to develop resistance to drugs that target ergosterol. ergosterol is analogous to the cholesterol found in the cellular membranes of animals (including humans), or the phytosterols found in the cellular membranes of plants. all mushrooms contain large quantities of ergosterol, in the range of tens to hundreds of milligrams per 100 grams of dry weight. oxygen is necessary for the synthesis of ergosterol in fungi. ergosterol is responsible for the vitamin d content found in mushrooms; ergosterol is chemically converted into provitamin d2 by exposure to ultraviolet light. provitamin d2 spontaneously forms vitamin d2. however, not all fungi utilize ergosterol in their cellular membranes; for example, the pathogenic fungal species pneumocystis jirovecii does not, which has important clinical implications (given the mechanism of action of many antifungal drugs). using the fungus saccharomyces cerevisiae as an example, other major steroids include ergosta‐5,7,22,24(28)‐tetraen‐3β‐ol, zymosterol, and lanosterol. s. cerevisiae utilizes 5,6‐dihydroergosterol in place of ergosterol in its cell membrane.


=== animal steroids ===
animal steroids include compounds of vertebrate and insect origin, the latter including ecdysteroids such as ecdysterone (controlling molting in some species). vertebrate examples include the steroid hormones and cholesterol; the latter is a structural component of cell membranes which helps determine the fluidity of cell membranes and is a principal constituent of plaque (implicated in atherosclerosis). steroid hormones include: 

sex hormones, which influence sex differences and support reproduction. these include androgens, estrogens, and progestogens.
corticosteroids, including most synthetic steroid drugs, with natural product classes the glucocorticoids (which regulate many aspects of metabolism and immune function) and the mineralocorticoids (which help maintain blood volume and control renal excretion of electrolytes)
anabolic steroids, natural and synthetic, which interact with androgen receptors to increase muscle and bone synthesis. in popular use, the term ""steroids"" often refers to anabolic steroids.


=== plant steroids ===
plant steroids include steroidal alkaloids found in solanaceae and melanthiaceae (specially the genus veratrum), cardiac glycosides, the phytosterols and the brassinosteroids (which include several plant hormones).


=== prokaryotes ===
in prokaryotes, biosynthetic pathways exist for the tetracyclic steroid framework (e.g. in mycobacteria) – where its origin from eukaryotes is conjectured – and the more-common pentacyclic triterpinoid hopanoid framework.


== types ==


=== by function ===
the major classes of steroid hormones, with prominent members and examples of related functions, are:
corticosteroids:
glucocorticoids:
cortisol, a glucocorticoid whose functions include immunosuppression
mineralocorticoids:
aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid which helps regulate blood pressure through water and electrolyte balance
sex steroids:
progestogens:
progesterone, which regulates cyclical changes in the endometrium of the uterus and maintains a pregnancy
androgens:
testosterone, which contributes to the development and maintenance of male secondary sex characteristics
estrogens:
estradiol, which contributes to the development and maintenance of female secondary sex characteristicsadditional classes of steroids include:

neurosteroids such as dhea and allopregnanolone
aminosteroid neuromuscular blocking agents such as pancuronium bromideas well as the following class of secosteroids (open-ring steroids):

vitamin d forms such as ergocalciferol, cholecalciferol, and calcitriol


=== by structure ===


==== intact ring system ====
steroids can be classified based on their chemical composition. one example of how mesh performs this classification is available at the wikipedia mesh catalog. examples of this classification include:

the gonane (steroid nucleus) is the parent 17-carbon tetracyclic hydrocarbon molecule with no alkyl sidechains.


==== cleaved, contracted, and expanded rings ====
secosteroids (latin seco, ""to cut"") are a subclass of steroidal compounds resulting, biosynthetically or conceptually, from scission (cleavage) of parent steroid rings (generally one of the four). major secosteroid subclasses are defined by the steroid carbon atoms where this scission has taken place. for instance, the prototypical secosteroid cholecalciferol, vitamin d3 (shown), is in the 9,10-secosteroid subclass and derives from the cleavage of carbon atoms c-9 and c-10 of the steroid b-ring; 5,6-secosteroids and 13,14-steroids are similar.norsteroids (nor-, l. norma; ""normal"" in chemistry, indicating carbon removal) and homosteroids (homo-, greek homos; ""same"", indicating carbon addition) are structural subclasses of steroids formed from biosynthetic steps. the former involves enzymic ring expansion-contraction reactions, and the latter is accomplished (biomimetically) or (more frequently) through ring closures of acyclic precursors with more (or fewer) ring atoms than the parent steroid framework.combinations of these ring alterations are known in nature. for instance, ewes who graze on corn lily ingest cyclopamine (shown) and veratramine, two of a sub-family of steroids where the c- and d-rings are contracted and expanded respectively via a biosynthetic migration of the original c-13 atom. ingestion of these c-nor-d-homosteroids results in birth defects in lambs: cyclopia from cyclopamine and leg deformity from veratramine. a further c-nor-d-homosteroid (nakiterpiosin) is excreted by okinawan cyanobacteriosponges. e.g., terpios hoshinota, leading to coral mortality from black coral disease.  nakiterpiosin-type steroids are active against the signaling pathway involving the smoothened and hedgehog proteins, a pathway which is hyperactive in a number of cancers.


== biological significance ==
steroids and their metabolites often function as signalling molecules (the most notable examples are steroid hormones), and steroids and phospholipids are components of cell membranes. steroids such as cholesterol decrease membrane fluidity.
similar to lipids, steroids are highly concentrated energy stores. however, they are not typically sources of energy; in mammals, they are normally metabolized and excreted.
steroids play critical roles in a number of disorders, including malignancies like prostate cancer, where steroid production inside and outside the tumour promotes cancer cell aggressiveness.


== biosynthesis and metabolism ==

the hundreds of steroids found in animals, fungi, and plants are made from lanosterol (in animals and fungi; see examples above) or cycloartenol (in plants). lanosterol and cycloartenol derive from cyclization of the triterpenoid squalene.steroid biosynthesis is an anabolic pathway which produces steroids from simple precursors. a unique biosynthetic pathway is followed in animals (compared to many other organisms), making the pathway a common target for antibiotics and other anti-infection drugs. steroid metabolism in humans is also the target of cholesterol-lowering drugs, such as statins.
in humans and other animals the biosynthesis of steroids follows the mevalonate pathway, which uses acetyl-coa as building blocks for dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (dmapp) and isopentenyl pyrophosphate (ipp). in subsequent steps dmapp and ipp join to form geranyl pyrophosphate (gpp), which synthesizes the steroid lanosterol. modifications of lanosterol into other steroids are classified as steroidogenesis transformations.


=== mevalonate pathway ===

the mevalonate pathway (also called hmg-coa reductase pathway) begins with acetyl-coa and ends with dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (dmapp) and isopentenyl pyrophosphate (ipp).
dmapp and ipp donate isoprene units, which are assembled and modified to form terpenes and isoprenoids (a large class of lipids, which include the carotenoids and form the largest class of plant natural products. here, the isoprene units are joined to make squalene and folded into a set of rings to make lanosterol. lanosterol can then be converted into other steroids, such as cholesterol and ergosterol.
two classes of drugs target the mevalonate pathway: statins (like rosuvastatin), which are used to reduce elevated cholesterol levels, and bisphosphonates (like zoledronate), which are used to treat a number of bone-degenerative diseases.


=== steroidogenesis ===

steroidogenesis is the biological process by which steroids are generated from cholesterol and changed into other steroids. the pathways of steroidogenesis differ among species. the major classes of steroid hormones, as noted above (with their prominent members and functions), are the progestogen, corticosteroids (corticoids), androgens, and estrogens. human steroidogenesis of these classes occurs in a number of locations:

progestogens are the precursors of all other human steroids, and all human tissues which produce steroids must first convert cholesterol to pregnenolone. this conversion is the rate-limiting step of steroid synthesis, which occurs inside the mitochondrion of the respective tissue.
cortisol, corticosterone, aldosterone, and testosterone are produced in the adrenal cortex.
estradiol, estrone and progesterone are made primarily in the ovary, estriol in placenta during pregnancy, and testosterone primarily in the testes (some testosterone is also produced in the adrenal cortex).
estradiol is converted from testosterone directly (in males), or via the primary pathway dhea - androstenedione - estrone and secondarily via testosterone (in females).
stromal cells have been shown to produce steroids in response to signaling produced by androgen-starved prostate cancer cells.
some neurons and glia in the central nervous system (cns) express the enzymes required for the local synthesis of pregnenolone, progesterone, dhea and dheas, de novo or from peripheral sources.


=== alternative pathways ===
in plants and bacteria, the non-mevalonate pathway uses pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as substrates.during diseases pathways otherwise not significant in healthy humans can become utilized. for example, in one form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia a deficiency in the 21-hydroxylase enzymatic pathway leads to an excess of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (17-ohp) – this pathological excess of 17-ohp in turn may be converted to dihydrotestosterone (dht, a potent androgen) through among others 17,20 lyase (a member of the cytochrome p450 family of enzymes), 5α-reductase and 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.


== catabolism and excretion ==
steroids are primarily oxidized by cytochrome p450 oxidase enzymes, such as cyp3a4. these reactions introduce oxygen into the steroid ring, allowing the cholesterol to be broken up by other enzymes into bile acids. these acids can then be eliminated by secretion from the liver in bile. the expression of the oxidase gene can be upregulated by the steroid sensor pxr when there is a high blood concentration of steroids. steroid hormones, lacking the side chain of cholesterol and bile acids, are typically hydroxylated at various ring positions or oxidized at the 17 position, conjugated with sulfate or glucuronic acid and excreted in the urine.


== isolation, structure determination, and methods of analysis ==
steroid isolation, depending on context, is the isolation of chemical matter required for chemical structure elucidation, derivitzation or degradation chemistry, biological testing, and other research needs (generally milligrams to grams, but often more or the isolation of ""analytical quantities"" of the substance of interest (where the focus is on identifying and quantifying the substance (for example, in biological tissue or fluid). the amount isolated depends on the analytical method, but is generally less than one microgram. the methods of isolation to achieve the two scales of product are distinct, but include extraction, precipitation, adsorption, chromatography, and crystallization. in both cases, the isolated substance is purified to chemical homogeneity; combined separation and analytical methods, such as lc-ms, are chosen to be ""orthogonal""—achieving their separations based on distinct modes of interaction between substance and isolating matrix—to detect a single species in the pure sample. structure determination refers to the methods to determine the chemical structure of an isolated pure steroid, using an evolving array of chemical and physical methods which have included nmr and small-molecule crystallography. methods of analysis overlap both of the above areas, emphasizing analytical methods to determining if a steroid is present in a mixture and determining its quantity.


== chemical synthesis ==
microbial catabolism of phytosterol side chains yields c-19 steroids, c-22 steroids, and 17-ketosteroids (i.e. precursors  to adrenocortical hormones and contraceptives).  the addition and modification of functional groups is key when producing the wide variety of medications available within this chemical classification. these modifications are performed using conventional organic synthesis and/or biotransformation techniques.


=== precursors ===


==== semisynthesis ====
the semisynthesis of steroids often begins from precursors such as cholesterol, phytosterols, or sapogenins. the efforts of syntex, a company involved in the mexican barbasco trade, used dioscorea mexicana to produce the sapogenin diosgenin in the early days of the synthetic steroid pharmaceutical industry.


==== total synthesis ====
some steroidal hormones are economically obtained only by total synthesis from petrochemicals (e.g. 13-alkyl steroids). for example, the pharmaceutical norgestrel begins from methoxy-1-tetralone, a petrochemical derived from phenol.


== research awards ==
a number of nobel prizes have been awarded for steroid research, including:

1927 (chemistry) heinrich otto wieland — constitution of bile acids and sterols and their connection to vitamins
1928 (chemistry) adolf otto reinhold windaus — constitution of sterols and their connection to vitamins

calmodulin (mouse),protein,"calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type ii subunit alpha (camkiiα), a.k.a. ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii alpha, is one subunit of camkii, a protein kinase (i.e., an enzyme which phosphorylates proteins) that in humans is encoded by the camk2a gene.


== function ==
the product of the camk2a gene is an enzyme that belongs to the serine/threonine-specific protein kinase family, as well as the ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii subfamily. ca2+ signaling is crucial for several aspects of synaptic plasticity at glutamatergic synapses. this enzyme is composed of four different chains: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. the alpha chain encoded by this gene is required for hippocampal long-term potentiation (ltp) and spatial learning. in addition to its calcium-calmodulin (cam)-dependent activity, this protein can undergo autophosphorylation, resulting in cam-independent activity. two transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified for this gene.

delafloxacin,antibiotic,"delafloxacin sold under the brand name baxdela among others, is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic used to treat acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections.


== medical use ==
delafloxacin is indicated to treat adults with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssi) caused by designated susceptible bacteria or adults with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (cabp) caused by designated susceptible bacteria.susceptible bacteria for absssi are:
gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant [mrsa] and methicillin-susceptible [mssa] isolates), staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus lugdunensis, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus anginosus group (including streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, and streptococcus constellatus), streptococcus pyogenes, and enterococcus faecalis
gram-negative organisms: escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa.susceptible bacteria for cabp are:streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible [mssa] isolates only), klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, chlamydia pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, and mycoplasma pneumoniae.
it has not been tested in pregnant women.in the european union it is indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssi) in adults when it is considered inappropriate to use other antibacterial agents that are commonly recommended for the initial treatment of these infections.


== adverse effects ==
like other drugs in the fluoroquinolone class, delafloxacin contains a black box warning about the risk of  tendinitis, tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, central nervous system effects, and exacerbation of myasthenia gravis. the label also warns against the risk of hypersensitivity reactions and clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea.adverse effects occurring in more than 2% of clinical trial subjects included nausea, diarrhea, headache, elevated transaminases, and vomiting.


== interactions ==
like other fluoroquinolones, delafloxacin chelates metals including aluminum, magnesium, sucralfate, iron, zinc, and divalent and trivalent cations like didanosine; using this drugs with antacids, some dietary supplements, or drugs buffered with any of these ions will interfere with available amounts of delafloxacin.


== pharmacology ==
the half-life varies in around 8 hours at normal doses.  excretion is 65% through urine, mostly in unmetabolized form, and 28% via feces.  clearance is reduced in people with severe kidney disease.delafloxacin is more active (lower mic90) than other quinolones against gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). in contrast to most approved fluoroquinolones, which are zwitterionic, delafloxacin has an anionic character, which results in a 10-fold increase in delafloxacin accumulation in both bacteria and cells at acidic ph. this property is believed to confer to delafloxacin an advantage for the eradication of staphylococcus aureus in acidic environments, including intracellular infections and biofilms.


== chemistry ==
the chemical name is 1-deoxy-1 (methylamino)-d-glucitol, 1-(6-amino-3,5-difluoropyridin-2-yl)-8-chloro-6-fluoro-7-(3-hydroxyazetidin-1-yl)-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylate (salt).the injectable form of delafloxacin is sold as the meglumine salt of the active ingredient and its united states adopted name, delafloxacin meglumine, reflects that; the injection formulation also includes edta and sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin.   the tablet is made of delafloxacin, citric acid anhydrous, crospovidone, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, sodium bicarbonate, and sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate.


== history ==
delafloxacin was known as abt-492, rx-3341, and wq-3034 while it was under development.rib-x pharmaceuticals acquired delafloxacin from wakunaga pharmaceutical in 2006.  rib-x was renamed to melinta therapeutics in 2013. it was developed and marketed by melinta therapeutics (formerly rib-x pharmaceuticals), which subsequently merged with cempra.key clinical trials for delafloxacin have been performed by melinta regarding indications for skin and skin structure infections as well as complicated bacterial infections and uncomplicated gonorrhea. the trial on gonorrhea was terminated before data was released.delafloxacin was approved by the fda in june 2017, after it was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam in two trials on 1042 patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection. new drug applications (nda) for delafloxacin (baxdela) 450 mg tablets and 300 mg injections were approved by the fda in june 2017.the fda obligated melinta to conduct further studies as follows:
a 5-year surveillance study to determine if resistance emerges, with the final report due in december 2022
a study of the iv form in pregnant rats to determine distribution to the reproductive tract, due june 2018, with further studies required if there is significant distribution.melinta merged with cempra in august, 2017.melinta has entered into commercialization and distribution agreements with both menarini therapeutics (march 2017) and eurofarma laboratórios (january 2015) for international commercialization of delafloxacin. the agreement with menarini allows them to commercialize and distribute in 68 countries, including europe, china, and south korea among others. a similar agreement with eurofarma allows for commercialization in brazil.

tagraxofusp injection,drug,"tagraxofusp, sold under the brand name elzonris, is an anti-cancer medication for the treatment of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (bpdcn).  it was approved for use in the united states in 2018.the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) considers it to be a first-in-class medication.tagraxofusp is a fusion protein consisting of interleukin 3 (il-3) fused to diphtheria toxin. the fusion protein readily kills cultured pdc by binding to their il-3 receptors to thereby gain entrance to the cells and then blocking these cells' protein synthesis (due to its diphtheria toxin portion inhibiting eukaryotic elongation factor 2).


== society and culture ==


=== legal status ===
in july 2020, the european medicines agency (ema) recommended the refusal of the marketing authorization for tagraxofusp. the agency was concerned that due to the design of the study and the small number of participants, it was not possible to be sure how effective the medicine was in treating blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm. in addition, the medicine could cause capillary leak syndrome (an unpredictable, potentially life-threatening side effect due to increased permeability of small blood vessels), which had led to some fatal outcomes.on 12 november 2020, the committee for medicinal products for human use (chmp) of the ema adopted a positive opinion following a re-examination procedure,  recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product elzonris, intended for the treatment of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (bpdcn). tagraxofusp was approved for medical use in the european union in january 2021.

shindig (firefly),non_science,"""shindig"" is the fourth episode of the science fiction television series firefly created by joss whedon.
inara attends a formal society dance, only to find malcolm there as well, attempting to set up a smuggling job. mal comes to blows with inara's conceited date and finds himself facing a duel with a renowned swordsman, and only one night to learn how to fence.


== synopsis ==
the crew lands on persephone.  in her shuttle quarters, inara scans potential clients and chooses local aristocrat atherton wing, a regular customer. mal and jayne are accosted by badger, who needs mal's help to move an illegal cargo for high-society local warrick harrow, who will not talk to the likes of badger. he provides mal and kaylee with tickets to the very ball that inara will be attending.
at the ball, atherton asks inara to be his personal companion, remaining in a world more suited to her, but she diplomatically defers a decision. suddenly, the arrival of ""miss kaywinnet lee frye and escort"" is announced—kaylee, in a ruffled dress she had earlier coveted in a shop window, accompanied by mal.
back on serenity, simon, book, and jayne play a card game, using ship chores as currency. river, experiencing another of her manic outbursts, frantically shreds the blue sun labels of their canned food supplies. meanwhile, wash and zoe have sex.
at the ball, kaylee's friendly attempt to mix with the debutantes fails, but she is rescued by an older gentleman, then drawn to a group of several mechanically-minded men. meanwhile, mal finds sir warrick, who is cool to any proposal that badger is behind, despite mal's professionalism. just then, atherton wing, with inara in tow, interrupts their conversation. mal escorts inara onto the dance floor, but when atherton cuts in and insists on his right to take inara away because ""money changed hands"", mal punches him in the face, unknowingly making a challenge that commits him to a duel by sword against expert swordsman atherton. sir warrick agrees to be his second.
on serenity, badger arrives uninvited to explain to the remaining crew that mal will be participating in a duel. as the crew  discusses how to rescue him, badger disabuses them of this idea — he is here with his men to sit on them until the duel is finished.
as mal ineptly practices for the duel, inara sneaks into his room to talk; she is confused by mal's decision to punch atherton because he insulted her, when mal often does this himself. mal replies that he merely insults her profession, whereas wing insulted her.
in the meantime, the crew of serenity sits in the cargo hold, attempting to plot an escape from the watchful eyes of badger and his cronies. jayne comes up with the idea that they need a diversion.  river appears and, in a display of her as-yet unrevealed talents, converses with badger in his own accent, mentioning his heretofore unknown past. river departs, leaving a confounded but amused badger. jayne realizes that river's distraction of badger is exactly what the crew could've used.
in the duel, atherton wounds mal several times through tricky swordplay, and when he has mal at his mercy, turns at a plea from inara, who offers to stay with him if he will only spare mal's life. mal uses his distraction to disarm the swordsman, deliver a punch to the face, and throw his own broken sword blade at him, stabbing him in the shoulder.
mal stands over the wounded wing, wielding wing's own sword, and sir warrick demands that he deliver the final blow, lest atherton be humiliated. mal, however, shows mercy (after getting in two more pokes). as inara helps mal off the field, atherton calls out viciously to inara and threatens to ruin her. inara responds by informing him that he is now persona non grata in the companion registry, implicitly ruining him. entertained by mal's trouncing of the conceited wing, and impressed by his tenacity, sir warrick agrees to send his cargo with mal.
the as-yet-unbegun escape plan plotted by the serenity crew is aborted by the return of inara and mal, who chases a pleased badger off his ship. inara and mal share a moment on the cargo bay landing, watching over their cargo from harrow — a bay full of cattle.


== production ==
the writer of this episode, jane espenson, revealed how she enjoyed writing this episode, as it gave her a chance to invent a card game, as well as write dialog in ""jane austen style"". the sword fight took place near a disney-owned production facility and so the shots had to be framed to exclude the ""country bear jamboree"" barn located in the background.according to dvd commentary, the role of badger was originally written to be played by joss whedon. instead the role was given to mark sheppard.
the ballgown that inara wears at the ball was actually made out of costume designer shawna trpcic's wedding dress. the t-shirt that jayne wears during the episode contains the chinese word yong (勇), which means ""soldier"" or more commonly ""brave"". this shirt also appears in the episodes ""the train job"", ""ariel"", and ""war stories"".

ramucirumab injection,drug,"dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid medication used to treat rheumatic problems, a number of skin diseases, severe allergies, asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, croup, brain swelling, eye pain following eye surgery, and along with antibiotics in tuberculosis. in adrenocortical insufficiency, it may be used in combination with a mineralocorticoid medication such as fludrocortisone. in preterm labor, it may be used to improve outcomes in the baby. it may be given by mouth, as an injection into a muscle, as an injection into a vein, as a topical cream or ointment for the skin or as a topical ophthalmic solution to the eye. the effects of dexamethasone are frequently seen within a day and last for about three days.the long-term use of dexamethasone may result in thrush, bone loss, cataracts, easy bruising, or muscle weakness. it is in pregnancy category c in the united states, meaning that it should only be used when the benefits are predicted to be greater than the risks. in australia, the oral use is category a, meaning it has been frequently used in pregnancy and not been found to cause problems to the baby. it should not be taken when breastfeeding. dexamethasone has anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects.dexamethasone was first synthesized in 1957 by philip showalter hench and was approved for medical use in 1961. it is on the world health organization's list of essential medicines. in 2017, it was the 321st most commonly prescribed medication in the united states, with more than one million prescriptions.


== medical uses ==


=== anti-inflammatory ===
dexamethasone is used to treat many inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and bronchospasm. idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, a decrease in numbers of platelets due to an immune problem, responds to 40 mg daily for four days; it may be administered in 14-day cycles. it is unclear whether dexamethasone in this condition is significantly better than other glucocorticoids.it is also given in small amounts before and/or after some forms of dental surgery, such as the extraction of the wisdom teeth, an operation which often causes puffy, swollen cheeks.dexamethasone is commonly given as a treatment for croup in children, as a single dose can reduce the swelling of the airway to improve breathing and reduce discomfort.it is injected into the heel when treating plantar fasciitis, sometimes in conjunction with triamcinolone acetonide.it is useful to counteract allergic anaphylactic shock, if given in high doses.it is present in certain eye drops – particularly after eye surgery – and as a nasal spray, and certain ear drops (can be combined with an antibiotic and an antifungal). dexamethasone intravitreal steroid implants have been approved by the fda  to treat ocular conditions such as diabetic macular edema, central retinal vein occlusion, and uveitis. dexamethasone has also been used with antibiotics to treat acute endophthalmitis.dexamethasone is used in transvenous screw-in cardiac pacing leads to minimize the inflammatory response of the myocardium. the steroid is released into the myocardium as soon as the screw is extended and can play a significant role in minimizing the acute pacing threshold due to the reduction of inflammatory response. the typical quantity present in a lead tip is less than 1.0 mg.dexamethasone may be administered before antibiotics in cases of bacterial meningitis. it acts to reduce the inflammatory response of the body to the bacteria killed by the antibiotics (bacterial death releases proinflammatory mediators that can cause a response which is harmful), thus reducing hearing loss and neurological damage.


=== cancer ===
people with cancer undergoing chemotherapy are often given dexamethasone to counteract certain side effects of their antitumor treatments. dexamethasone can increase the antiemetic effect of 5-ht3 receptor antagonists, such as ondansetron. the exact mechanism of this interaction is not well-defined, but it has been theorized that this effect may be due to, among many other causes, inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, anti-inflammatory effects, immunosuppressive effects, decreased release of endogenous opioids, or a combination of the aforementioned.in brain tumors (primary or metastatic), dexamethasone is used to counteract the development of edema, which could eventually compress other brain structures. it is also given in cord compression, where a tumor is compressing the spinal cord.dexamethasone is also used as a direct chemotherapeutic agent in certain hematological malignancies, especially in the treatment of multiple myeloma, in which dexamethasone is given alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs, including most commonly with thalidomide (thal-dex), lenalidomide, bortezomib (velcade, vel-dex), or a combination of doxorubicin (adriamycin) and vincristine or bortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone.


=== covid‑19 ===

dexamethasone is recommended by the national health service in the uk and the national institutes of health (nih) in the us for patients with covid-19 who need either mechanical ventilation or supplemental oxygen (without ventilation). dexamethasone is otherwise not recommended.the infectious diseases society of america (idsa) guideline panel suggests the use of glucocorticoids for patients with severe covid-19, defined as patients with spo2 ≤94% on room air, and those who require supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo). the idsa recommends against the use of glucocorticoids for those with covid‑19 without hypoxemia requiring supplemental oxygen.the world health organization (who) recommends systemic corticosteroids rather than no systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of people with severe and critical covid-19 (strong recommendation, based on moderate certainty evidence). the who suggests not to use corticosteroids in the treatment of people with non-severe covid-19 (conditional recommendation, based on low certainty evidence).a meta-analysis of seven clinical trials of critically ill covid-19 patients, each treated with one of three different corticosteroids found a statistically significant reduction in death. the largest reduction was obtained with dexamethasone (36% compared to placebo).in september 2020, the european medicines agency (ema) endorsed the use of dexamethasone in adults and adolescents (from twelve years of age and weighing at least 40 kg) who require supplemental oxygen therapy. dexamethasone can be taken by mouth or given as an injection or infusion (drip) into a vein.


=== endocrine ===
dexamethasone is the treatment for the very rare disorder of glucocorticoid resistance.in adrenal insufficiency and addison's disease, dexamethasone is prescribed when the patient does not respond well to prednisone or methylprednisolone.it can be used in congenital adrenal hyperplasia in older adolescents and adults to suppress acth production. it is typically given at night.


=== pregnancy ===
dexamethasone may be given to women at risk of delivering prematurely to promote maturation of the fetus' lungs. this administration, given from day to one week before delivery, has been associated with low birth weight, although not with increased rates of neonatal death.dexamethasone has also been used during pregnancy as an off-label prenatal treatment for the symptoms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (cah) in female babies. cah causes a variety of physical abnormalities, notably ambiguous genitalia. early prenatal cah treatment has been shown to reduce some cah symptoms, but it does not treat the underlying congenital disorder. this use is controversial: it is inadequately studied, only around one in ten of the fetuses of women treated are at risk of the condition, and serious adverse events have been documented. experimental use of dexamethasone in pregnancy for fetal cah treatment was discontinued in sweden when one in five cases suffered adverse events.a small clinical trial found long-term effects on verbal working memory among the small group of children treated prenatally, but the small number of test subjects means the study cannot be considered definitive.


=== high-altitude illnesses ===
dexamethasone is used in the treatment of high-altitude cerebral edema (hace), as well as high-altitude pulmonary edema (hape). it is commonly carried on mountain-climbing expeditions to help climbers deal with complications of altitude sickness.


=== nausea and vomiting ===
intravenous dexamethasone is effective for prevention of nausea and vomiting in people who had surgery and whose post-operative pain was treated with long-acting spinal or epidural spinal opioids.the combination of dexamethasone and a 5-ht3 receptor antagonist such as ondansetron is more effective than a 5-ht3 receptor antagonist alone in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting.


=== sore throat ===
a single dose of dexamethasone or another steroid speeds improvement of a sore throat.


== contraindications ==
contraindications of dexamethasone include, but are not limited to:

uncontrolled infections
known hypersensitivity to dexamethasone
cerebral malaria
systemic fungal infection
concurrent treatment with live virus vaccines (including smallpox vaccine)


== adverse effects ==
the exact incidence of the adverse effects of dexamethasone are not available, hence estimates have been made as to the incidence of the adverse effects below based on the adverse effects of related corticosteroids and on available documentation on dexamethasone.


=== common ===


=== unknown frequency ===


=== withdrawal ===
sudden withdrawal after long-term treatment with corticosteroids can lead to:


== interactions ==
known drug interactions include:
inducers of hepatic microsomal enzymes such as barbiturates, phenytoin, and rifampicin can reduce the half-life of dexamethasone.
cotreatment with oral contraceptives can increase its volume of distribution.


== pharmacology ==
as a glucocorticoid, dexamethasone is an agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor (gr). it has minimal mineralocorticoid activity.


== chemistry ==
dexamethasone is a synthetic pregnane corticosteroid and derivative of cortisol (hydrocortisone) and is also known as 1-dehydro-9α-fluoro-16α-methylhydrocortisone or as 9α-fluoro-11β,17α,21-trihydroxy-16α-methylpregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione. the molecular and crystal structure of dexamethasone has been determined by x-ray crystallography. it is a stereoisomer of betamethasone, the two compounds differing only in the spatial configuration of the methyl group at position 16 (see steroid nomenclature).


=== synthesis ===
to synthesize dexamethasone, 16β-methylprednisolone acetate is dehydrated to the 9,11-dehydro derivative. this is then reacted with a source of hypobromite, such as basic n-bromosuccinimide, to form the 9α-bromo-11β-hydrin derivative, which is then ring-closed to an epoxide. a ring-opening reaction with hydrogen fluoride in tetrahydrofuran gives dexamethasone.


== history ==
dexamethasone was first synthesized by philip showalter hench in 1957. it was introduced for medical use in 1958.on 16 june 2020, the recovery trial announced preliminary results stating that dexamethasone improves survival rates of hospitalized patients with covid‑19 receiving oxygen or on a ventilator. benefits were only observed in patients requiring respiratory support; those who did not require breathing support saw a worse survival rate than the control group, although the difference may have been due to chance. 
a preprint containing the full dataset was published on 22 june 2020 and demand for dexamethasone surged after publication of the preprint. the preliminary report was published in the new england journal of medicine on 18 july 2020.the world health organization (who) states that dexamethasone should be reserved for seriously ill and critical patients receiving covid‑19 treatment in a hospital setting, and the who director-general stated that ""who emphasizes that dexamethasone should only be used for patients with severe or critical disease, under close clinical supervision. there is no evidence this drug works for patients with mild disease or as a preventative measure, and it could cause harm."" in july 2020, the who stated they are in the process of updating treatment guidelines to include dexamethasone or other steroids. in september 2020, the who released updated guidance on using corticosteroids for covid‑19.in july 2020, the european medicines agency (ema) started reviewing results from the recovery study arm that involved the use of dexamethasone in the treatment of patients with covid‑19 admitted to the hospital to provide an opinion on the results and in particular the potential use of dexamethasone for the treatment of adults with covid-19. in september 2020, the ema received an application for marketing authorization of dexamethasone for covid‑19.


== society and culture ==


=== price ===
dexamethasone is inexpensive. in the united states a month of medication is typically priced less than us$25. in india, a course of treatment for preterm labor is about us$0.50. the drug is available in most areas of the world.


=== nonmedical use ===
dexamethasone is given in legal bangladesh brothels to prostitutes not yet of legal age, causing weight gain aimed at making them appear older and healthier to customers and police.dexamethasone and most glucocorticoids are banned by sporting bodies including the world anti-doping agency.


== veterinary use ==
combined with marbofloxacin and clotrimazole, dexamethasone is available under the name aurizon, cas number 115550-35-1, and used to treat difficult ear infections, especially in dogs. it can also be combined with trichlormethiazide to treat horses with swelling of distal limbs and general bruising.

"hermanice, ustroń",non_science,"hermanice is a district of ustroń, silesian voivodeship, poland. it was a separate municipality, but became administratively a part of ustroń in 1945.


== history ==
the village was first mentioned in 1484. it belonged then to the duchy of teschen, a fee of the kingdom of bohemia. politically the village belonged then to the duchy of teschen, a fee of the kingdom of bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the habsburg monarchy.
in 1837 a paper mill was moved here from ustroń. in the 1870s a housing estate was built here to accommodate 80 families of workers of a forge in a nearby ustroń.
after revolutions of 1848 in the austrian empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established austrian silesia. the village as a municipality was subscribed to the political district of bielsko and the legal district of skoczów. according to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 749 in 1880 to 917 in 1910, with a growing majority of the inhabitants being native polish-speakers (85.5% in 1880 and 94.9% in 1910) and dwindling minority german-speaking (11.5% in 1880 and 5.1% in 1910) and czech-speaking (22 or 3% in 1880 and zero since 1900), with a majority of protestants (54.7% in 1910), followed by roman catholics (44.8% in 1910) and jews (5 people). the village was also traditionally inhabited by cieszyn vlachs, speaking cieszyn silesian dialect.
after world war i, fall of austria-hungary, polish–czechoslovak war and the division of cieszyn silesia in 1920, it became a part of poland. it was then annexed by nazi germany at the beginning of world war ii. after the war it was restored to poland.

ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme e2 29 (arabidopsis thaliana),protein,"ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme e2 variant 2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ube2v2 gene. ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme e2 variant proteins constitute a distinct subfamily within the e2 protein family.


== structure ==
ube2v2 has sequence similarity to other ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes but lack the conserved cysteine residue that is critical for the catalytic activity of e2s. the protein encoded by this gene also shares homology with ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme e2 variant 1 and yeast mms2 gene product.


== function ==
ube2v2 has also been implicated as an intracellular sensor of reactive electrophilic species, which are present in high levels during periods of pathogenic and/or environmental stress. the c69 residue of ube2v2 is capable of binding with various res. it has been shown that binding of res to ube2v2 promotes ube2v2-mediated activation of ube2n, another e2 protein that complexes with ube2v2. activated ube2n has been shown to play a major role in promoting dna-damage responses. thus, ube2v2 may promote genome integrity by directly sensing res and effecting dna damage responses. it may also be involved in the differentiation of monocytes and enterocytes.


== interactions ==
ube2v2 has been shown to interact with hltf. although ube2v2 itself lacks ubiquitin-conjugating activity, it can interact with different ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes to facilitate their catalytic activities. for instance, ube2v2 can complex with ube2n to form a heterodimer capable of synthesizing lys-63 linked polyubiquitin chains. ube2v2 may facilitate ube2n activity by coordinating ube2n's positioning to promote ubiquitin chain formation specifically at lys-63, as the ubiquitin molecule has multiple potential lysine binding sites. similarly, it has been shown that ube2v2 interact with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, ubc13, to induce ubc13 to adopt an active conformation that can create lys-63 polyubituitin chains on various substrates.addition of lys-63 polyubiquitin chains to intracellular targets is distinct from the canonical lys-48 polyubiquitin chains in that lys-63 chains do not mediate proteasomal degradation of its substrate. although their function remains poorly characterized, lys-63 chains have been shown to regulate signaling pathways by either activating or inhibiting its target protein function. for example, trim5alpha restriction of retroviral reverse-transcription is dependent on ube2v2/ube2n-mediated poly-ubiquitination. ube2v2 has been shown to regulate trim21 antiviral activity in an analogous manner.

immature cd11c-low plasmacytoid dendritic cell,cell,"blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (bpdcn) is a rare hematologic malignancy. it was initially regarded as a form of lymphocyte-derived cutaneous  lymphoma and alternatively named cd4+cd56+ hematodermic tumor, blastic nk cell lymphoma, and agranular cd4+ nk cell leukemia. later, however, the disease was determined to be a malignancy of plasmacytoid dendritic cells rather than lymphocytes and therefore termed blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm. in 2016, the world health organization designated bpdcn to be in its own separate category within the myeloid class of neoplasms. it is estimated that bpdcn  constitutes 0.44% of all hematological malignancies.blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm is an aggressive malignancy with features of cutaneous lymphoma (e.g. malignant plasmacytoid dendritic cell infiltrations into the skin to form single or multiple lesions) and/or leukemia (i.e. malignant plasmacytoid dendritic cells in blood and bone marrow). while commonly presenting with these clinical features, bpdcn, particularly in its more advanced stages, may also involve  malignant plasmacytoid dendritic cell infiltrations in and thereby injury to the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, central nervous system, or other tissues. the neoplasm occurs in individuals of all ages but predominates in the elderly; in children, it afflicts males and females equally but in adults is far more common (~75% of cases) in males.blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm typically responds to chemotherapy regimens used to treat hematological malignancies. all too often, however, the disease rapidly recurs and does so in a more drug-resistant form. furthermore, the disease may occur in association with the myelodysplastic syndrome or transform to acute myeloid leukemia. consequently, bpdcn has a very low 5 year survival rate. current translational research studies on treating bpdcn have therefore focused on non-chemotherapeutic regimens that target the molecular pathways which may promote the disease.


== presentation ==
blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm occurs in children, including neonates, but is more common in adults, particularly those between the ages 60–80. bpdcn usually (i.e. 61% to 90% of cases) presents with skin lesions, i.e. nodules, tumors, red or purple papules, bruise-like patches, and/or ulcers that most often occur on the head, face, and upper torso. the lesions are due to diffuse infiltrations of the skin by malignant pdc. in one large study, this presentation was accompanied by swollen lymph nodes, usually in the neck, due to malignant pdc infiltrations (~50% of cases); enlarged liver (~16% of cases) and/or spleen (26% of cases), also due to malignant pdc infiltrations; increased levels of malignant pdc in blood (i.e. >2% of nucleated cells) (~40% of cases), bone marrow (~65% of cases) and cerebrospinal fluid (47% of childhood cases but less often detected in adult cases). more advanced or severe cases may present with extreme organ and/or lymph node enlargements, skin lesions in virtually any site, and clinical evidence of malignant pdc infiltrations in the breasts, eyes, kidneys, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, bone, sinuses, ears, or testes. about 10% of individuals with bpdcn present with a leukemia-like disease, i.e. they exhibit circulating malignant pdc, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and/or leukopenia due to extensive malignant pdc infiltrations in the bone marrow. a leukemic phase of the disease is a common feature of end stage and post-therapy relapsing bpdcn.


== pathophysiology ==
there are three types of dendritic cells, plasmacytic dendritic cells (pdc) and two types of conventional dendritic cells (cdc), myeloid cdc1 and myeloid cdc2. pdc circulate in the blood, representing <0.4% of all nucleated blood cells, and are present in various hematological tissues such as lymph nodes and spleen. their major function is to detect and then initiate immune responses  to intracellular pathogens, particularly viruses such as the cold sore-causing herpes simplex viruses, hiv, and hepatitis viruses but also bacteria such as the tuberculosis-causing mycobacterium tuberculosis, fungi such as the aspergillosis-causing aspergillus fumigatus and parasites such as malaria-causing plasmodium falciparum. following detection of these intracellular pathogens, pcd initiate immune responses by producing massive amounts of type i and type iii interferons as well as by differentiating (i.e. maturing) into conventional dendritic cells that further promote immune responses by, e.g. functioning as antigen-presenting cells. the malignant pdc in bpdcn have the appearance of immature plasmacytoid dendritic cells. they are distinguished from other dendritic, myeloid, lymphoid and nk cell types by exhibiting at least several of the following properties: 1) plasmacytoid morphology; 2) production of large amounts of type i interferons when properly stimulated; 3) ability to differentiate into conventional dendritic cells when properly stimulated; 4) the expression of key marker proteins such as granzyme b, tcf4,  interleukin-3 receptor (i.e. cd123), clec4c, and neuropilin, and 5) failure to express certain marker proteins that are commonly expressed by myeloid, lymphoid, and nk cell lineages.blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm typically arises after the serial acquisition of multiple genetic abnormalities in pdc or their precursor cells. inactivating mutations (i.e. mutations which cause the gene to make no or a less active product) in the tet2 gene are the most common genetic abnormality in the disease, occurring in 32-67% of all bpdcn cases and often accompanied by mutations in either the npm1 or srsf2 gene. numerous other genetic abnormalities are associated with the disease: 1) mutations in nras, asxl1, and tp53; 2) deletions of the cdkn2a-arf-cdkn2b locus on the short arm of chromosome 9,  cdkn1b locus on the short arm of chromosome 12, rb1 locus on the long arm of chromosome 13, or nrc1 locus on the long arm of chromosome 5; 3) fusions of kmt2a on the long arm of chromosome 11 with mllt1 on the short arm of chromosome 10, supt3h on the short arm of chromosome with myc on the long arm of chromosome 8, or kmt2a on the long arm of chromosome 11 with mllt1 on the long arm of chromosome 19; and 4) duplication or lose of entire chromosomes, particularly chromosomes 9, 13, or 15. laboratory studies indicate that malignant pdc have a pathologically overactive nf-κb pathway that promotes their survival and production of various cytokines) that stimulate their own proliferation. presumably, these genetic abnormalities lead to the activation of the nf-κb pathway and/or other cellular activation pathways which promote the survival, proliferation, and/or other malignant phenotypic traits in pdc and thereby cause bpdcn.


== diagnosis ==
bpdcn is suggested by a biopsy of skin lesions which reveals the infiltration by medium-sized blast (i.e. immature) cells into the dermis while sparing the epidermis.  these cells exhibit irregular nuclei, fine chromatin, and at least one small nucleolus. such blast cells may also be observed in the circulation, bone marrow, or other tissues and  suggest bpdcn. however, the diagnosis of this disease requires determination that these cells are pdc blast cells rather than aml, t-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (tcll), or aggressive nk-cell leukemia (nkl) blast cells. various studies have offered similar but not identical criteria to make this determination. all studies agree that pdc should have a typical plasmacytoid morphology and express a particular profile of marker proteins as detected by immunoassay and/or flow cytometry. however, the studies disagree on which marker proteins to profile. one study's profile assayed 1) cd4, cd56, cd123 (i.e. interleukin-3 receptor, and tlc1, which are expressed on 80-100% of pdc but uncommon on aml, tcll, or nkl blasts); 2) cd2ap and clec4c which are unique to pdc; and 3) myeloperoxidase, lysozyme, cd34, cd14, cd11c, and cd163 which are unique to aml, tcll, or nkl blasts. two other studies recommended assaying somewhat different sets of marker proteins.


== treatment ==
there have been no controlled studies to define the optimal treatment for bpdcn. studies on small numbers of individuals with the disease have found that the standard chemotherapy regimens used for the initial induction treatments of aml, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and high-grade lymphoma give complete remission rates of 77%, 93%, and 80%, respectively, in childhood pbdn and 47%, 77%, and 53%, respectively, in adult pbdn. however, these remissions were short-lived: post-treatment mean times to relapse or death were 12 months for children and 6.8 months for adults. given these poor remission and survival rates, other treatments have been added to the initial treatment regimens. studies have shown that the addition of intrathecally administered drugs (administered directly into the spinal canal) as prophylaxis prolongs the period of cns-free disease and increases overall survival. hematopoietic stem cell transplantation following initial chemotherapy-induced remission also prolongs these remissions and, it is suggested, offers potential for curing the disease. (a graft-versus-leukemia effect may have contributed to the benefits seen after transplantation.) studies have not yet determined whether allogenic (i.e. taken from others) or autologous (i.e. taken from self) stem cells achieve better results, although one retrospective study in japan found that autologous stem cells gave significantly better overall and progression-free survival rates. a phase i clinical research study to test the safety and efficacy of a combination chemotherapy regimen consisting of methotrexate, l-asparaginase, idarubicin, and dexamethasone followed by allogenic or autologous bone marrow transplantation in 26 participants newly diagnosed with bpdcn is planned but not yet in its recruiting phase.while few studies have reported on the treatment of bpdcn that has recurred following initial therapy, donor lymphocyte infusions coupled with alternative chemotherapy treatments have induced second complete or partial remissions in a few patients.


=== tagraxofusp-erzs ===
tagraxofusp-erzs (trade name elzonris; formerly sl-401 and dt388-il3) was approved in the united states in december 2018 for the treatment of bpdcn.  tagraxofusp-erzs is a fusion protein consisting of interleukin 3 (i.e. il-3) fused to diphtheria toxin. the fusion protein readily kills cultured pdc by binding to their il-3 receptors to thereby gain entrance to the cells and then blocking these cells' protein synthesis (due to diphtheria toxin-mediated inhibition of eukaryotic elongation factor 2).


== prognosis ==
due to the high rates of recurrence following initial therapy and the short overall survival times of individuals with bpdcn, prognosis of the disease is poor. however, further study of treatment regimens that include intrathecal chemotherapy and hematological stem cell transplantation in initial treatment regimens (see previous section) and newer non-chemotherapeutic drug treatments (see next section) may improve this situation.


== research ==


=== ucart123 ===
ucart123 are chimeric t cell receptor-bearing cells, i.e. t lymphocytes engineered to bear a monoclonal antibody that directs them to attack and kill bpdcn cells. the intravenous infusion of these cells in patients with bpdcn is in phase 1 clinical trials but in september 2017, the federal drug administration suspended these because one patient developed a grade 5 (i.e. lethal) cytokine release syndrome (see ucart123#car-t cancer treatment). the suspension was lifted in november 2017 after the trial used reduced amounts of the cells and with additional conditions were applied. a new phase 1 clinical trial is now recruiting 76 new patients to study the safety and efficacy of ucar123 in treating bpdcn. the study began in june 2017 and is scheduled to end in december 2021.


=== venetoclax ===
bcl-2 is a cellular protein that can act to inhibit cell death due to apoptosis. the bcl-2 gene appears to be one of the most up-regulated (i.e. overactive) genes in bpdcn. venetoclax inhibits the apoptosis-inducing action of bcl-2 and proved active in treating two patients with relapsed or refractory bpdcn. a phase i clinical trial testing the safety and efficacy of the drug in bpdcn is planned but not yet in its recruiting phase.

calcium carbonate oral lozenge,drug,"streptococcus salivarius is a species of spherical, gram-positive, facultative anaerobic bacteria that is both catalase and oxidase negative. s. salivarius colonizes (usually in chains) the oral cavity and upper respiratory tract of humans just a few hours after birth, making further exposure to the bacteria harmless in most circumstances. the bacteria is considered an opportunistic pathogen, rarely finding its way into the bloodstream, where it has been implicated in cases of sepsis in people with neutropenia, (a deficiency in white blood cells).
s. salivarius has distinct characteristics when exposed to different environmental nutrients. for example, in the laboratory, if a growth medium is used that includes sucrose  then s. salivarius is able to use the sucrose to produce a capsule around itself. however, if sucrose is replaced by glucose as on a gyc (glucose, yeast extract, calcium carbonate) plate, s. salivarius is unable to make a capsule from the glucose.
more importantly, in the laboratory, s. salivarius can show a distinct clearing on gyc plates. this is because s. salivarius can ferment the glucose yielding lactic acid. next, the lactic acid actually reacts with the calcium carbonate in the gyc plate, resulting in zones of clearings on the plate.[1]


== role as a probiotic ==
some strains of s. salivarius are being trialed for their use as a probiotic in the prevention of oral infections. some strains of s. salivarius are found to produce blis (bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances) which are antimicrobial peptides. these peptides display interspecies inhibition, and inhibit streptococcus pyogenes (which causes strep throat infections). lozenges containing s. salivarius are marketed to support immunity against more virulent streptococcus strains. people with this strain of naturally occurring s. salivarius on their tongue have been shown to have fewer strep throat infections. this is also being investigated for its potential to prevent rheumatic heart disease which is also caused by s. pyogenes.
agglutination of streptococcus salivarius is often used in the diagnosis of atypical pneumonia caused by haemophilus influenzae


== subspecies ==
streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, also known as streptococcus thermophilus, is a subspecies of s. salivarius.

type strain of streptococcus salivarius at bacdive -  the bacterial diversity metadatabase"
ly-76 high reticulocyte,cell,"15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (also termed 15-hete, 15(s)-hete, and 15s-hete) is an eicosanoid, i.e. a metabolite of arachidonic acid. various cell types metabolize arachidonic acid to 15(s)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15(s)-hpete). this initial hydroperoxide product is extremely short-lived in cells: if not otherwise metabolized, it is rapidly reduced to 15(s)-hete. both of these metabolites, depending on the cell type which forms them, can be further metabolized to 15-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-oxo-ete), 5s,15s-dihydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (5(s),15(s)-dihete), 5-oxo-15(s)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-15(s)-hete, a subset of specialized pro-resolving mediators viz., the lipoxins, a class of pro-inflammatory mediators, the eoxins, and other products that have less well-defined activities and functions. thus, 15(s)-hete and 15(s)-hpete, in addition to having intrinsic biological activities, are key precursors to numerous biologically active derivatives.some cell types (e.g. platelets) metabolize arachidonic acid to the stereoisomer of 15(s)-hpete, 15(r)-hpete. both stereoisomers may also be formed as result of the metabolism of arachidonic acid by cellular microsomes or as a result of arachidonic acid auto-oxidation. similar to 15(s"")-hpetes, 15(r)-hpete may be rapidly reduced to 15(r)-hete. these r,s stereoisomers differ only in having their hydroxy residue in opposite orientations. while the two r stereoisomers are sometimes referred to as 15-hpete and 15-hete, proper usage should identify them as r  stereoisomers. 15(r)-hpete and 15(r)-hete lack some of the activity attributed to their s stereoisomers but can be further to metabolized to bioactive products viz., the 15(r) class of lipoxins (also termed epi-lipoxins).15(s)-hete, 15(s)-hpete, and many of their derivative metabolites are thought to have physiologically important functions. they appear to act as hormone-like autocrine and paracrine signalling agents that are involved in regulating inflammatory and perhaps other responses. clinically, drugs that are stable analogs, and therefore mimic the anti-inflammatory actions of the lipoxins and drugs that block the production or actions of the pro-inflammatory eoxins may prove useful for treating acute and chronic inflammatory disorders.


== nomenclature and stereoisomers ==
15(s)-hete is unambiguously designated by a shortened version of its iupac name viz., 15(s)-hydroxy-5z,8z,11z,13e-eicosatetraenoic acid. in this terminology s refers to the absolute configuration of the chirality of the hydroxy functional group at carbon position 15. its 15(r) enantiomer is designated 15(r)-hydroxy-5z,8z,11z,13e-eicosatetraenoic acid. z and e give the cis–trans isomerism about each double bond moiety at carbon positions 5, 8, 11, and 13 with z indicating cis and e indicating trans isomerism. both stereoisomers are produced from their corresponding s and r 15-hpete stereoisomers, i.e. 15(s)-hydroperoxy-5z,8z,11z,13e-eicosatetraenoic acid (15(s)-hpete) and (15r)-hydroperoxy-5z,8z,11z,13e-eicosatetraenoic acid (15(r)-hpete).


== production ==
human cells release arachidonic acid (i.e. 5z,8z,11z,14z-eicosatetraenoic acid) from its storage site in phospholipids by reactions that involve phospholipase c and/or lipase enzymes. this release is stimulated or enhanced by cell stimulation. the freed arachidonic acid is then converted to 15-hydroperoxy/hydroxy products by one or more of the following five pathways.
15-lipoxygenase-1: cells metabolize arachidonic acid with 15-lipoxygenase-1 (i.e., 15-lo-1, alox15) to form 15(s)-hpete as a major product and 12(s)-hydroperoxy-5z,8z,10e,15z-eicosatetraenoic acid (12(s)-hpete) and 14(s),15(s)-trans-oxido-5z,8z,11z-14,15-leukotriene a4 as minor products; 15(s)-hpete and 12(s)-hpete are rapidly converted to 15(s)-hete and 12(s)-hydroxy-5z,8z,10e,15z-eicosatetraenoic acid (12(s)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid), (i.e. 12(s)-hete), respectively, or further metabolized through other enzyme pathways; 14(s),15(s)-trans-oxido-5z,8z,11z-14,15-leukotriene a4 is metabolized by 15-lo-1 to various isomers of 8,15(s)-dihydroxy-5s,8s,11z,13s-eicosatetraenoic acids, e.g. 8,15(s)-ltb4's.15-lipoxygenase-2: cells also used 15-lipoxygenase 2 (i.e. 15-lox-2 or alox15b) to make 15(s)-hpete and 15(s)-hete. however this enzyme has a preference for metabolizing linoleic acid rather than  arachidonic acid. it therefore forms linoleic acid metabolites (e.g. 13-hydoxyperoxy/hydroxy-octadecadienoic and 9-hydroperoxy/hydroxyl-octadecadienoic acids) in greater amounts than 15(s)-hpete and 15(s)-hete. 15-lox-2 also differs from 15-lox-1 in that it does not make 12(s)-hpete or the leukotriene a4 isomer cited above.cycloxygenase: cells can use prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1 (i.e. cyclooxygenenase-1 or cox-1) and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (cox-2) to metabolize arachidonic acid primarily to prostaglandins but also to small amounts of 11(r)-hete and a racemic mixture of 15-hetes composed of ~22% 15(r)-hete and ~78% 15(s)-hete.  when pretreated with aspirin, however, cox-1 is inactive while cox-2 attacks arachidonic acid to produce almost exclusively 15(r)-hete along with its presumed precursor 15(r)-hpete.microsome metabolism: human and rat microsomal cytochrome p450s, e.g. cyp2c19, metabolize arachidonic acid to a racemic mixture of 15-hetes, i.e., 15(r,s)-hetes, >90% of which is the 15(r) stereoisomer.autoxidation: the spontaneous and non-enzymatically-induced autoxidation of arachidonic acid yields 15(r,s)-hydroperoxy-5z,8z,11z,13e-eicosatetraenoic acids. this non-enzymatic reaction is promoted in cells undergoing oxidative stress. cells forming this racemic mixture of 15-hydroperoxy products may convert then to 15(r,s)-hetes and other products. however, the uncontrolled overproduction of the 15-hydroperoxy products may react with other elements to produce cell injury.


== further metabolism ==
the newly formed products formed by the pathways cited in the previous section are bioactive but may also flow into down-stream pathways to form other metabolites with a different sets of bioactivity. the initially formed 15(s)-hpete may be further metabolized by its parent cell or pass it to nearby cell by a process termed transcellular metabolism.
15(s)-hpete may be: 

rapidly reduced to 15(s)-hete by ubiquitous cellular peroxidase reactions including those possessed by prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase-1 and -2, prostacyclin synthase, thromboxane synthase, and vaiousglutathione peroxidases.
acylated into membrane phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylinositols and  phosphatidylethanolamine.  the 15(s)-hpete is bound primarily at the sn-2 position of these phospholipids (see phospholipase) and may be reduced to 15(s)-hete thereby forming their 15(s)-hete-bound phospholipoid analogs. phosphotidylinositol phospholipids with 15(s)-hete in the sn-2 position can be attacked by phospholipase c to form corresponding diglycerides with 15(s)-hete at theirsn-2 positions.
metabolized by 15-lo-1 to its 14,15-trans-epoxide, 14,15-trans-epoxide oxido-5z,8z,10e,13e-eicosatetraenoic acid (i.e., eoxin a4 or exa4), and thereafter to 14(r)-glutothionyl-15(s)hydroxy-5z,8z,10e,13e-eicosatetraenoic acid (i.e. eoxin c4 or exc4) by leukotriene c4 synthase.  exc4 contains glutathione (i.e. γ-l-glutamyl-l-cysteinylglycine) bound in the r configuration to carbon 14.  exc4 is further metabolized by removal of the γ-l-glutamyl residue to form exd4 which is in turn further metabolized by removal of the glycine residue to form exe4.  these metabolic transformations are similar to those in the pathway that metabolizes arachidonic acid to [[lta4]], [[ltc4]], [[ltd4]], and [[lte4]] and presumed to be conducted by the same enzymes   (eoxins are also termed 14,15-leukotrienes or 14,15-lts).
metabolized alternatively by 15-lo-1 to various 8,15-dihetes including the two 8(r) and 8(s) diastereomers of 8,15(s)-dihydroxy-5,9,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid (8,15-leukotrienes b4) and to two isomeric erythro-14,15-dihydroxy-5-cis-8,10,12-eicosatetraenoic acids (14,15-leukotrienes b4).
metabolized by 15-lox-2 to 11(s)-hydroxy-14(s),15(s)-epoxy-5(z),8(z),12(e)-eicosatrienoic acid and 13(r)-hydroxy-14(s),15(s)-epoxy-5(z),8(z),11(z)-eicosatrienoic acid; these two products are novel hepoxilins produced by alox15 rather than alox12, the enzyme responsible for making the various other hepoxilins in humans.  the two novel hepoxilins are termed respectively 14,15-hxa3 and 14,15-hxb3. 14,15-hxa3 can be further metabolized by glutathione transferases to 11(s),15(s)-dihydroxy-14(r)-glutathionyl--(5z),8(z),12(e)eicosatrienoic acid (14,15-hxa3c) which is then further metabolized to 11(s),15(s)-dihydroxy-14(r)-cysteinyl-glycyl-(5z),8(z),12(e)eicosatrienoic acid (14,15-hxa3d).
isomerized to 15(s)-hydroxy-11,12-cis-epoxy-5z,8z,13e-eicosatrienoic acid (i.e., 15-h-11,12-eeta) by a hydroperoxide isomerase activity and then to 11,12,15-trihydroxy-5z,8z12e-eicosatrienoic acid (i.e. 11,12,15-theta) and 11,14,15-trihydroxy-5z,8z,12e-eicosatrienoic acid (i.e., 11,14,15-theta) by a soluble epoxide hydrolase activity or, by acid in a non-enzymatic reaction (the r, s configuration of the hydroxy residues in the latter two metabolites has not been defined).
isomerized to threo and erythro diastereoisomers of 13-hydroxy-14,15-cis-epoxy-5z,8z,11z-eicosatrienoic acid (i.e., 15-h-11,12-eeta) by a hydroperoxide isomerase activity, possibly a cytochrome p450, i.e. cyp2j2.
metabolized by cytochrome p450 (cyp) enzymes such as cyp1a1, cyp1a2, cyp1b1, and cyp2s1 to 15-oxo-ete.
metabolized in skin epidermis by epidermis-type lipoxygenase 3 (elox3, encoded by the aloxe3 gene) to make two products, hepoxilin a3 (hxa3, i.e., 13r-hydroxy-14s,15s-epoxy-5z,8z,11z-eicosatetraenoic acid) and 15-oxo-ete).
converted to its 14,15-epoxide derivative, eoxin a4, and further metabolized to eoxin c4, eoxin d4, and eoxin e4 (there is no eoxin b4).
degraded non-enzymatically to various cell-injuring electrophiles such as 4-hydroxy-2(e)-nonenal and 4-oxo-2(e)-nonenal.15(s)-hete may be:

oxidized to its keto analog, 15-oxo-ete, by the same enzyme that converts prostaglandins of the a, e, and f series to their 15-keto analogs viz., nad+-dependent 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase; 15-oxo-ete, similar to 15(s)-hete, may be acylated into membrane phosphatidylethanolamaine or, similar to 15(s)-hpete, conjugated with glutathione to form a 13-cysteinyl-glycyl-glutamine adduct viz., 13-glutatione,15-oxo-5(s),8(z),11(e)-eicosatrienoic acid; the latter metabolite is attacked by γ-glutamyl-transferase to form 13-cysteinyl-glycine,15-oxo-5(s),8(z),11(e)-eicosatrienoic acid.
acylated into membrane phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylethanolamine. phospholipid products contain this 15(s)-hete most likely at the sn-2 position. 15(s)-hete-containing-phospholipids may also be made directly by the action of 15-lo-1 on membrane phosphatidylinositols or phosphatidylethanolamines containing arachidonic acid at the sn-2 positions.  the phosphatidylethanolamine-bound 15-hete may be converted to phosphatidylethanolamine-bound 15-oxo-ete.
oxygenated by 5-lipoxygenase (alox5 to form its 5,6-trans epoxide derivative which may then rearrange to the lipoxins (lx), lxa4 (i.e. 5(s),6(r),15(s)-trihydroxy-7e,9e,11z,13e-eicosatetraenoic acid) and lxb4 (i.e., 5(s),14(r),15(s)-trihydroxy-6e,8z,10e,12e-eicosatetraenoic acid). or to 5(s),15(s)-dihydroperoxy-6e,8z,11z,13e-eicosatetraenoate (i.e., (5(s),15(s)-dihete). 5(s),15(s)-dihete may then be oxidized to 5-oxo-15(s)-hydroxy-6e,8z,11z,13e-eicosatetraenoate (i.e., 5-oxo-15(s)-hydroxy-ete). the latter two metabolites may also be made by 15-lo's metabolism of 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (i.e. 5-hete) and 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid) (i.e. 5-oxo-ete), respectively.15(r)-hpete may be:

reduced to 15(r)-hete by the same pathway that reduces 5(s)-hpete to 15(s)-hete.
similar to 15(s)-hpete, subject to decomposition to form various bifuctional potentially toxic electrophiles such as 4-hydroxy-2(e)-nonenal and 4-oxo-2(e)-nonenal.15(r)-hete may be:

similar to 15(s)-hete, oxidized by nad-dependent 5-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase to form 15-oxo-ete which product can be converted its 13-cysteinyl-glycyl-glutamyl and then 13-cysteinyl-glycine products as described above for 5(s)-hete.
similar to 15(s)-hete, oxygenated by alox5 to form its 5,6-oxido derivative which then rearranges to the 15(r) diastereomers of lxa4 and (lxb4 viz., 15-epic lxa4 5(s),6(r),15(r)-trihydroxy-7e,9e,11z,13e-eicosatetraenoic acid) and 15-epi-lxb4 (i.e., 5(s),14(r),15(s)-trihydroxy-6e,8z,10e,12e-eicosatetraenoic acid, respectively.


== activities ==


=== 15(s)-hpete and 15(s)-hete ===
most studies have analyzed the action of 15(s)-hete but not that of its less stable precursor 15(s)-hpete.  since this precursor is rapidly converted to 15(s)-hete in cells, it is likely that the two metabolites share similar activities. in many studies, however, is not clear that these activities reflect their intrinsic action or reflect their conversion to the metabolites sited above.
15(s)-hpete and 15(s)-hete bind to and activate the g protein-coupled receptor, leukotriene b4 receptor 2, i.e. blt2. this receptor activation may mediate, at least in part, certain cell-stimulating activities of the two metabolites. blt2 may be responsible in part or whole for mediating the growth-promoting and anti-apoptosis (i.e. anti-cell death) activities of 15(s)-hete in cultured human breast cancer cells; human cancer colon cells, human hepatocellular hepg2 and smmc7721 cancer cells;  mouse 3t3 cells (a fibroblast cell line); rat pa adventitia fibroblasts; baby hamster kidney cells; and diverse types of vascular endothelial cells.  these growth-stimulating effects could contribute to the progression of the cited cancer types in animal models or even humans and the excess fibrosis that causes the narrowing of pulmonary arteries in hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension or narrowing of portal arteries in the portal hypertension accompanying liver cirrhosis.  15(s)-hete may also act through blt2 to stimulate an immediate contractile response in rat pulmonary arteries and its angiogenic effect on human umbilical and dermal vascular endothelial cells.
15(s)-hpete and 15(s)-hete also directly bind with and activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.  this activation may contribute to the ability of 15(s)-hete to inhibit the growth of cultured human prostate cancer pc-3, lncap, and du145 cell lines and non-malignant human prostate cells; lung adenocarcinoma a549 cells; human colorectal cancer cells; corneal epithelial cells; and jurkat t-cell leukemia cells.  the decline in the level of 15(s)-hpete-forming enzymes and consequential fall in cellular 15-hete production that occurs in human prostate cancer cells may be one mechanism by which this and perhaps other human cancer cells (e.g. those of the colon, rectum, and lung) avoid the apoptosis-inducing actions of 15(s)-hpete and/or 15(s)-hete and thereby proliferate and spread.  in this scenario,  15(s)-hete and one of its formaing enzymes, particularly 15-lox-2, appear to act as tumor suppressors.
some of the inhibitory effects of 15(s)-hpete and 15(s)-hete, particularly when induced by high concentrations (e.g. >1-10 micromolar), may be due to a less specific mechanism: 15(s)-hpete and to a lesser extent 15(s)-hete induce the generation of reactive oxygen species.  these species trigger cells to activate their death programs, i.e. apoptosis, and/or are openly toxic to the cells.  15(s)-hpete and 15(s)-hete inhibit angiogenesis and the growth of cultured human chronic myelogenous leukemia k-562 cells by a mechanism that is associated with the production of reactive oxygen species.several bifunctional electrophilic breakdown products of 15(s)-hpete, e.g. 4-hydroxy-2(e)-nonenal, 4-hydroperoxy-2(e)-nonenal, 4-oxo-2(e)-nonenal, and cis-4,5-epoxy-2(e)-decanal, are mutagens in mammalian cells and thereby may contripute to the development and/or progression of human cancers.


=== 15(r)-hete ===
similar to 15(s)-hpete and 15(s)-hete and with similar potency, 15(r)-hete binds with and activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.  the precursor of 15(r)-hete, 15(r)-hpete may, similar to 15(s)-hpete, break down to the mutagenic products 4-hydroxy-2(e)-nonenal, 4-hydroperoxy-2(e)-nonenal, 4-oxo-2(e)-nonenal, and cis-4,5-epoxy-2(e)-decanal and therefore be involved in cancer development and/or progression.


=== 15-oxo-ete ===
in cultured human monocytes of the thp1 cell line, 15-oxo-ete inactivates ikkβ (also known as ikk2) thereby blocking this cell's nf-κb-mediated pro-inflammatory responses (e.g.,. lipopolysaccharide-induced production of tnfα, interleukin 6, and il1b) while concurrently activating anti-oxidant responses upregulated through the anti-oxidant response element (are) by forcing cytosolic keap1 to release nfe2l2 which then moves to the nucleus, binds are, and induces production of, e.g. hemoxygenase-1, nadph-quinone oxidoreductase, and possibly glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier.  by these actions, 15-oxo-ete may dampen inflammatory and/or oxidative stress responses.  in a cell-free system, 15-oxo-ete is a moderately potent (ic50=1 μm) inhibitor of 12-lipoxygenase but not other human lipoxygenases.  this effect could also have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects by blocking the formation of 12-hete and hepoxilins.  15-oxo-ete is an example of an  α,β unsaturated ketone electrophile.  these ketones are highly reactive with nucleophiles, adducting to, for example, the cysteines in transcription and transcription-related regulatory factors and enzymes to form their alkylated and thereby often inactivated products.  it is presumed that the preceding activities of 15-oxo-ete reflect its adduction to the indicated elements.  15-oxo-ete, at 2-10 μm, also inhibits the proliferation of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells and lovo human colorectal cancer cells  and at the extremely high concentration of 100 μm inhibits the proliferation of cultured mba-md-231 and mcf7 breast cancer cells as well as skov3 ovarian cancer cells.  they may use a similar ""protein-adduction"" mechanism; if so the target protein(s) for these effects have not been defined or even suggested.  this 15-oxo-ete action may prove to inhibit the remodeling of blood vessels and reduce the growth of the cited cell types and cancers.  at sub-micromolar concentrations, 15-oxo-ete has weak chemotaxis activity for human monocytes and could serve to recruit this white blood cell into inflammatory responses.


=== 5-oxo-15(s)-hydroxy-ete ===
5-oxo-15(s)-hydroxy-ete is properly a member of the 5-hete family of agonists which binds to the oxoeicosanoid receptor 1, a g protein-coupled receptor, to activate its various target cells.  as such, it is a potent stimulator of leukocytes, particularly eosinophils, as well as other oxe1-bearing cells including mda-mb-231, mcf7, and skov3 cancer cells (see 5-hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid and 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid).  
it also binds with and activates pparγ and thereby can stimulate or inhibit cells independently of oxe1.


=== lipoxins ===
lxa4, lxb4, at-lxa4, and at-lxb4 are specialized proresolving mediators, i.e. they potently inhibit the progression and contribute to the resolution of diverse inflammatory and allergic reactions (see specialized proresolving mediators#lipoxins and lipoxins).


=== eoxins ===
eoxin a4, eoxin c4, eoxin d4, and eoxin e4 and analogs of leukotriene a4, c4, leukotriene d4, and e4. formation of the leukotrienes is initiated by 5-lipoxygenase metabolism of arachidonic acid to form a 5,6-epoxide viz, leukotriene a4; the latter metabolite is then converted to c4, d4, and e4 in succession. formation of the eoxins is initiated by a 15-lipoxyenase-mediated metabolism of arachiconic acid to a 14,15-epoxide, eoxin a4 followed by its serial conversion to epoxins c4, d4, and e4 using the same pathways and enzymes that metabolize leukotriene a4 to its down-stream products. preliminary studies have found that the eoxins have pro-inflammatory actions, suggest that they are involved in severe asthma, aspirin-induced asthma attacks, and perhaps other allergic reactions. the production of eoxins by reed-sternburg cells has also led to suggestion that they are involve in the lymphoma of hodgkins disease. drugs blocking the 15-lipoxygenases may be useful for inhibiting inflammation by reducing the production of the eoxins.

smw beat the champ television championship,non_science,"the smw ""beat the champ"" television championship was the secondary singles championship for the smoky mountain wrestling (smw) professional wrestling promotion. the title was created in 1992 and was active until smw closed on november 26, 1995. the storyline concept of the title was that the champion would defend his title every week against a ""randomly drawn"" opponent. for each successful defense of the belt, the wrestler won $1,000, and if the champion could win five title matches in a row, including the title win, then the title was vacated and the champion received a $5,000 bonus. in reality, the opponents were predetermined, and the winner never received the bonus. moreover, the title was never represented by a belt. because the championship is a professional wrestling championship, it is not won or lost competitively but instead by the decision of the bookers of a wrestling promotion. the championship is awarded after the chosen team ""wins"" a match to maintain the illusion that professional wrestling is a competitive sport.

proteolipid protein 2 isoform h2 (human),protein,"proteolipid protein 1 (plp1) is a form of myelin proteolipid protein (plp). mutations in plp1 are associated with pelizaeus–merzbacher disease.  it is a 4 transmembrane domain protein which is proposed to bind other copies of itself on the extracellular side of the membrane. in a myelin sheath, as the layers of myelin wraps come together, plp will bind itself and tightly hold the cellular membranes together.
this gene encodes a transmembrane proteolipid protein that is the predominant myelin protein present in the central nervous system (cns). the encoded protein functions in myelination. this protein may play a role in the compaction, stabilization, and maintenance of myelin sheaths, as well as in oligodendrocyte development and axonal survival. mutations associated with this gene cause x-linked pelizaeus–merzbacher disease and spastic paraplegia type 2. two transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified for this gene.in melanocytic cells plp1 gene expression may be regulated by mitf.

nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety x motif 17 isoform m2 (mouse),protein,"evi5l (ecotropic viral integration site 5-like) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the evi5l gene. evi5l is a member of the ras superfamily of monomeric guanine nucleotide-binding (g) proteins, and functions as a gtpase-activating protein (gap) with a broad specificity. measurement of in vitro rab-gap activity has shown that evi5l has significant rab2a- and rab10-gap activity.


== gene ==
the evi5l gene is 34,701 base pairs long and has an unprocessed mrna that is 3,756 nucleotides in length. it consists of 19 exons that encode for an 805 amino acid protein.


=== locus ===
evi5l is located on the short arm (p) of chromosome 19 in region 1, band 3, and sub-band 2 (19p13.2) starting at 7,830,275 base pairs and ending at 7,864,976 base pairs. it is encoded for on the plus strand. it is located near the clec4m (c-type lectin domain family 4, member m) gene, which is involved in peptide antigen transport.


== homology and evolution ==


=== homologous domains ===
evi5l contains a rab-gap tbc domain, which is involved with regulating membrane trafficking by cycling between inactive (gdp-bound) and active (gtp-bound) conformations. it also has the apolipophorin-iii and tetratricopeptide repeat (tpr) domains. apolipophorin-iii play vital roles in the transport of lipids and lipoprotein metabolism, while tpr mediates protein-protein interactions and the assembly of multi protein complexes. these three domains are highly conserved in evi5l orthologs.


=== paralogs ===
there are 7 moderately related proteins in humans that are paralogous to the rab-gap tbc domain of evi5l. all of these proteins are in the guanosine nucleotide-binding protein family


=== orthologs ===
there are 63 orthologs of evi5l that have been identified including mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish.  evi5l is highly conserved among its orthologs but is not present in insects, plants, bacteria, archea or protists.


=== homologs ===

the following table lists the homologs of evi5l:


== protein ==
the protein of evi5l consists of 805 amino acid residues. the molecular weight of the mature protein is 92.5 kdal with an isoelectric point of 5.05. evi5l has an unusually large amount of glutamic acid residues, compared to similar proteins. most of the protein is neutral, with no positive charge, negative charge, or mixed charge clusters. it has a very small negative hydrophobicity (-0.597019). evi5l is a soluble protein that localizes in the nucleus. it contains no signal peptide, no mitochondrial targeting motifs and no peroxisomal targeting signal in the c-terminus. there is no transmembrane domain in evi5l.


=== isoforms ===
evi5l has two isoforms produced by alternative splicing. isoform 2 is missing in-frame exon 11, making it shorter (794 amino acids).


=== post-translational modifications ===
post translational modifications of evi5l that are evolutionarily conserved in majority of the orthologs include glycosylation (c-mannosylation), glycation, phosphorylation (non-kinase and kinase specific), and sumoylation. there is also one leucine-rich nuclear export signal.


=== secondary structure ===
the entire secondary structure of evi5l is made up of alpha helices, with no beta sheets present. this is also true for evi5ls closest structural paralog, rabgap1l.


== expression ==


=== promoter ===
the predicted promoter for the evi5l gene spans 664 base pairs from 7,910,867 to 7,911,530 with a predicted transcriptional start site that is 114 base pairs and spans from 7,911,346 to 7,911,460.  the promoter region and beginning of the evi5l gene (7,910,997 to 7,911,843) is not conserved past primates.  this region was used to determine transcription factor interactions.
some of the main transcription factors predicted to bind to the promoter includes: activator-, mediator- and tbp-dependent core promoter element for rna polymerase ii transcription from tata-less promoters, p53 tumor suppressor, brachyury gene, mesoderm developmental factor, egr/nerve growth factor induced protein c & related factors, and gli zinc finger family.


=== expression ===
expression data from expressed sequence tag mapping, microarray and in situ hybridization shows evi5l has ubiquitously low expression. however, it has slightly higher expression in the testis and fetal brain.


== function and biochemistry ==
the exact function of evi5l is unknown. given this, the paralogs of the gene are associated with starvation-induced autophagosome formation and trafficking and translocation of glut4-containing vesicles. therefore, evi5l is predicted to target endocytic vesicles.


== interacting proteins ==

evi5l has been shown to interact with nudt18 (nucleoside diphosphate linked moiety x)-type motif 18 and srpk2 (serine/threonine-protein kinase 2). nudt18 is a member of the nudix hydrolase family. nudix hydrolases eliminate potentially toxic nucleotide metabolites from the cell and regulate the concentrations and availability of many different nucleotide substrates, cofactors, and signaling molecules. srpk2 is a serine/arginine rich protein-specific kinase which specifically phosphorylates its substrates at serine residues located in regions rich in arginine/serine dipeptides, known as rs domains and is involved in the phosphorylation of sr splicing factors and the regulation of splicing.


== clinical significance ==
zebrafish deficient for rab23 or its gtpase-activating protein, evi5l, exhibit abnormal heart formation. this is attributed to the requirement of rab23 in the differentiation of cardiac progenitor cells. rab23 is required for normal development of the brain, spinal cord and heart, and without evi5l to activate rab23, abnormal formation of these organs ensues.

post-operative and post-radiation nausea and vomiting
is a possible therapy for nausea and vomiting due to acute or chronic medical illness or acute gastroenteritis
unlike most other 5ht3 antagonists, data is lacking for use of dolasetron with aprepitant in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (cinv).
it is also sometimes used as an antiemetic (anti-vomiting medication) in veterinary medicine for dogs and cats.

dolasetron is a well-tolerated drug with few side effects. headache, dizziness, and constipation are the most commonly reported side effects associated with its use. there is a potential for prolonging of the qt interval to occur as well. there have been no significant drug interactions reported with this drug's use. dolasetron is broken down by the liver's cytochrome p450 system and has little effect on the metabolism of other drugs broken down by this system.
intravenous dolasetron is contraindicated in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (cinv). doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide are as emetogenic as cisplatin, and preventive drugs should always be considered. the 5ht3 agonists are the mainstays of prevention and are frequently used in combination with other drugs such as corticosteroids and the nk1 receptor antagonist aprepitant. however, the fda recently issued a drug communication stating that the injection form of dolasetron, a 5ht3 agonist, should no longer be used in adult or pediatric patients with cinv. dolasetron injection can increase the risk of developing torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal abnormal heart rhythm. patients with underlying heart conditions or existing heart rate or rhythm problems are at increased risk. although the oral form of this agent can still be used, careful monitoring and correction of potassium and magnesium levels should be initiated prior to and during treatment. in addition, in older patients and in patients with heart failure, a slow heart rate, underlying cardiac disease, and those with renal impairment, monitoring with electrocardiography is indicated when this drug is used. congenital long-qt syndrome and drugs that prolong the pr or qrs interval are contraindications to dolasetron therapy. dolasetron injection may still be used for the prevention and treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting, per food and drug administration guidelines.

cyclin-dependent kinase 10 isoform h3 (human),protein,"cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) are the families of protein kinases first discovered for their role in regulating the cell cycle. they are also involved in regulating transcription, mrna processing, and the differentiation of nerve cells. they are present in all known eukaryotes, and their regulatory function in the cell cycle has been evolutionarily conserved. in fact, yeast cells can proliferate normally when their cdk gene has been replaced with the homologous human gene. cdks are relatively small proteins, with molecular weights ranging from 34 to 40 kda, and contain little more than the kinase domain. by definition, a cdk binds a regulatory protein called a cyclin. without cyclin, cdk has little kinase activity; only the cyclin-cdk complex is an active kinase but its activity can be typically further modulated by phosphorylation and other binding proteins, like p27. cdks phosphorylate their substrates on serines and threonines, so they are serine-threonine kinases. the consensus sequence for the phosphorylation site in the amino acid sequence of a cdk substrate is [s/t*]px[k/r], where s/t* is the phosphorylated serine or threonine, p is proline, x is any amino acid, k is lysine, and r is arginine.


== types ==


== cdks and cyclins in the cell cycle ==
most of the known cyclin-cdk complexes regulate the progression through the cell cycle. animal cells contain at least nine cdks, four of which, cdk1, 2, 3, and 4, are directly involved in cell cycle regulation. in mammalian cells, cdk1, with its partners cyclin a2 and b1, alone can drive the cell cycle. another one, cdk7, is involved indirectly as the cdk-activating kinase. cyclin-cdk complexes phosphorylate substrates appropriate for the particular cell cycle phase. cyclin-cdk complexes of earlier cell-cycle phase help activate cyclin-cdk complexes in later phase.

cdk12; cyclin l

== regulation of activity ==
cdk levels remain relatively constant throughout the cell cycle and most regulation is post-translational. most knowledge of cdk structure and function is based on cdks of s. pombe (cdc2), s. cerevisiae (cdc28), and vertebrates (cdc2 and cdk2). the four major mechanisms of cdk regulation are cyclin binding, cak phosphorylation, regulatory inhibitory phosphorylation, and binding of cdk inhibitory subunits (ckis).


=== cyclin binding ===
the active site, or atp-binding site, of all kinases is a cleft between a small amino-terminal lobe and a larger carboxy-terminal lobe. the structure of human cdk2 revealed that cdks have a modified atp-binding site that can be regulated by cyclin binding. phosphorylation by cdk-activating kinase (cak) at thr 161 on the t-loop increases the complex activity. without cyclin, a flexible loop called the activation loop or t-loop blocks the cleft, and the position of several key amino acid residues is not optimal for atp-binding. with cyclin, two alpha helices change position to permit atp binding. one of them, the l12 helix that comes just before the t-loop in the primary sequence, becomes a beta strand and helps rearrange the t-loop, so it no longer blocks the active site. the other alpha helix called the pstaire helix rearranges and helps change the position of the key amino acid residues in the active site.there is considerable specificity in which cyclin binds with cdk. furthermore, cyclin binding determines the specificity of the cyclin-cdk complex for particular substrates. cyclins can directly bind the substrate or localize the cdk to a subcellular area where the substrate is found. substrate specificity of s cyclins is imparted by the hydrophobic batch (centered on the mrail sequence), which has affinity for substrate proteins that contain a hydrophobic rxl (or cy) motif. cyclin b1 and b2 can localize cdk1 to the nucleus and the golgi, respectively, through a localization sequence outside the cdk-binding region.


=== phosphorylation ===

full kinase activity requires an activating phosphorylation on a threonine adjacent to the cdk's active site. the identity of the cdk-activating kinase (cak) that performs this phosphorylation varies across the model organisms. the timing of this phosphorylation varies as well. in mammalian cells, the activating phosphorylation occurs after cyclin binding. in yeast cells, it occurs before cyclin binding. cak activity is not regulated by known cell-cycle pathways and cyclin binding is the limiting step for cdk activation.unlike activating phosphorylation, cdk inhibitory phosphorylation is vital for regulation of the cell cycle. various kinases and phosphatases regulate their phosphorylation state. one of the kinases that place the tyrosine phosphate is wee1, a kinase conserved in all eukaryotes. fission yeast also contains a second kinase mik1 that can phosphorylate the tyrosine. vertebrates contain a different second kinase called myt1 that is related to wee1 but can phosphorylate both the threonine and the tyrosine. phosphatases from the cdc25 family dephosphorylate both the threonine and the tyrosine.


=== cdk inhibitors ===
a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (cki) is a protein that interacts with a cyclin-cdk complex to block kinase activity, usually during g1 or in response to signals from the environment or from damaged dna. in animal cells, there are two major cki families: the ink4 family and the cip/kip family. the ink4 family proteins are strictly inhibitory and bind cdk monomers. crystal structures of cdk6-ink4 complexes show that ink4 binding twists the cdk to distort cyclin binding and kinase activity. the cip/kip family proteins bind both the cyclin and the cdk of a complex and can be inhibitory or activating. cip/kip family proteins activate cyclin d and cdk4 or cdk6 complexes by enhancing complex formation.in yeast and drosophila, ckis are strong inhibitors of s- and m-cdk, but do not inhibit g1/s-cdks. during g1, high levels of ckis prevent cell cycle events from occurring out of order, but do not prevent transition through the start checkpoint, which is initiated through g1/s-cdks. once the cell cycle is initiated, phosphorylation by early g1/s-cdks leads to destruction of ckis, relieving inhibition on later cell cycle transitions. in mammalian cells, the cki regulation works differently. mammalian protein p27 (dacapo in drosophila) inhibits g1/s- and s-cdks, but does not inhibit s- and m-cdks.


=== suk1 or cks ===
the cdks directly involved in the regulation of the cell cycle associate with small, 9- to 13-kilodalton proteins called suk1 or cks. these proteins are required for cdk function, but their precise role is unknown.
cks1 binds the carboxy lobe of the cdk, and recognizes phosphorylated residues. it may help the cyclin-cdk complex with substrates that have multiple phosphorylation sites by increasing affinity for the substrate.


=== non-cyclin activators ===


==== viral cyclins ====
viruses can encode proteins with sequence homology to cyclins. one much-studied example is k-cyclin (or v-cyclin) from kaposi sarcoma herpes virus (see kaposi’s sarcoma), which activates cdk6. viral cyclin-cdk complexes have different substrate specificities and regulation sensitivities.


==== cdk5 activators ====
the proteins p35 and p39 activate cdk5. although they lack cyclin sequence homology, crystal structures show that p35 folds in a similar way as the cyclins. however, activation of cdk5 does not require activation loop phosphorylation.


==== ringo/speedy ====
proteins with no homology to the cyclin family can be direct activators of cdks.  one family of such activators is the ringo/speedy family, which was originally discovered in xenopus. all five members discovered so far directly activate cdk1 and cdk2, but the ringo/speedy-cdk2 complex recognizes different substrates than cyclin a-cdk2 complex.


== history ==
leland h. hartwell, r. timothy hunt, and paul m. nurse received the 2001 nobel prize in physiology or medicine for their complete description of cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase mechanisms, which are central to the regulation of the cell cycle.


== medical significance ==

cdks are considered a potential target for anti-cancer medication. if it is possible to selectively interrupt the cell cycle regulation in cancer cells by interfering with cdk action, the cell will die. at present, some cdk inhibitors such as seliciclib are undergoing clinical trials. although it was originally developed as a potential anti-cancer drug, seliciclib has also proven to induce apoptosis in neutrophil granulocytes, which mediate inflammation. this means that novel drugs for treatment of chronic inflammation diseases such as arthritis and cystic fibrosis could be developed.
flavopiridol (alvocidib) is the first cdk inhibitor to be tested in clinical trials after being identified in an anti-cancer agent screen in 1992. it competes for the atp site of the cdks. palbociclib and abemaciclib have been approved for the management of hormone receptor (estrogen receptor/progestogen receptor) expressing  metastatic breast cancer in combination with endocrine therapy.more research is required, however, because disruption of the cdk-mediated pathway has potentially serious consequences; while cdk inhibitors seem promising, it has to be determined how side-effects can be limited so that only target cells are affected. as such diseases are currently treated with glucocorticoids, which have often serious side-effects, even a minor success would be an improvement.complications of developing a cdk drug include the fact that many cdks are not involved in the cell cycle, but other processes such as transcription, neural physiology, and glucose homeostasis.

jejunal goblet cell,cell,"the jejunum is the second part of the small intestine in humans and most higher vertebrates, including mammals, reptiles, and birds.  its lining is specialised for the absorption by enterocytes of small nutrient molecules which have been previously digested by enzymes in the duodenum.
the jejunum lies between the duodenum and the ileum and is considered to start at the suspensory muscle of the duodenum, a location called the duodenojejunal flexure. the division between the jejunum and ileum is not anatomically distinct. in adult humans, the small intestine is usually 6–7 metres (20–23 ft) long (post mortem), about two-fifths of which (about 2.5 m (8.2 ft)) is the jejunum.


== structure ==

the interior surface of the jejunum—which is exposed to ingested food—is covered in finger–like projections of mucosa, called villi, which increase the surface area of tissue available to absorb nutrients from ingested foodstuffs. the epithelial cells which line these villi have microvilli. the transport of nutrients across epithelial cells through the jejunum and ileum includes the passive transport of sugar fructose and the active transport of amino acids, small peptides, vitamins, and most glucose. the villi in the jejunum are much longer than in the duodenum or ileum.
the ph in the jejunum is usually between 7 and 8 (neutral or slightly alkaline).
the jejunum and the ileum are suspended by mesentery which gives the bowel great mobility within the abdomen. it also contains circular and longitudinal smooth muscle which helps to move food along by a process known as peristalsis.


=== histology ===
the jejunum contains very few brunner's glands (found in the duodenum) or peyer's patches (found in the ileum). however, there are a few jejunal lymph nodes suspended in its mesentery. the jejunum has many large circular folds in its submucosa called plicae circulares that which increase the surface area for nutrient absorption. the plicae circulares are best developed in the jejunum.
there is no line of demarcation between the jejunum and the ileum.  however, there are subtle histological differences:

the jejunum has less fat inside its mesentery than the ileum.
the jejunum is typically of larger diameter than the ileum.
the villi of the jejunum look like long, finger-like projections, and are a histologically identifiable structure.
while the length of the entire intestinal tract contains lymphoid tissue, only the ileum has abundant peyer's patches, which are unencapsulated lymphoid nodules that contain large numbers of lymphocytes and immune cells, like microfold cells.
		
		


== function ==
the lining of the jejunum is specialized for the absorption by enterocytes of small nutrient particles which have been previously digested by enzymes in the duodenum. once absorbed, nutrients (with the exception of fat, which goes to the lymph) pass from the enterocytes into the enterohepatic circulation and enter the liver via the hepatic portal vein, where the blood is processed.


== other animals ==
in fish, the divisions of the small intestine are not as clear and the terms middle intestine or mid-gut may be used instead of jejunum.


== history ==


=== etymology ===
jejunum is derived from the latin word jējūnus, meaning ""fasting."" it was so called because this part of the small intestine was frequently found to be void of food following death, due to its intensive peristaltic activity relative to the duodenum and ileum.
the early modern english adjective jejune is derived from the same root.

dna replication licensing factor mcm5 (mouse),protein,"cdt1 (chromatin licensing and dna replication factor 1) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the cdt1 gene. it is a licensing factor that functions to limit dna from replicating more than once per cell cycle.


== role in pre-replication complexes ==
the protein encoded by this gene is a key licensing factor in the assembly of pre-replication complexes (pre-rc), which occurs during the g1 phase of the cell cycle. in the assembly of pre-rcs, origin recognition complexes (orc1-6) recognize and bind to dna replication origins. cdt1, along with the protein cdc6, are then recruited to the forming pre-rc, followed by minichromosome maintenance complexes (mcm2-7).the activity of cdt1 during the cell cycle is tightly regulated during the s phase by the protein geminin, which inhibits its, and by scfskp2, which ubiquinates the protein to tag it for proteasomal degradation. this regulation is important in preventing relicensing, thus ensuring that dna is only replicated once per cell cycle.


== orthologs ==
cdt1 belongs to a family of replication proteins conserved from yeast to humans. examples of orthologs in other species include:

s. pombe – cdt1 (cdc10-dependent transcript 1)
drosophila melanogaster – 'double parked' or dup
xenopus laevis - cdt1


== interactions ==
dna replication factor cdt1 has been shown to interact with skp2. cdt1 is recruited by the origin recognition complex in origin licensing. null-mutations for cdt1 are lethal in yeast; the spores undergo mitosis without dna replication. the overexpression of cdt1 causes rereplication in h. sapiens, which activates the chk1 pathway, preventing entry into mitosis.

xylitol chewing gum,drug,"xylitol is a chemical compound with the formula c5h12o5, or ho(ch2)(choh)3(ch2)oh; specifically, one particular stereoisomer with that structural formula. it is a colorless or white crystalline solid that is soluble in water. it can be classified as a polyalcohol  and a sugar alcohol, specifically an alditol. the name derives from ancient greek: ξύλον, xyl[on], ""wood"", with the suffix -itol used to denote sugar alcohols.
xylitol is used as a food additive and sugar substitute.  its european union code number is e967. replacing sugar with xylitol in food products may promote better dental health, but evidence is lacking on whether xylitol itself prevents cavities.


== structure, production, commerce ==
xylitol is naturally occurring in small amounts in plums, strawberries, cauliflower, and pumpkin; humans and animals make trace amounts during metabolism of carbohydrates. unlike most sugar alcohols, xylitol is achiral. most other isomers of pentane-1,2,3,4,5-pentol are chiral, but xylitol has a plane of symmetry.
industrial production starts with lignocellulosic biomass from which xylan is extracted; raw biomass materials include hardwoods, softwoods, and agricultural waste from processing maize, wheat, or rice. the xylan polymers can be hydrolyzed into xylose, which is catalytically hydrogenated into xylitol. the conversion changes the sugar (xylose, an aldehyde) into the primary alcohol, xylitol. impurities are then removed. the processing is often done using standard industrial methods; industrial fermentation involving bacteria, fungi, or yeast, especially candida tropicalis, are common, but are not as efficient.according to the us department of energy, xylitol production by fermentation from discarded biomass is one of the most valuable renewable chemicals for commerce, forecast to be a us$1.4 billion industry by 2025.


== uses ==
xylitol is used as a sugar substitute in such manufactured products as drugs, dietary supplements, confections, toothpaste, and chewing gum, but is not a common household sweetener. xylitol has negligible effects on blood sugar because it is metabolized independently of insulin. absorbed more slowly than sugar, xylitol supplies 40% fewer calories than table sugar. it is approved as a food additive in the united states. xylitol is also found as an additive to saline solution for nasal irrigation and has been found to be effective in improving symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis.


== food properties ==
xylitol has about the same sweetness as sucrose, but more sweetness than similar compounds like sorbitol and mannitol. xylitol is stable enough to be used in baking. because xylitol and other polyols are heat stable, they do not caramelise as sugars do, and they also lower the freezing point of mixtures in which they are used.no serious health risk exists in most humans for normal levels of consumption; the european food safety authority has not set a limit on daily intake of xylitol. due to the adverse laxative effect that all polyols have on the digestive system in high doses, xylitol is banned from soft drinks in the eu. similarly due to a 1985 report, by the eu scientific committee on food, stating that ""ingesting 50 g a day of xylitol can cause diarrhea"", tabletop sweeteners containing xylitol are required to display the warning: ""excessive consumption may induce laxative effects"". chewing gum containing xylitol is permitted.


== health effects ==


=== dental care ===
as of 2015, clinical trials examining whether xylitol alone or with other agents can prevent cavities found the evidence was too poor to allow generalizations, although when children with permanent teeth use fluoride toothpaste with xylitol, they may get fewer cavities than when using fluoride toothpaste without it. weak evidence indicates that chewing gum sweetened with xylitol (or similar polyols such as sorbitol) may reduce the incidence of cavities.in 2008, the european food safety authority (efsa) concluded that ""xylitol chewing gum reduces the risk of cavities in children"". the claim was controversially recognised as requiring rewording in 2009 because xylitol chewing gum is not a medicine, thus can ""not be claimed to reduce the risk of a disease"". in 2011, efsa approved a claim that replacing sugar with xylitol and similar sweeteners ""may maintain tooth mineralisation compared with sugar-containing foods.""


=== ear aches ===
in 2011, efsa ""concluded that there was not enough evidence to support"" the claim that xylitol-sweetened gum could prevent middle-ear infections with a fast onset, which is also known as acute otitis media (aom). a 2016 review indicated that xylitol in chewing gum or a syrup may have a moderate effect in preventing ear aches in healthy children. it may be an alternative to conventional therapies (such as antibiotics) to lower risk of aom in healthy children – reducing risk of occurrence by 25% – although there is no definitive proof that it could be used as a therapy for aom.


=== diabetes ===
in 2011, efsa approved a marketing claim that foods or beverages containing xylitol or similar sugar replacers cause lower blood glucose and lower insulin responses compared to sugar-containing foods or drinks. xylitol products are used as sucrose substitutes for weight control, as xylitol has 40 percent fewer calories than sucrose (2.4 kcal/g compared to 4.0 for sucrose). the glycemic index (gi) of xylitol is 7 if gi is 100 for glucose.


== adverse effects ==


=== humans ===
xylitol has no known toxicity in humans. when ingested at high doses, xylitol and other polyols may cause gastrointestinal discomfort, including flatulence, diarrhea, and irritable bowel syndrome (see metabolism section); some people experiencing these adverse effects at lower doses. xylitol has a lower laxation threshold than some sugar alcohols but is more easily tolerated than mannitol and sorbitol.increased xylitol consumption can increase oxalate, calcium and phosphate excretion to urine. these effects are termed oxaluria, calciuria and phosphaturia, respectively. these are risk factors for kidney stone disease, but xylitol ingestion has not been linked to this disease in humans.


=== dogs and other animals ===
in dogs, 100 mg of xylitol per kg of body weight (mg/kg bw) causes a dose-dependent insulin release that can result in hypoglycemia, which can be life-threatening. hypoglycemia associated symptoms of xylitol toxicity may arise as quickly as 30 to 60 minutes after ingestion. vomiting is a common first symptom. it can be followed by tiredness and ataxia. at doses above 500 mg/kg bw, liver failure is likely and may result in coagulopathies like disseminated intravascular coagulation.xylitol is safe for cats, which tolerate even 1000 mg/kg bw ingested doses of it. it is also safe for rhesus macaques, horses and rats.


== metabolism ==
xylitol has 2.4 kcal/g (10 kj/mol) of food energy according to us and eu food labeling regulations. the real value can vary, depending on metabolic factors. about 50% of eaten xylitol is not absorbed by the intestines in humans. instead, 50–75% of this amount is fermented by gut bacteria to short-chain organic acids and gases, which may cause flatulence. the rest of the unabsorbed xylitol is excreted unchanged mostly in feces and less than 2 g of xylitol out of every 100 g ingested is excreted in urine. xylitol ingestion also increases motilin secretion, which may be related to xylitol's ability to cause diarrhea. the non-digestible but fermentable nature of xylitol also contributes to constipation relieving effects.about 50% of xylitol is absorbed via intestines. primarily, the liver metabolizes it. the main metabolic route in humans is: in cytoplasm, nonspecific nad-dependent dehydrogenase (polyol dehydrogenase) transforms xylitol to d-xylulose. specific xylulokinase phosphorylates it to d-xylulose-5-phosphate. this then goes to pentose phosphate pathway for further processing.


== history ==
sugar rationing during world war ii led to an interest in sugar substitutes. interest in xylitol and other polyols became intense, leading to their characterization and manufacturing methods.

oxygen accumulating cell,cell,"the great oxidation event (goe), sometimes also called the great oxygenation event, oxygen catastrophe, oxygen crisis, oxygen holocaust, or oxygen revolution, was a time period when the earth's atmosphere and the shallow ocean first experienced a rise in oxygen, approximately 2.4–2.0 ga (billion years ago) during the paleoproterozoic era. geological, isotopic, and chemical evidence suggest that biologically produced molecular oxygen (dioxygen, o2) started to accumulate in earth's atmosphere and changed it from a weakly reducing atmosphere to an oxidizing atmosphere, causing many existing species on earth to die out. the cyanobacteria producing the oxygen caused the event which enabled the subsequent development of multicellular forms.


== the early atmosphere ==
the composition of the earth's earliest atmosphere is not known with certainty. however, the bulk of the atmosphere was likely dinitrogen, n2, and carbon dioxide, co2, which are also the predominant carbon- and nitrogen-bearing gases that are produced by volcanism today. these are relatively inert gases. the sun shone at only at about 70% of its current brightness at 4 ga, but there is strong evidence that liquid water existed on earth at the time. a warm earth, in spite of a faint sun, is known as the faint young sun paradox. either carbon dioxide levels were much higher at the time, in order to provide enough of a greenhouse effect to warm the earth, or other greenhouse gases were present. the most likely such gas is methane, ch4, which is a powerful greenhouse gas and was produced by early forms of life known as methanogens. scientists continue to research how the earth was warmed before life arose.an atmosphere of n2 and co2 with trace amounts of h2o, ch4, carbon monoxide (co), and hydrogen (h2), is described as a weakly reducing atmosphere. such an atmosphere contains practically no oxygen. the modern atmosphere contains abudant oxygen, making it an oxidizing atmosphere. the rise in oxygen is attributed to photosynthesis by cyanobacteria, which are thought to have evolved as early as 3.5 ga.the current scientific understanding of when and how the earth's atmosphere changed from a weakly reducing atmosphere to a strongly oxidizing atmosphere largely began with the work of the american geologist, preston cloud, in the 1970s. cloud observed that detrital sediments older than about 2 ga contained grains of pyrite, uraninite, and siderite,, all minerals containing reduced (ferrous) iron that are not found in younger sediments because they are rapidly oxidized in an oxidizing atmosphere. he further observed that continental redbeds, which get their color from the oxidized (ferric) mineral hematite, began to appear in the geological record at about this time. banded iron formation largely disappears from the geological record at 1.85 ga, after peaking at about 2.5 ga. banded iron formation can form only when abundant dissolved ferrous iron is transported into depositional basins, and an oxygenated ocean blocks such transport by oxidizing the iron to form insoluble ferric iron compounds. the end of the deposition of banded iron formation at 1.85 ga is therefore interpreted as marking the oxygenation of the deep ocean. heinrich holland further elaborated these ideas through the 1980s, placing the main time interval of oxygenation between 2.2 and 1.9 ga, and they continue to shape the current scientific understanding.


== geological evidence ==
evidence for the great oxidation event is provided by a variety of petrological and geochemical markers.


=== continental indicators ===
paleosols, detrital grains, and redbeds are evidence of low-level oxygen. paleosols (fossil soils) older than 2.4 ga have low iron concentrations that suggests anoxic weathering. detrital grains found in sediments older than 2.4 ga contain minerals that are stable only under low oxygen conditions. redbeds are red-colored sandstones that are coated with hematite, which indicates that there was enough oxygen to oxidize iron to its ferric state.


=== banded iron formation (bif) ===

banded iron formations are composed of thin alternating layers of chert (a fine-grained form of silica) and the iron oxides, magnetite and hematite. extensive deposits of this rock type are found around the world, almost all of which are older than 1.85 ga and most of which were deposited around 2.5 ga. the iron in banded iron formation is partially oxidized, with roughly equal amounts of ferrous and ferric iron. deposition of banded iron formation requires both an anoxic deep ocean capable of transporting iron in soluble ferrous form, and an oxidized shallow ocean where the ferrous iron is oxidized to insoluble ferric iron and precipitates onto the ocean floor. the deposition of banded iron formation before 1.8 ga suggests the ocean was in a persistent ferruginous state, but deposition was episodic and there may have been significant intervals of euxenia.


=== iron speciation ===
black laminated shales, rich in organic matter, are often regarded as a marker for anoxic conditions. however, the deposition of abundant organic matter is not a sure indication of anoxia, and burrowing organisms that destroy lamination had not yet evolved during the time frame of the great oxygenation event. thus laminated black shale by itself is a poor indicator of oxygen levels. scientists must look instead for geochemical evidence of anoxic conditions. these include ferruginous anoxia, in which dissolved ferrous iron is abundant, and euxinia, in which hydrogen sulfide is present in the water.examples of such indicators of anoxic conditions include the degree of pyritization (dop), which is the ratio of iron present as pyrite to the total reactive iron. reactive iron, in turn, is defined as iron found in oxides and oxyhydroxides, carbonates, and reduced sulfur minerals such as pyrites, in contrast with iron tightly bound in silicate minerals. a dop near zero indicates oxidizing conditions, while a dop near 1 indicates euxenic conditions. values of 0.3 to 0.5 are transitional, suggesting anoxic bottom mud under an oxygenated ocean. studies of the black sea, which is considered a modern model for ancient anoxic ocean basins, indicate that high dop, a high ratio of reactive iron to total iron, and a high ratio of total iron to aluminum are all indicators of transport of iron into a euxinic environment. ferruginous anoxic conditions can be distinguished from euxenic conditions by a dop less than about 0.7.the currently available evidence suggests that the deep ocean remained anoxic and ferruginous as late as 0.58 ga, well after the great oxygenation event, remaining just short of euxenic during much of this interval of time. deposition of banded iron formation ceased when conditions of local euxenia on continental platforms and shelves began precipitating iron out of upwelling ferruginous water as pyrite.

some of the most persuasive evidence for the great oxidation event is provided by the mass-independent fractionation (mif) of sulfur. the chemical signature of the mif of sulfur is found prior to 2.4–2.3 ga but disappears thereafter. the presence of this signature all but eliminates the possibility of an oxygenated atmosphere.different isotopes of a chemical element have slightly different atomic masses. most of the differences in geochemistry between isotopes of the same element scale with this mass difference. these include small differences in molecular velocities and diffusion rates, which are described as mass-dependent fractionation processes. by contrast, mass-independent fractionation describes processes that are not proportional to the difference in mass between isotopes. the only such process likely to be significant in the geochemistry of sulfur is photodissociation. this is the process in which a molecule containing sulfur is broken up by solar ultraviolet (uv) radiation. the presence of a clear mif signature for sulfur prior to 2.4 ga shows that uv radiation was penetrating deep into the earth's atmosphere. this in turn rules out an atmosphere containing more than traces of oxygen, which would have produced an ozone layer that shielded the lower atmosphere from uv radiation. the disappearance of the mif signature for sulfur indicates the formation of such an ozone shield as oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere.mass-dependent fractionation also provides clues to the great oxygenation event. for example, oxidation of manganese in surface rocks by atmospheric oxygen leads to further reactions that oxidize chromium. the heavier 53cr is oxidized preferentially over the lighter 52cr, and the soluble oxidized chromium carried into the ocean shows this enhancement of the heavier isotope. the chromium isotope ratio in banded iron formation suggests small but significant quantities of oxygen in the atmosphere before the great oxidation event, and a brief return to low oxygen abundance 500 million years after the great oxidation event. however, the chromium data may conflict with the sulfur isotope data, which calls the reliability of the chromium data into question. it is also possible that oxygen was present earlier only in localized ""oxygen oases"". since chromium is not easily dissolved, its release from rocks requires the presence of a powerful acid such as sulfuric acid (h2so4) which may have formed through bacterial oxidation of pyrite. this could provide some of the earliest evidence of oxygen-breathing life on land surfaces.other elements whose mass-dependent fractionation may provide clues to the great oxidation event include carbon, nitrogen, transitional metals such as molybdenum and iron, and non-metal elements such as selenium.


=== fossils and biomarkers ===

structures interpreted as fossils of cyanobacteria exist in rock as old as 3.5 ga. these include microfossils of individual cyanobacteria cells, which are best preserved in chert. such fossils show forms very similar to modern cyanobacteria. macrofossils include stromatolites, which are interpreted as large colonies of cyanobacteria that formed characteristic layered structures. these strongly resemble living stromatolites found in harsh modern environments, such as shark bay in western australia. some of these fossils contain biomarkers, also known as molecular fossils, interpreted as breakdown products of photosynthetic pigments. for example, traces of 2α-methylhopanes thought to be from cyanobacteria were found in pilbara, western australia. however, the biomarker data has since been shown to have been contaminated and so results are no longer accepted.the presence of fossils resembling cyanobacteria in form is not in itself conclusive proof of early oxygen photosynthesis. there is evidence that the earliest ancestors of cyanobacteria were not photosynthetic, and acquired the ability to carry out oxygen photosynthesis only later, from horizontal gene transfer. thus biomarkers for molecules associated with photosynthetic metabolism are eagerly sought. one such family of molecules are the steranes, which are thought to require oxygen for their synthesis. mid‐chain branched monomethylalkanes are also a promising candidate for such biomarkers.


=== other indicators ===
some elements in marine sediments are sensitive to different levels of oxygen in the environment such as transition metals molybdenum and rhenium. non-metal elements such as selenium and iodine are also indicators of oxygen levels.


== hypotheses ==

the ability to generate oxygen via photosynthesis likely first appeared in the ancestors of cyanobacteria. these organisms evolved at least 2.45–2.32 ga, and probably as early as 2.7 ga or earlier. however, oxygen remained scarce in the atmosphere until around 2.0 ga, and banded iron formation continued to be deposited until around 1.85 ga. given the rapid multiplication rate of cyanobacteria under ideal conditions, an explanation is needed for the delay of at least 400 million years between the evolution of oxygen-producing photosynthesis and the appearance of significant oxygen in the atmosphere.hypotheses to explain this gap must take into consideration the balance between oxygen sources and oxygen sinks. oxygenic photosynthesis produces organic carbon that must be segregated from oxygen to allow oxygen accumulation in the surface environment, otherwise the oxygen back-reacts with the organic carbon and does not accumulate. the burial of organic carbon, sulfide, and minerals containing ferrous iron (fe2+) is a primary factor in oxygen accumulation. when organic carbon is buried without being oxidized, the oxygen is left in the atmosphere. in total, the burial of organic carbon and pyrite today creates 15.8±3.3 tmol (1 tmol = 1012 moles) of o2 per year. this creates a net o2 flux from the global oxygen sources.
the rate of change of oxygen can be calculated from the difference between global sources and sinks. the oxygen sinks include reduced gases and minerals from volcanoes, metamorphism and weathering. the goe started after these oxygen-sink fluxes and reduced-gas fluxes were exceeded by the flux of o2 associated with the burial of reductants, such as organic carbon. for the weathering mechanisms, 12.0±3.3 tmol of o2 per year today goes to the sinks composed of reduced minerals and gases from volcanoes, metamorphism, percolating seawater and heat vents from the seafloor. on the other hand, 5.7±1.2 tmol of o2 per year today oxidizes reduced gases in the atmosphere through photochemical reaction. on the early earth, there was visibly very little oxidative weathering of continents (e.g., a lack of  redbeds) and so the weathering sink on oxygen would have been negligible compared to that from reduced gases and dissolved iron in oceans.
dissolved iron in oceans exemplifies o2 sinks. free oxygen produced during this time was chemically captured by dissolved iron, converting iron fe and fe2+ to magnetite (fe2+fe3+2o4) that is insoluble in water, and sank to the bottom of the shallow seas to create banded iron formations such as the ones found in minnesota and pilbara, western australia. it took 50 million years or longer to deplete the oxygen sinks. the rate of photosynthesis and associated rate of organic burial also affect the rate of oxygen accumulation. when land plants spread over the continents in the devonian, more organic carbon was buried and likely allowed higher o2 levels to occur. today, the average time that an o2 molecule spends in the air before it is consumed by geological sinks is about 2 million years. that residence time is relatively short in geologic time - so in the phanerozoic there must have been feedback processes that kept the atmospheric o2 level within bounds suitable for animal life.


=== evolution by stages ===
preston cloud originally proposed that the first cyanobacteria had evolved the capacity to carry out oxygen-producing photosynthesis, but had not yet evolved enzymes (such as superoxide dismutase) for living in an oxygenated environment. these cyanobacteria would have been protected from their own poisonous oxygen waste through its rapid removal via the high levels of reduced ferrous iron, fe(ii), in the early ocean. cloud suggested that the oxygen released by photosynthesis oxidized the fe(ii) to ferric iron, fe(iii), which precipitated out of the sea water to form banded iron formation. cloud interpreted the great peak in deposition of banded iron formation at the end of the archean as the signature for the evolution of mechanisms for living with oxygen. this ended self-poisoning and produced a population explosion in the cyanobacteria that rapidly oxygenated the ocean and ended banded iron formation deposition. however, improved dating of precambrian strata showed that the late archean peak of deposition was spread out over tens of millions of years, rather than taking place in a very short interval of time following the evolution of oxygen-coping mechanisms. this made cloud's hypothesis untenable.more recently, families of bacteria have been discovered that show no indication of ever having had photosynthetic capability, but which otherwise closely resemble cyanobacteria. these may be descended from the earliest ancestors of cyanobacteria, which only later acquired photosynthetic ability by lateral gene transfer. based on molecular clock data, the evolution of oxygen-producing photosynthesis may have occurred much later than previously thought, at around 2.5 ga. this reduces the gap between the evolution of oxygen photosynthesis and the appearance of significant atmospheric oxygen.


=== nutrient famines ===
a second possibility is that early cyanobacteria were starved for vital nutrients and this checked their growth. however, a lack of the scarcest nutrients, iron, nitrogen, and phosphorus, could have slowed, but not prevented, a cyanobacteria population explosion and rapid oxygenation. the explanation for the delay in the oxygenation of the atmosphere following the evolution of oxygen-producing photosynthesis likely lies in the presence of various oxygen sinks in the young earth.


==== nickel famine ====
early chemosynthetic organisms likely produced methane, an important trap for molecular oxygen, since methane readily oxidizes to carbon dioxide (co2) and water in the presence of uv radiation. modern methanogens require nickel as an enzyme cofactor. as the earth's crust cooled and the supply of volcanic nickel dwindled, oxygen-producing algae began to out-perform methane producers, and the oxygen percentage of the atmosphere steadily increased. from 2.7 to 2.4 billion years ago, the rate of deposition of nickel declined steadily from a level 400 times today's.


=== increasing flux ===
some people suggest that goe is caused by the increase of the source of oxygen. one hypothesis argues that goe was the immediate result of photosynthesis, although the majority of scientists suggest that a long-term increase of oxygen is more likely the case. several model results show possibilities of long-term increase of carbon burial, but the conclusions are indecisive.


=== decreasing sink ===
in contrast to the increasing flux hypothesis, there are also several hypotheses that attempt to use decrease of sinks to explain goe. one theory suggests that composition of the volatiles from volcanic gases was more oxidized. another theory suggests that the decrease of metamorphic gases and serpentinization is the main key of goe. hydrogen and methane released from metamorphic processes are also lost from earth's atmosphere over time and leave the crust oxidized. scientists realized that hydrogen would escape into space through a process called methane photolysis, in which methane decomposes under the action of ultraviolet light in the upper atmosphere and releases its hydrogen. the escape of hydrogen from the earth into space must have oxidized the earth because the process of hydrogen loss is chemical oxidation. this process of hydrogen escape required the generation of methane by methanogens, so that methanogens actually helped create the conditions necessary for the oxidation of the atmosphere.


=== tectonic trigger ===

one hypothesis suggests that the oxygen increase had to await tectonically driven changes in the earth, including the appearance of shelf seas, where reduced organic carbon could reach the sediments and be buried. the newly produced oxygen was first consumed in various chemical reactions in the oceans, primarily with iron. evidence is found in older rocks that contain massive banded iron formations apparently laid down as this iron and oxygen first combined; most present-day iron ore lies in these deposits. it was assumed oxygen released from cyanobacteria resulted in the chemical reactions that created rust, but it appears the iron formations were caused by anoxygenic phototrophic iron-oxidizing bacteria, which does not require oxygen. evidence suggests oxygen levels spiked each time smaller land masses collided to form a super-continent. tectonic pressure thrust up mountain chains, which eroded to release nutrients into the ocean to feed photosynthetic cyanobacteria.


=== bistability ===
another hypothesis posits a model of the atmosphere that exhibits bistability: two steady states of oxygen concentration. the state of stable low oxygen concentration (0.02%) experiences a high rate of methane oxidation. if some event raises oxygen levels beyond a moderate threshold, the formation of an ozone layer shields uv rays and decreases methane oxidation, raising oxygen further to a stable state of 21% or more. the great oxygenation event can then be understood as a transition from the lower to the upper steady states.


== consequences of oxygenation ==
eventually, oxygen started to accumulate in the atmosphere, with two major consequences.

oxygen likely oxidized atmospheric methane (a strong greenhouse gas) to carbon dioxide (a weaker one) and water. this weakened the greenhouse effect of the earth's atmosphere, causing planetary cooling, which has been proposed to have triggered a series of ice ages known as the huronian glaciation, bracketing an age range of 2.45–2.22 ga. a fourth glaciation event found in south africa is ~2.22 ga in age. because geological evidence suggests that the ice reached sea-level in some areas and that the south african event occurred at low latitudes, the latter is associated with a so-called snowball earth.
the increased oxygen concentrations provided a new opportunity for  biological diversification, as well as tremendous changes in the nature of chemical interactions between rocks, sand, clay, and other geological substrates and the earth's air, oceans, and other surface waters. despite the natural recycling of organic matter, life had remained energetically limited until the widespread availability of oxygen. this breakthrough in metabolic evolution greatly increased the free energy available to living organisms, with global environmental impacts. for example, mitochondria evolved after the goe, giving organisms the energy to exploit new, more complex morphology interacting in increasingly complex ecosystems, although these did not appear until the late proterozoic and cambrian.


=== role in mineral diversification ===

the great oxygenation event triggered an explosive growth in the diversity of minerals, with many elements occurring in one or more oxidized forms near the earth's surface. it is estimated that the goe was directly responsible for more than 2,500 of the total of about 4,500 minerals found on earth today. most of these new minerals were formed as hydrated and oxidized forms due to dynamic mantle and crust processes.


=== role in cyanobacteria evolution ===
in field studies done in lake fryxell, antarctica, scientists found that mats of oxygen-producing cyanobacteria produced a thin layer, one to two millimeters thick, of oxygenated water in an otherwise anoxic environment, even under thick ice. by inference, these organisms could have adapted to oxygen even before oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere. eventually, the evolution of oxygen-dependent organisms, such as cyanobacteria, established an equilibrium in the availability of oxygen, which became a major constituent of the atmosphere.


=== origin of eukaryotes ===
it has been proposed that a local rise in oxygen levels due to cyanobacterial photosynthesis in ancient microenvironments was highly toxic to the surrounding biota, and that this selective pressure drove the evolutionary transformation of an archaeal lineage into the first eukaryotes.  oxidative stress involving production of reactive oxygen species (ros) might have acted in synergy with other environmental stresses (such as ultraviolet radiation and/or desiccation) to drive selection in an early archaeal lineage towards eukaryosis.  this archaeal ancestor may already have had dna repair mechanisms based on dna pairing and recombination and possibly some kind of cell fusion mechanism. the detrimental effects of internal ros (produced by endosymbiont proto-mitochondria) on the archaeal genome could have promoted the evolution of meiotic sex from these humble beginnings. selective pressure for efficient dna repair of oxidative dna damages may have driven the evolution of eukaryotic sex involving such features as cell-cell fusions, cytoskeleton-mediated chromosome movements and emergence of the nuclear membrane. thus the evolution of eukaryotic sex and eukaryogenesis were likely inseparable processes that evolved in large part to facilitate dna repair.

arrhinoceratops,non_science,"arrhinoceratops (meaning ""no nose-horn face"", derived from the ancient greek ""a-/α-"" ""no"", rhis/ῥίς ""nose"" ""keras/κέρας"" ""horn"", ""-ops/ὤψ"" ""face"") is a genus of herbivorous ceratopsian dinosaur. the name was coined as its original describer concluded it was special because the nose-horn was not a separate bone, however further analysis revealed this was based on a misunderstanding. it lived during the latest campanian/earliest maastrichtian stage of the late cretaceous, predating its famous relative triceratops by a few million years, although it was contemporary with anchiceratops. its remains have been found in canada.


== discoveries and species ==
described by william arthur parks in 1925, arrhinoceratops is known from a partially crushed, slightly distorted skull which lacked the lower jaws. the remains were collected from the neill's ranch site, along the red deer river in alberta by a 1923 expedition from the university of toronto.parks named the type species arrhinoceratops brachyops. the generic name is derived from greek α~, ""without"", ῥίς, rhis, ""nose"", κέρας, keras, ""horn"", and ὤψ, ops, ""face"" as parks had established that no separate nose-horn was present. the specific name means ""short-faced"" from greek βραχύς, brachys, ""short"".the holotype is rom 796 (earlier rom 5135), which was found in a layer of the horseshoe canyon formation dating from the latest campanian or perhaps earliest maastrichtian. it consists of the original skull.
other material from utah, found in the 1930s, was posthumously named arrhinoceratops? utahensis by charles whitney gilmore in 1946. it is based on holotype usnm 15583. the question mark indicates that gilmore himself had doubts about the identification. in 1976, douglas a. lawson transferred the species to torosaurus, as a torosaurus utahensis.apart from the holotype skull little fossil material of arrhinoceratops brachyops has been found. in 1981 helen tyson in a revision of the genus, provisionally referred specimen rom 1439, but in 2007 andrew farke moved this to torosaurus.


== description ==
 
since this dinosaur is known only from its skull, scientists have few data about its overall anatomy. the skull, as restored, features a broad, square, neck frill with two oval shaped openings. the frill is deeply veined on both the top and the underside by arterial grooves. the sides of the frill are adorned by about nine osteoderms. the rear edge of the frill is lightly scalloped. the left squamosal in the frill side of the holotype shows a pathological opening, perhaps the result of a wound. its brow horns were moderately long, but its nose horn was shorter and blunter than most ceratopids. the snout is short and high. its body is assumed to be typical of the ceratopsidae. based on the skull some popular-science books estimate the body length to be 6 m (20 ft) long when fully grown. in 2010, gregory s. paul estimated its length at 4.5 metres (15 ft), its weight at 1.3 tonnes (2,900 lb).already richard swann lull had in 1933 been politely critical of parks' original description, and tyson discovered that parks, an entomologist, had made many mistakes. the most notable of these was that the very trait the genus was named after, the lack of a separate ossification or os epinasale for the nose-horn, is in fact normal for the ceratopids, in which group this horn is an outgrowth of the nasal bone, not a distinct element. other incorrect observations by parks included the conclusion that the os rostrale, the bone core of the upper beak, directly touched the nasals instead of being separated from them by the premaxillae; a presumed anterior process of the jugal touching the premaxilla; and thinking that the interparietal bar of the frill presented a separate skeletal element, an os interparietale.


== phylogeny ==
arrhinoceratops was by parks placed within the ceratopsia (this name is ancient greek for ""horned faces""), a group of herbivorous dinosaurs with parrot-like beaks which thrived in north america and asia during the cretaceous period, which ended roughly 66 million years ago. in 1930 lori russell refined this to the ceratopsidae. tyson concluded it was closely related to torosaurus, probably even its direct ancestor.modern research indicates that arrhinoceratops is a member of the chasmosaurinae. cladistic analyses recover it close to anchiceratops.

the following cladogram shows the phylogeny of arrhinoceratops according to a study by scott sampson e.a. in 2010.


== paleobiology ==
arrhinoceratops lived in a wet coast-land with warm summers but cool winters. it was likely preyed upon by albertosaurus.arrhinoceratops, like all ceratopsians, was a herbivore. during the cretaceous, flowering plants were ""geographically limited on the landscape"", and so it is likely that this dinosaur fed on the predominant plants of the era: ferns, cycads and conifers. it would have used its sharp ceratopsian beak to bite off the leaves or needles. its habitat was densely forested.

immature eosinophil,cell,"eosinophilia is a condition in which the eosinophil count in the peripheral blood exceeds 0.5×109/l (500/μl). hypereosinophilia is an elevation in an individual's circulating blood eosinophil count above 1.5 x 109/l  (i.e. 1,500/μl). the hypereosinophilic syndrome is a sustained elevation in this count above 1.5 x 109/l (i.e. 1,500/μl) that is also associated with evidence of eosinophil-based tissue injury.
eosinophils usually account for less than 7% of the circulating leukocytes. a marked increase in non-blood tissue eosinophil count noticed upon histopathologic examination is diagnostic for tissue eosinophilia. several causes are known, with the most common being some form of allergic reaction or parasitic infection. diagnosis of eosinophilia is via a complete blood count (cbc), but diagnostic procedures directed at the underlying cause vary depending on the suspected condition(s). an absolute eosinophil count is not generally needed if the cbc shows marked eosinophilia. the location of the causal factor can be used to classify eosinophilia into two general types: extrinsic, in which the factor lies outside the eosinophil cell lineage; and intrinsic eosinophilia, which denotes etiologies within the eosiniphil cell line.  specific treatments are dictated by the causative condition, though in idiopathic eosinophilia, the disease may be controlled with corticosteroids. eosinophilia is not a disorder (rather, only a sign) unless it is idiopathic.informally, blood eosinophil levels are often regarded as mildly elevated at counts of 500–1,500/μl, moderately elevated between 1,500–5,000/μl, and severely elevated when greater than 5,000/μl. elevations in blood eosinophil counts can be transient, sustained, recurrent, or cyclical.eosinophil counts in human blood normally range between 100–500 per/μl. maintenance of these levels results from a balance between production of eosinophils by bone marrow eosinophil precursor cells termed cfu-eos and the emigration of circulating eosinophils out of the blood through post-capillary venules into tissues. eosinophils represent a small percentage of peripheral blood leucocytes (usually less than 8%), have a half-life in the circulation of only 8–18 hours, but persist in tissues for at least several weeks.eosinophils are one form of terminally differentiated granulocytes; they function to neutralize invading microbes, primarily parasites and helminthes but also certain types of fungi and viruses. they also participate in transplant rejection, graft-versus-host disease, and the killing of tumor cells. in conducting these functions, eosinophils produce and release on demand a range of toxic reactive oxygen species (e.g. hypobromite, hypobromous acid, superoxide, and peroxide) and they also release on demand a preformed armamentarium of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, lipid mediators (e.g. leukotrienes, prostaglandins, platelet activating factor), and toxic proteins (e.g. metalloproteinases, major basic protein, eosinophil cationic protein, eosinophil peroxidase, and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin). these agents serve to orchestrate robust immune and inflammatory responses that destroy invading microbes, foreign tissue, and malignant cells. when overproduced and over-activated, which occurs in certain cases of hypereosinophilia and to a lesser extent eosinophilia, eosinophils may misdirect their reactive oxygen species and armamentarium of preformed molecules toward normal tissues. this can result in serious damage to such organs as the lung, heart, kidneys, and brain.


== pathophysiology ==
ige-mediated eosinophil production is induced by compounds released by basophils and mast cells, including eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis, leukotriene b4 and serotonin mediated release of eosinophil granules occur, complement complex (c5-c6-c7), interleukin 5, and histamine (though this has a narrow range of concentration).harm resulting from untreated eosinophilia potentially varies with cause. during an allergic reaction, the release of histamine from mast cells causes vasodilation which allows eosinophils to migrate from the blood and localize in affected tissues. accumulation of eosinophils in tissues can be significantly damaging. eosinophils, like other granulocytes, contain granules (or sacs) filled with digestive enzymes and cytotoxic proteins which under normal conditions are used to destroy parasites but in eosinophilia these agents can damage healthy tissues. in addition to these agents, the granules in eosinophils also contain inflammatory molecules and cytokines which can recruit more eosinophils and other inflammatory cells to the area and hence amplify and perpetuate the damage. this process is generally accepted to be the major inflammatory process in the pathophysiology of atopic or allergic asthma.


== diagnosis ==
diagnosis is by complete blood count (cbc). however, in some cases, a more accurate absolute eosinophil count may be needed. medical history is taken, with emphasis on travel, allergies and drug use. specific test for causative conditions are performed, often including chest x-ray, urinalysis, liver and kidney function tests, and serologic tests for parasitic and connective tissue diseases. the stool is often examined for traces of parasites (i.e. eggs, larvae, etc.) though a negative test does not rule out parasitic infection; for example, trichinosis requires a muscle biopsy. elevated serum b12 or low white blood cell alkaline phosphatase, or leukocytic abnormalities in a peripheral smear indicates a disorder of myeloproliferation. in cases of idiopathic eosinophilia, the patient is followed for complications. a brief trial of corticosteroids can be diagnostic for allergic causes, as the eosinophilia should resolve with suppression of the immune over-response. neoplastic disorders are diagnosed through the usual methods, such as bone marrow aspiration and biopsy for the leukemias, mri/ct to look for solid tumors, and tests for serum ldh and other tumor markers.


== classification ==
based on their causes, hypereosinophilias can be sorted into subtypes. however, cases of eosinophilia, which exhibit eosinophil counts between 500 and 1,500/μl, may fit the clinical criteria for, and thus be regarded as falling into, one of these hypereosinophilia categories: the cutoff of 1,500/μl between hypereosinophilia and eosinophilia is somewhat arbitrary. there are at least two different guidelines for classifying hypereosinophilia/eosinophilia into subtypes. the general haematoloy and haemato-oncology task forces for the british committee for standards in haematology classifies these disorders into a) primary, i.e. caused by abnormalities in the eosinophil cell line; b) secondary, i.e. caused by non-eosinophil disorders; and c) idiopathic, cause unknown. the world health organization classifies these disorders into a)  myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and abnormalities of pdgfra, pdgfrb, or fgfr1 (i.e. high eosinophil blood counts caused by mutations in the eosinophil cell line of one of these three genes), 'b) chronic eosinophilic leukemia, and c) the idiopathic hypereosinophiic syndrome. in the latter classification, secondary hypereosinophilia/eosinophilia is not viewed as a true disorder of eosinophils. here these two classifications are merged and expanded to include the many forms of secondary, i.e. reactive hypereosinophilia/eosinophilia, disorders and also includes another subtype, organ-restricted hypereosinophilias, a disorder in which eosinophil-mediated tissue damage is restricted to one organ and is often but not always associated with increased blood eosinophil counts.


=== primary hypereosinophilia ===
primary hypereosinophilia is due to the development of a clone of eosinophils, i.e. a group of genetically identical eosinophils derived from a significantly mutated ancestor cell. the clone may prove to be benign, pre-malignant, or overtly malignant. the fundamental driver of these hypereosinophilic (or uncommonly eosinophilic) disorders is the mutation which increases the proliferation, survival, and further mutation of cells descendant from the originally mutated cell. there are several subtypes of primary hypereosinophilia.


==== clonal hypereosinophilia ====

clonal hypereosinophilia is hypereosinophilia caused by a pre-malignant or malignant clone of eosinophils that bear mutations in genes for pdgfra, pdgfrb, or fgfr1 or, alternatively, a chromosome translocation that creates the pcm1-jak2 fusion gene. these genes code for dysfunctional protein products capable of enhancing proliferation and/or survival of their parent cells which, in consequence, become an evolving and constantly growing clone of eosinophils.  these mutations are recognized by the world health association as causing distinct entities differing from idiopathic hypereosinophilia and the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. presence of these clones may be associated with tissue injury but in any case suggests specific therapy be directed at reducing the size and suppressing the growth of the eosinophil clone. more recently, mutations in other genes have been described as causing a similar type of clonal hypereosinophilia but have not yet been recognized as entities distinct from idiopathic hypereosinophilia and the idiopathic hyperesoniphilic syndrome. these include gene mutations in jak2, abl1, and flt2 and chromosomal translocations that create the etv6-acsl6 fusion gene.


==== chronic eosinophilic leukemia (nos) ====

chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified (i.e. cel, nos), is a leukemia-inducing disorder in the eosinophil cell lineage that causes eosinophil blood counts greater than 1,500/μl. the most recent (2017) world health organization criteria specifically excludes from this disorder hypereosinophilia/eosinophilia associated with bcr-abl1 fusion gene-positive chronic myeloid leukemia, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocytosis, primary myelofibrosis, chronic neutrophilic leukemia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia, clonal eosinophilias involving gene rearrangements of pdgfra, pdgfrb, or fgfr1, and chromosome translocations that form pcm1-jak2, etv6-jak2, or bcr-jak2 fusion genes. for this diagnosis, immature eosinophil (e.g. myeloblast) cell counts in the bone marrow and peripheral blood must be less than 20% and the chromosomal alterations (inv(16)(p13.1q22)) and t(16;16)(p13;q22) as well as other features diagnostic of acute myelogenous leukemia must be absent. the latter diagnostic features include clonal cytogenetic abnormalities and molecular genetic abnormalities diagnostic for other forms of leukemia or the presence of myeloblast counts greater than 55% in bone marrow or 2% in blood. chronic eosinophilic leukemia may transform into acute eosinophilic or other types of acute myelogenous leukemia.


==== familial eosinophilia ====

familial eosinophilia is a rare congenital disorder characterized by the presence of sustained elevations in blood eosinophil levels that reach ranges diagnostic of eosinophilia or, far more commonly, hypereosinophilia. it is an autosomal dominant disorder in which genetic linkage gene mapping family studies localize the gene responsible for it to chromosome 5 at position q31-q33, between markers d5s642 and d5s816. this region contains a cytokine gene cluster which includes three genes whose protein products function in regulating the development and proliferation of eosinophils viz., interleukin 3, interleukin 5, and colony stimulating factor 2. however, no functional sequence genetic polylmophisms are found within the promoter, exons, or introns, of these genes or within the common gene enhancer for interleukin 3 or colony stimulating factor 2. this suggests that the primary defect in familial eosinophilia is not a mutation in one of these genes but rather in another gene within this chromosome area. clinical manifestations and tissue destruction related to the eosinophilia in this disorder are uncommon: familial eosinophilia typically has a benign phenotype compared to other congenital and acquired eosinophilic diseases.


==== idiopathic hypereosinophilia ====
idiopathic hypereosinophilia (also termed hypereosinophilia of undetermined significance, i.e. heus) is a disorder characterized by an increase in eosinophil blood counts above 1,500/μl, as detected on at least 2 separate examinations. the disorder cannot be associated with eosinophil-based tissue damage or a primary or secondary cause of eosinophilia. that is, it is a diagnosis of exclusion and has no known cause. over time, this disorder can resolve into a primary hypereosinphilia, typically clonal hyperesinophilia, chronic eosinphilic leukemia, or an eosinophilia associated with another hematological leukemia. the disorder may also become associated with tissue or organ damage and therefore be diagnosed as the hypereosinophilic syndrome. idiopathic hyereosinophilia is treated by observation to detect development of the cited more serious disorders.


==== idiopathic hypereosiophilic syndrome ====

the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome is a disorder characterized by hypereosiophilia that is associated with eosinophil-based tissue or organ damage. while almost any organ or tissue may be damaged, the lung, skin, heart, blood vessels, sinuses, kidneys, and brain are the most commonly afflicted. the world health organization restrict this diagnosis to cases which have no well-defined cause. that is, all cases of secondary (i.e. reactive) eosinophilia (including lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia) and primary hypereosinophilia (including chronic eosinophilic leukemia (nos), clonal eosinophilia, and hypereosinophilia associated with hematological malignancies) are excluded from this diagnosis.


=== secondary hypereosinophilia ===
secondary (or reactive) eosinophilias are non-clonal increases in blood eosinophil levels caused by an underlying disease. the pathogenesis of the hypereosinophilia in these diseases is thought to be the release of one or more cytokines (e.g. granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, interleukin 3, interleukin 5) that: a) cause bone marrow precursor cells, i.e. cfu-eos, to proliferate and mature into eosinophils; b) promote release of bone marrow eosinophils into the circulation, c) stimulate circulating eosinophils to enter tissues and release tissue-injuring agents. these cytokines may be released by the diseased cells or the diseased cells may cause the release of these cytokines by non-diseased cells. primary disorders associated with and known or presumed to cause hypereosinophilia or eosinophilia are given below.


==== infections ====
helminths are common causes of hypereosiophilia and eosinophilia in areas endemic to these parasites. helminths infections causing increased blood eosinophil counts include: 1) nematodes, (i.e. angiostrongylus cantonensis and hookworm infections), ascariasis, strongyloidiasis trichinosis, visceral larva migrans, gnathostomiasis, cysticercosis, and echinococcosis; 2) filarioidea, i.e. tropical pulmonary eosinophilia, loiasis, and onchocerciasis; and 3) flukes, i.e. schistosomiasis, fascioliasis, clonorchiasis, paragonimiasis, and fasciolopsiasis. other infections associated with increased eosinophil blood counts include: protozoan infections, i.e. isospora belli and dientamoeba fragilis) and sarcocystis); fungal infections (i.e. disseminated histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis [especially in cases with central nervous system involvement]), and coccidioides); and viral infections, i.e. human t-lymphotropic virus 1 and hiv.


==== autoimmune diseases ====
hypereosiophilia or eosinophilia may be associated with the following autoimmune diseases: systemic lupus erythematosus eosinophilic fasciitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, dermatomyositis, severe rheumatoid arthritis, progressive systemic sclerosis, sjögren syndrome, thromboangiitis obliterans, behçet's disease, igg4-related disease, inflammatory bowel diseases, sarcoidosis, bullous pemphigoid, and dermatitis herpetiformis.


==== allergic diseases ====
eosinophilia and comparatively fewer cases of hypereosinophilia are associated with the following known diseases that are known or thought to have an allergic basis: allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, chronic sinusitis, aspirin-induced asthma, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, and kimura's disease.certain types of food allergy disorders may also be associated with eosinophilia or, less commonly, hypereosinophilia. allergic eosinophilic esophagitis and the food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome are commonly associated with increased blood eosinophil levels.


==== drugs ====
a wide range of drugs are known to cause hypereosinophilia or eosinophilia accompanied by an array of allergic symptoms. rarely, these reactions are severe causing, for example, the drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (dress) syndrome. while virtually any drug should be considered as a possible cause of these signs and symptoms, the following drugs and drug classes are some of the most frequently reported causes: penicillins, cephalosporins, dapsone, sulfonamides, carbamazepine, phenytoin, lamotrigine, valproic acid, nevirapine, efavirenz, and ibuprofen. these drugs may cause severely toxic reactions such as the dress syndrome. other drugs and drug classes often reported to cause increased blood eosinophil levels accompanied by less severe (e.g. non-dress syndrome) symptoms include tetracyclins, doxycycline, linezolid, nitrofurantoin, metronidazole, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, lamotrigine, valproate, desipramine, amitriptyline, fluoxetine, piroxicam, diclofenac, ace inhibitors, abacavir, nevirapine, ranitidine, cyclosporin, and hydrochlorothiazide.the toxic oil syndrome is associated with hypereosinophilia/eosinophilia and systemic symptoms due to one or more contaminants in rapeseed oil and the eosinophilia–myalgia syndrome, also associated with hypereosinophilia, appears due to trace contaminants in certain commercial batches of the amino acid, l-tryptophan.allergic reactions to drugs are a common cause of eosinophilia, with manifestations ranging from diffuse maculopapular rash, to severe life-threatening drug reactions with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (dress). drugs that has, allopurinol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), some antipsychotics such as risperidone, and certain antibiotics. phenibut, an analogue of the neurotransmitter gaba, has also been implicated in high doses. the reaction which has been shown to be t-cell mediated may also cause eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome.


==== malignancies ====
certain malignancies cause a secondary eosinophilia or, less commonly, hypereosinophilia. these increases in blood eosinophils appear due to the release of stimulatory cytokines or invasion of the bone marrow and thereby irritation of resident eosinophils or their precursors. malignancies associated with these effects include gastric, colorectal, lung, bladder, and thyroid cancers, as well as squamous cell cancers of the cervix, vagina, penis, skin, and nasopharyrnx. some hematological malignancies are likewise associated with secondary rises in blood eosinophil counts; these include hodgkin disease, certain t-cell lymphomas, acute myeloid leukemia, the myelodysplastic syndromes, many cases of systemic mastocytosis, chronic myeloid leukemia, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, myelofibrosis, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and certain cases of t-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma-associated or myelodysplastic–myeloproliferative syndrome-associated eosinophilias.hodgkin lymphoma (hodgkin's disease) often elicits severe eosinophilia; however, non-hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia produce less marked eosinophilia. of solid tumor neoplasms, ovarian cancer is most likely to provoke eosinophilia, though any other cancer can cause the condition. solid epithelial cell tumors have been shown to cause both tissue and blood eosinophilia, with some reports indicating that this may be mediated by interleukin production by tumor cells, especially il-5 or il-3. this has also been shown to occur in hodgkin lymphoma, in the form of il-5 secreted by reed-sternberg cells. in primary cutaneous t cell lymphoma, blood and dermal eosinophilia are often seen. lymphoma cells have also been shown to produce il-5 in these disorders. other types of lymphoid malignancies have been associated with eosinophilia, as in lymphoblastic leukemia with a translocation between chromosomes 5 and 14 or alterations in the genes which encode platelet-derived growth factor receptors alpha or beta. patients displaying eosinophilia overexpress a gene encoding an eosinophil hematopoietin. a translocation between chromosomes 5 and 14 in patients with acute b lymphocytic leukemia resulted in the juxtaposition of the il-3 gene and the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene, causing overproduction production of il-3, leading to blood and tissue eosinophilia.


==== primary immunodeficiency diseases ====

primary immunodeficiency diseases are inborn errors in the immune system due to defective genes. certain of these disorders are sometimes or often associated with hypereosinophilia. the list of such disorders includes zap70 deficiency (defective  zap70 gene), cd3gamma chain deficiency (defective cd3g gene), mchii deficiency (defective rfxank gene), wiskott–aldrich syndrome (defective was gene), ipex syndrome (defective ipex gene), cd40 gene defect, and autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (defective fas receptor gene). more than 30 other primary immunodeficiency diseases are sometimes associated with modest increases in eosinophil counts, i.e. eosinophilia. the hyperimmunoglobulin e syndrome is associated with hypereosionphilia or eosinophilia due to mutations in any one of the following genes: stat3, dock8, pgm3, spink5, and tyk2 (see mutations in the hymperimmoglobulin e syndrome). omenn syndrome is a severe combined immunodeficiency disease characterized by skin rash, slenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy due to a causative mutation in rag1, rag2, or, more rarely, one of several other genes.


==== lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia ====

lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia is a disorder attributed to the expansion of a cytokine-producing, aberrant population of a particular t-cell phenotype. the disorder is clonal with regard to the
production of abnormal t-cell lymphocytes not eosinophils which appear phenotypically normal. the phenotypically aberrant lymphocytes function abnormally by stimulating the proliferation and maturation of bone marrow eosinophil-precursor cells which in studied cases appears due to their excess production of interleukin 5, interleukin 3, or interleukin 13. the disorder is usually indolent but infrequently progresses to t-cell lymphoma or sezary syndrome. accumulation of partial deletions in the short arm of chromosome 6, the long arm of chromosome 10, or the acquirement of an extra chromosome (i.e. trisomy) 7) in t-cells or the proliferation of lymphocytes with the cd3 negative, cd41 positive immunophenotype may occur during the disorders progression to lymphoma. reports on treatment of the disorder are rare. in on study of 16 lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia patients with the aberrant cd3 negative, cd41 positive immunophenotype, good responds to corticosteroid drugs were uniform but 16 ultimately required corticosteroid-sparing agents. hydroxyurea and imatinib are less likely to have efficacy in this variant of hypereosinophilia than in many cases of clonal eosinophilia or chronic eosinophilic leukemia.


==== gleich's syndrome ====

gleich's syndrome, which may be a form of lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia, involves hypereosinophilia, elevated blood levels of igm antibodies, and clonal expansion of t cells. similar to lymphocyte=variant hypereosinophilia, the increased levels of blood eosinophils in gleich's syndrome is thought to be secondary to the secretion of eosinophil-stimulating cytokines by a t cell clones.


==== igg4-related disease ====

igg4-related disease or immunoglobulin g4-related disease is a condition dacryoadenitis, sialadenitis, lymphadentitis, and pancreatitis (i.e. inflammation of the lacrimal glands, salivary glands, lymph nodes, and pancreas, respectively) plus retroperitoneal fibrosis. less commonly, almost any other organ or tissue except joints and brain may be beleaguered by the inflammatory disorder. about 1/3 of cases exhibit eosinophilia or, rarely, hypereosinophilia. this increase in blood eosinophil count is often associated with abnormal t-lymphocyte clones (e.g. increased numbers of cd4 negative, cd7 positive t cells, cd3 negative, cd4 positive t cells, or cd3 positive, cd4 negative, cd8 negative t cells) and is thought to be secondary to these immunological disturbances. the disorder often exhibits are recurrent-relapsing course and is highly responsive to corticosteroids or rituximab as first-line therapy and interferon gamma as second-line therapy.


==== angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia ====

angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia is a disorder initially classified as a form of igg4-related diseases but now considered a distinct entity. the disorder involves inflamed benign tumors of the vasculature in skin and, less commonly, other tissues. the tumors consist of histiocytoid endothelial cells prominently infiltrated by lymphocytes and eosinophils and is associated with hypereosinophilia or eosinophilia.


==== cholesterol embolism ====

transient, fluctuating hypereosinophilia occurs in 60%-80% of individuals suffering cholesterol embolisms. in this disorder, cholesterol crystals located in an atherosclerotic plaque of a large artery dislodge, travel downstream in the blood, and clog smaller arteries. this results in obstructive damage to multiple organs and tissues. afflicted tissues exhibit acute inflammation involving eosinophils, neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. the cause for this hypereosinophilic response is not known.


==== adrenal insufficiency ====
a class of steroid hormones secreted by the adrenal gland, glucocorticoids, inhibit eosinophil proliferation and survival. in adrenal insufficiency, low levels of these hormones allow increased eosinophil proliferation and survival. this leads to increases in blood eosinophil levels, typically eosinophilia and, less commonly, hypereosinophilia.


=== organ-restricted hypereosinophilias ===
hypereosinophilia may occur in the setting of damage to a single specific organ due to a massive infiltration by eosinophils. this disorder is sub-classified based on the organ involved and is not considered to be a form of primary hypereosinophilia, secondary hypereosinophilia, or the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome because: a) the eosinophils associated with the disorder have not been shown to be clonal in nature; b) a reason for the increase in blood eosinophils has not been determined; c) organ damage has not been shown to be due to eosinophils; and d) the disorder in each individual case typically is limited to the afflicted organ. examples of organ-restricted hypereosinopilia include eosinophilic myocarditis, eosinophilic esophagitis, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, eosinophilic cystitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, eosinophilic fasciitis, eosinophilic folliculitis, eosinophilic cellulitis, eosinophilic vasculitis, and eosinophilic ulcer of the oral mucosa. other examples of organ-restricted hepereosinophilia include those involving the heart, kidney, liver, colon, pulmonary pleurae, peritoneum, fat tissue, myometrium, and synovia.


== treatment ==
treatment is directed toward the underlying cause. however, in primary eosinophilia, or if the eosinophil count must be lowered, corticosteroids such as prednisone may be used. however, immune suppression, the mechanism of action of corticosteroids, can be fatal in patients with parasitosis.


== list of causes ==
eosinophilia can be idiopathic (primary) or, more commonly, secondary to another disease. in the western world, allergic or atopic diseases are the most common causes, especially those of the respiratory or integumentary systems. in the developing world, parasites are the most common cause. a parasitic infection of nearly any bodily tissue can cause eosinophilia.

transitional myocyte,cell,"a myocyte (also known as a muscle cell) is the type of cell found in some types of muscle tissue. myocytes develop from myoblasts to form muscles in a process known as myogenesis. there are two specialized forms of myocytes with distinct properties: cardiac, and smooth muscle cells. on the other hand, skeletal muscles are formed by morphological units referred to as muscle fibers. cardiomyocytes are the cells that form the chambers of the heart, and have a single central nucleus. skeletal muscle fibers help support and move the body and are called syncytia  – multinucleated structures formed by fusion of individual myoblasts during embryonic development. smooth muscle cells control involuntary movements such as the peristalsis contractions in the oesophagus and stomach.


== structure ==


=== terminology ===
the unusual microstructure of muscle cells has led cell biologists to create specialized terminology. however, each term specific to muscle cells has a counterpart that is used in the terminology applied to other types of cells:

the sarcoplasm is the cytoplasm of a muscle fiber/cell. most of the sarcoplasm is filled with myofibrils, which are long protein cords composed of myofilaments. the sarcoplasm is also composed of glycogen, a polysaccharide of glucose monomers, which provides energy to the cell with heightened exercise, and myoglobin, the red pigment that stores oxygen until needed for muscular activity.there are three types of myofilaments:
thick filaments, composed of protein molecules called myosin. in striations of muscle bands, these are the dark filaments that make up the a band.
thin filaments are composed of protein molecules called actin. in striations of muscle bands, these are the light filaments that make up the i band.
elastic filaments are composed of titin, a large springy protein; these filaments anchor the thick filaments to the z disc.together, these myofilaments work to produce a muscle contraction.
the sarcoplasmic reticulum, a specialized type of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, forms a network around each myofibril of the muscle fiber. this network is composed of groupings of two dilated end-sacs called terminal cisternae, and a single transverse tubule, or t tubule, which bores through the cell and emerge on the other side; together these three components form the triads that exist within the network of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, in which each t tubule has two terminal cisternae on each side of it. the sarcoplasmic reticulum serves as reservoir for calcium ions, so when an action potential spreads over the t tubule, it signals the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions from the gated membrane channels to stimulate a muscle contraction.the sarcolemma was historically synonymous with the cell membrane of a striated muscle fiber or muscle cell. however, there are two other components which form the sarcolemma - basal lamina and reticular fibers. the cell membrane of the sarcolemma receives and conducts stimuli. in skeletal muscle, at the end of each muscle fiber, the outer layer of the sarcolemma combines with tendon fibers. within the muscle fiber pressed against the sarcolemma are multiple flattened nuclei; embryologically, this multinuclear condition results from multiple myoblasts fusing to produce each muscle fiber, where each myoblast contributes one nucleus.


=== internal ===

the cell membrane of a myocyte has several specialized regions, which may include the intercalated disk and the transverse tubular system. the cell membrane is covered by a lamina coat which is approximately 50 nm wide. the laminar coat is separable into two layers; the lamina densa and lamina lucida. in between these two layers can be several different types of ions, including calcium.the cell membrane is anchored to the cell's cytoskeleton by anchor fibers that are approximately 10 nm wide.  these are generally located at the z lines so that they form grooves and transverse tubules emanate. in cardiac myocytes this forms a scalloped surface.the cytoskeleton is what the rest of the cell builds off of and has two primary purposes; the first is to stabilize the topography of the intracellular components and the second is to help control the size and shape of the cell. while the first function is important for biochemical processes, the latter is crucial in defining the surface to volume ratio of the cell. this heavily influences the potential electrical properties of excitable cells. additionally deviation from the standard shape and size of the cell can have negative prognostic impact.


=== myofibrils ===

each muscle fiber contains myofibrils, which are very long chains of sarcomeres, the contractile units of the cell. a cell from the biceps brachii muscle may contain 80,000 sarcomeres. the myofibrils of smooth muscle cells are not arranged into sarcomeres.  the sarcomeres are composed of thin and thick filaments.  thin filaments are made of actin and attach at z lines which help them line up correctly with each other. troponins are found at intervals along the thin filaments. thick filaments are made of the elongated protein myosin. the sarcomere does not contain organelles or a nucleus. sarcomeres are marked by z lines which show the beginning and the end of a sarcomere. individual myocytes are surrounded by endomysium.
myocytes are bound together by perimysium into bundles called muscle fascicle; the bundles are then grouped together to form muscle tissue, which is enclosed in a sheath of epimysium. the perimysium contains blood vessels and nerves which provide for the muscle fibers. muscle spindles are distributed throughout the muscles and provide sensory feedback information to the central nervous system. myosin is shaped like a long shaft with a rounded end pointed out towards the surface. this structure forms the cross bridge that connects with the thin filaments.


== development ==

a myoblast is a type of embryonic progenitor cell that differentiates to give rise to muscle cells. differentiation is regulated by myogenic regulatory factors, including myod, myf5, myogenin, and mrf4. gata4 and gata6 also play a role in myocyte differentiation.skeletal muscle fibers are made when myoblasts fuse together; muscle fibers therefore are cells with multiple nuclei, known as myonuclei, with each cell nucleus originating from a single myoblast. the fusion of myoblasts is specific to skeletal muscle (e.g., biceps brachii) and not cardiac muscle or smooth muscle.
myoblasts in skeletal muscle that do not form muscle fibers dedifferentiate back into myosatellite cells. these satellite cells remain adjacent to a skeletal muscle fiber, situated between the sarcolemma and the basement membrane of the endomysium (the connective tissue investment that divides the muscle fascicles into individual fibers). to re-activate myogenesis, the satellite cells must be stimulated to differentiate into new fibers.
myoblasts and their derivatives, including satellite cells, can now be generated in vitro through directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells.kindlin-2 plays a role in developmental elongation during myogenesis.


=== muscle fiber growth ===
muscle fibers grow when exercised and shrink when not in use. this is due to the fact that exercise stimulates the increase in myofibrils which increase the overall size of muscle cells. well exercised muscles can not only add more size but can also develop more mitochondria, myoglobin, glycogen and a higher density of capillaries. however muscle cells cannot divide to produce new cells, and as a result we have fewer muscle cells as an adult than a newborn.


== function ==


=== muscle contraction ===

when contracting, thin and thick filaments slide with respect to each other by using adenosine triphosphate.  this pulls the z discs closer together in a process called sliding filament mechanism.  the contraction of all the sarcomeres results in the contraction of the whole muscle fiber. this contraction of the myocyte is triggered by the action potential over the cell membrane of the myocyte. the action potential uses transverse tubules to get from the surface to the interior of the myocyte, which is continuous within the cell membrane.
sarcoplasmic reticula are membranous bags that transverse tubules touch but remain separate from. these wrap themselves around each sarcomere and are filled with ca2+.excitation of a myocyte causes depolarization at its synapses, the neuromuscular junctions, which triggers action potential. with a singular neuromuscular junction, each muscle fiber receives input from just one somatic efferent neuron. action potential in a somatic efferent neuron causes the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.when the acetylcholine is released it diffuses across the synapse and binds to a receptor on the sarcolemma, a term unique to muscle cells that refers to the cell membrane. this initiates an impulse that travels across the sarcolemma.when the action potential reaches the sarcoplasmic reticulum it triggers the release of ca2+ from the ca2+ channels. the ca2+ flows from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the sarcomere with both of its filaments. this causes the filaments to start sliding and the sarcomeres to become shorter. this requires a large amount of atp, as it is used in both the attachment and release of every myosin head. very quickly ca2+ is actively transported back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which blocks the interaction between the thin and thick filament. this in turn causes the muscle cell to relax.


=== kinds of contraction ===
there are four main different types of muscle contraction: twitch, treppe, tetanus and isometric/isotonic. twitch contraction is the process in which a single stimulus signals for a single contraction. in twitch contraction the length of the contraction may vary depending on the size of the muscle cell. during treppe (or summation) contraction muscles do not start at maximum efficiency; instead they achieve increased strength of contraction due to repeated stimuli. tetanus involves a sustained contraction of muscles due to a series of rapid stimuli, which can continue until the muscles fatigue.  isometric contractions are skeletal muscle contractions that do not cause movement of the muscle. however, isotonic contractions are skeletal muscle contractions that do cause movement.specialized cardiomyocytes located in the sinoatrial node are responsible for generating the electrical impulses that control the heart rate.  these electrical impulses coordinate contraction throughout the remaining heart muscle via the electrical conduction system of the heart.  sinoatrial node activity is modulated, in turn, by nerve fibres of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.  these systems act to increase and decrease, respectively, the rate of production of electrical impulses by the sinoatrial node.


== fiber typing ==

there are numerous methods employed for fiber-typing, and confusion between the methods is common among non-experts. two commonly confused methods are histochemical staining for myosin atpase activity and immunohistochemical staining for myosin heavy chain (mhc) type.  myosin atpase activity is commonly—and correctly—referred to as simply ""fiber type"", and results from the direct assaying of atpase activity under various conditions (e.g. ph). myosin heavy chain staining is most accurately referred to as ""mhc fiber type"", e.g. ""mhc iia fibers"", and results from determination of different mhc isoforms.  these methods are closely related physiologically, as the mhc type is the primary determinant of atpase activity.  note, however, that neither of these typing methods is directly metabolic in nature; they do not directly address oxidative or glycolytic capacity of the fiber.
when ""type i"" or ""type ii"" fibers are referred to generically, this most accurately refers to the sum of numerical fiber types (i vs. ii) as assessed by myosin atpase activity staining (e.g. ""type ii"" fibers refers to type iia + type iiax + type iixa ... etc.).
below is a table showing the relationship between these two methods, limited to fiber types found in humans. note the sub-type capitalization used in fiber typing vs. mhc typing, and that some atpase types actually contain multiple mhc types.  also, a subtype b or b is not expressed in humans by either method. early researchers believed humans to express a mhc iib, which led to the atpase classification of iib. however, later research showed that the human mhc iib was in fact iix, indicating that the iib is better named iix. iib is expressed in other mammals, so is still accurately seen (along with iib) in the literature.  non human fiber types include true iib fibers, iic, iid, etc.

further fiber typing methods are less formally delineated, and exist on more of a spectrum. they tend to be focused more on metabolic and functional capacities (i.e., oxidative vs. glycolytic, fast vs. slow contraction time). as noted above, fiber typing by atpase or mhc does not directly measure or dictate these parameters. however, many of the various methods are mechanistically linked, while others are correlated in vivo. for instance, atpase fiber type is related to contraction speed, because high atpase activity allows faster crossbridge cycling. while atpase activity is only one component of contraction speed, type i fibers are ""slow"", in part, because they have low speeds of atpase activity in comparison to type ii fibers. however, measuring contraction speed is not the same as atpase fiber typing.
because of these types of relationships, type i and type ii fibers have relatively distinct metabolic, contractile, and motor-unit properties. the table below differentiates these types of properties. these types of properties—while they are partly dependent on the properties of individual fibers—tend to be relevant and measured at the level of the motor unit, rather than individual fiber.
fiber color
traditionally, fibers were categorized depending on their varying color, which is a reflection of myoglobin content. type i fibers appear red due to the high levels of myoglobin. red muscle fibers tend to have more mitochondria and greater local capillary density. these fibers are more suited for endurance and are slow to fatigue because they use oxidative metabolism to generate atp (adenosine triphosphate). less oxidative type ii fibers are white due to relatively low myoglobin and a reliance on glycolytic enzymes.

twitch speed
fibers can also be classified on their twitch capabilities, into fast and slow twitch. these traits largely, but not completely, overlap the classifications based on color, atpase, or mhc.
some authors define a fast twitch fiber as one in which the myosin can split atp very quickly.  these mainly include the atpase type ii and mhc type ii fibers.  however, fast twitch fibers also demonstrate a higher capability for electrochemical transmission of action potentials and a rapid level of calcium release and uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. the fast twitch fibers rely on a well-developed, anaerobic, short term, glycolytic system for energy transfer and can contract and develop tension at 2–3 times the rate of slow twitch fibers. fast twitch muscles are much better at generating short bursts of strength or speed than slow muscles, and so fatigue more quickly.the slow twitch fibers generate energy for atp re-synthesis by means of a long term system of aerobic energy transfer. these mainly include the atpase type i and mhc type i fibers. they tend to have a low activity level of atpase, a slower speed of contraction with a less well developed glycolytic capacity. they contain high mitochondrial volumes, and the high levels of myoglobin that give them a red pigmentation. they have been demonstrated to have high concentrations of mitochondrial enzymes, thus they are fatigue resistant. slow twitch muscles fire more slowly than fast twitch fibers, but are able to contract for a longer time before fatiguing.
type distribution
individual muscles tend to be a mixture of various fiber types, but their proportions vary depending on the actions of that muscle and the species. for instance, in humans, the quadriceps muscles contain ~52% type i fibers, while the soleus is ~80% type i. the orbicularis oculi muscle of the eye is only ~15% type i.  motor units within the muscle, however, have minimal variation between the fibers of that unit.  it is this fact that makes the size principal of motor unit recruitment viable.
the total number of skeletal muscle fibers has traditionally been thought not to change.
it is believed there are no sex or age differences in fiber distribution; however, proportions of fiber types vary considerably from muscle to muscle and person to person.
sedentary men and women (as well as young children) have 45% type ii and 55% type i fibers.
people at the higher end of any sport tend to demonstrate patterns of fiber distribution e.g. endurance athletes show a higher level of type i fibers.
sprint athletes, on the other hand, require large numbers of type iix fibers.
middle distance event athletes show approximately equal distribution of the two types. this is also often the case for power athletes such as throwers and jumpers.
it has been suggested that various types of exercise can induce changes in the fibers of a skeletal muscle.it is thought that if you perform endurance type events for a sustained period of time, some of the type iix fibers transform into type iia fibers. however, there is no consensus on the subject.
it may well be that the type iix fibers show enhancements of the oxidative capacity after high intensity endurance training which brings them to a level at which they are able to perform oxidative metabolism as effectively as slow twitch fibers of untrained subjects. this would be brought about by an increase in mitochondrial size and number and the associated related changes, not a change in fiber type.

"(2r,3s,2's)-nadolol",reagent,"nadolol, sold under the brand name corgard among others, is a medication used to treat high blood pressure, heart pain, and atrial fibrillation. it has also been used to prevent migraine headaches and complications of cirrhosis. it is taken orally.common side effects include dizziness, feeling tired, a slow heart rate, and raynaud syndrome. serious side effects may include heart failure and bronchospasm. its use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is of unclear safety. it is a non-selective beta blocker and works by blocking β1-adrenergic receptors in the heart and β2-adrenergic receptors in blood vessels.nadolol was patented in 1970 and came into medical use in 1978. it is available as a generic medication. in 2016, it was the 283rd most commonly prescribed medication in the united states, with more than a million prescriptions.


== medical uses ==
nadolol is used to treat hypertension and for long-term treatment of angina pectoris and is approved by the fda for these purposes.it is regularly used off-label for control of heart rate in people with atrial fibrillation, prevention of migraine headaches; prevention of bleeding veins in people with portal hypertension caused by cirrhosis; and to treat people with high levels of thyroid hormone.nadolol is one of the preferred beta-blockers in the management of patients with lqts for shortening of the qt interval and prevention of ventricular arrhythmia. it is more efficacious than cardioselective beta-blockers like metoprolol and propanolol in the prevention of breakthrough cardiac events. nadolol has the advantage of once daily dosing and thus improved patient compliance. for patients with decreased kidney function, nadolol may be dosed less often. it has also been found to be useful (off-label) for several neurological disorders such as the prevention of migraine attacks, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder(adhd) and its use has been explored as a treatment for essential tremor and parkinson's disease but neither is well established.


== side effects ==
the most common side effects include dizziness and fatigue.


== contraindications ==
nadolol and other beta blockers should be used with cautions in people with heart failure and its use should not be abruptly stopped.  it is contraindicated for people with asthma, a slow heart rate and certain severe heart problems.


== mechanism of action ==

nadolol is a non-selective beta blocker; that is, it non-selectively blocks both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors. it has a preference for beta-1 receptors, which are predominantly located in the heart, thereby inhibiting the effects of catecholamines and causing a decrease in heart rate and blood pressure. its inhibition of beta-2 receptors, which are mainly located in the bronchial smooth muscle of the airways, leads to airway constriction similar to that seen in asthma. inhibition of beta-1 receptors in the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidney inhibits the renin–angiotensin system, causing a decrease in vasoconstriction and a decrease in water retention. nadolol's inhibition of beta-1 receptors in the heart and kidney leads to its effects on lowering blood pressure.
the drug impairs av node conduction and decreases sinus rate.
nadolol may also increase plasma triglycerides and decrease hdl-cholesterol levels.


== chemistry ==
nadolol is a mixture of stereoisomers. it is polar and hydrophilic, with low lipid solubility.

gln-arg-pro,reagent,"growth hormone–releasing hormone (ghrh), also known as somatocrinin or by several other names in its endogenous forms and as somatorelin (inn) in its pharmaceutical form, is a releasing hormone of growth hormone (gh). it is a 44-amino acid peptide hormone produced in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus.
ghrh first appears in the human hypothalamus between 18 and 29 weeks of gestation, which corresponds to the start of production of growth hormone and other somatotropes in fetuses.


== nomenclature ==
endogenous:
somatocrinin
somatoliberin
growth hormone–releasing hormone (ghrh or gh-rh; hgnc symbol is ghrh)
growth hormone–releasing factor (ghrf or grf)
somatotropin-releasing hormone (srh)
somatotropin-releasing factor (srf)
pharmaceutical:
somatorelin (inn)


== origin ==
ghrh is released from neurosecretory nerve terminals of these arcuate neurons, and is carried by the hypothalamo-hypophyseal portal system to the anterior pituitary gland, where it stimulates growth hormone (gh) secretion by stimulating the growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor. ghrh is released in a pulsatile manner, stimulating similar pulsatile release of gh.  in addition, ghrh also promotes slow-wave sleep directly. growth hormone is required for normal postnatal growth, bone growth, regulatory effects on protein, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism.


== effect ==
ghrh stimulates gh production and release by binding to the ghrh receptor (ghrhr) on cells in the anterior pituitary.


=== receptor ===

the ghrhr is a member of the secretin family of g protein-coupled receptors, and is located on chromosome 7 in humans. this protein is transmembranous with seven folds, and its molecular weight is approximately 44 kd.


=== signal transduction ===
ghrh binding to ghrhr results in increased gh production mainly by the camp-dependent pathway, but also by the phospholipase c pathway (ip3/dag pathway), and other minor pathways.the camp-dependent pathway is initiated by the binding of ghrh to its receptor, causing receptor conformation that activates gs alpha subunit of the closely associated g-protein complex on the intracellular side. this results in stimulation of membrane-bound adenylyl cyclase and increased intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp). camp binds to and activates the regulatory subunits of protein kinase a (pka), allowing the free catalytic subunits to translocate to the nucleus and phosphorylate the transcription factor camp response element-binding protein (creb). phosphorylated creb, together with its coactivators, p300 and creb-binding protein (cbp) enhances the transcription of gh by binding to cres camp-response elements in the promoter region of the gh gene. it also increases transcription of the ghrhr gene, providing positive feedback.in the phospholipase c pathway, ghrh stimulates phospholipase c (plc) through the βγ-complex of heterotrimeric g-proteins. plc activation produces both diacylglycerol (dag) and inositol triphosphate (ip3), the latter leading to release of intracellular ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum, increasing cytosolic ca2+ concentration, resulting in vesicle fusion and release of secretory vesicles containing premade growth hormone.some ca2+ influx is also a direct action of camp, which is distinct from the usual camp-dependent pathway of activating protein kinase a.activation of ghrhrs by ghrh also conveys opening of na+ channels by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, causing cell depolarization. the resultant change in the intracellular voltage opens a voltage-dependent calcium channel, resulting in vesicle fusion and release of gh.


== relationship of ghrh and somatostatin ==
the actions of ghrh are opposed by somatostatin (growth-hormone-inhibiting hormone). somatostatin is released from neurosecretory nerve terminals of periventricular somatostatin neurons, and is carried by the hypothalamo-hypophysial portal circulation to the anterior pituitary where it inhibits gh secretion. somatostatin and ghrh are secreted in alternation, giving rise to the markedly pulsatile secretion of gh.


== other functions ==
ghrh expression has been demonstrated in peripheral cells and tissues outside its main site in the hypothalamus, for example, in the pancreas, epithelial mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract and, pathologically, in tumour cells.


== sequence ==
the amino acid sequence (44 long) of human ghrh is:
ho - tyr - ala - asp - ala - ile - phe - thr - asn - ser - tyr - arg - lys - val - leu - gly - gln - leu - ser - ala - arg - lys - leu - leu - gln - asp - ile - met - ser - arg - gln - gln - gly - glu - ser - asn - gln - glu - arg - gly - ala - arg - ala - arg - leu - nh2


== analogs ==
growth-hormone-releasing hormone is the lead compound for a number of structural and functional analogs, such as pro-pro-hghrh(1-44)-gly-gly-cys, cjc-1293, and cjc-1295.many ghrh analogs remain primarily research chemicals, although some have specific applications. sermorelin, a functional peptide fragment of ghrh, has been used in the diagnosis of deficiencies in growth hormone secretion.  tesamorelin, under the trade name egrifta, received u.s. food and drug administration approval in 2010 for the treatment of lipodystrophy in hiv patients under highly active antiretroviral therapy, and, in 2011, was investigated for effects on certain cognitive tests in the elderly. as a category, the use of ghrh analogs by professional athletes may be prohibited by restrictions on doping in sport because they act as growth hormone secretagogues.

piperacillin-sulbactam,antibiotic,"piperacillin is a broad-spectrum β-lactam antibiotic of the ureidopenicillin class. the chemical structure of piperacillin and other ureidopenicillins incorporates a polar side chain that enhances penetration into gram-negative bacteria and reduces susceptibility to cleavage by gram-negative beta lactamase enzymes. these properties confer activity against the important hospital pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa. thus piperacillin is sometimes referred to as an ""anti-pseudomonal penicillin"".
when used alone, piperacillin lacks strong activity against the gram-positive pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus, as the beta-lactam ring is hydrolyzed by the bacteria's beta-lactamase.it was patented in 1974 and approved for medical use in 1981. piperacillin is most commonly used in combination with the beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam (piperacillin/tazobactam), which enhances piperacillin's effectiveness by inhibiting many beta lactamases to which it is susceptible.  however, the co-administration of tazobactam does not confer activity against mrsa, as penicillin (and most other beta lactams) do not avidly bind to the penicillin-binding proteins of this pathogen. the world health organization classifies piperacillin as critically important for human medicine.


== medical uses ==
piperacillin is used almost exclusively in combination with the beta lactamase inhibitor tazobactam for the treatment of serious, hospital-acquired infections. this combination is among the most widely used drug therapies in united states non-federal hospitals, accounting for $388m in spending in spite of being a low-cost generic drug.piperacillin-tazobactam is recommended as part of a three drug regimen for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia suspected as being due to infection by multi-drug resistant pathogens.  it is also one of several antibacterial drugs recommended for the treatment of infections known to be caused by anaerobic gram-negative rods.piperacillin-tazobactam is recommended by the national institute for health and care excellence as initial empiric treatment for people with suspected neutropenic sepsis.piperacillin is used to treat patients diagnosed with various internal infections such as abdominal, bacteremia, gynecological, respiratory, and urinary, mainly caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa and other infectious bacteria. they are primarily used in current and former neutropenic patients, and patients with biliary tract infections. other uses include applications in surgical infection prophylaxis; in biliary surgery, a single dose of piperacillin is administered intravenously to inhibit the development of acute cholangitis and prevent wound infections. the combination of piperacillin and an aminoglycoside is commonly used to treat severe infections, but due to the incompatibilities in drug interaction, they are administered separately.


=== pneumonia ===
the piperacillin-tazobactam (piptaz) antibiotic commonly used with an aminoglycoside retains similar levels of drug safety and efficacy as other antibiotic combinations such as ceftazidime with the aminoglycoside tobramycin in the treatment of patients with hospital acquired pneumonia. in a clinical comparison primarily targeting patients not initially placed in intensive care units, piperacillin-tazobactam was found to produce higher clinical and microbiological rates of success. by contrast, the drug efficacy of ceftazidime and piperacillin-tazobactam resulted in similar response rates (61.5% and 63.9 respectively) when tobramycin was added into both groups. identical evaluations are shown when compared to the imipenem and tobramycin combination, where the administration of piperacillin-tazobactam on patients (especially those under mechanical ventilation) was only consisted of a slightly higher response rate.


== administration ==
piperacillin is not absorbed orally, and must therefore be given by intravenous or intramuscular injection. it has been shown that the bactericidal actions of the drug do not increase with concentrations of piperacillin higher than 4-6 x mic, which means that the drug is concentration-independent in terms of its actions. piperacillin has instead shown to offer higher bactericidal activity when its concentration remains above the mic for longer periods of time (50% time>mic showing the highest activity). this higher activity present in continuous dosing has not been directly linked to clinical outcomes, but however does show promise of lowering possibility of resistance and decreasing mortality.extending the time of piperacillin-tazobactam infusion allows the drugs to maintain the necessary concentrations needed within the body to prevent bacterial growth, enhancing bactericidal activity. the studies supporting this theory generally administered ~3.375g of piperacillin-tazobactam every 8 hours during a 4-hour infusion, while for organisms with higher minimum inhibitory concentrations, ~4.5g of piperacillin-tazobactam was administered every 6 hours during a 3-hour infusion.the recommended doses provided by the bnfc for infants with hospital-acquired infections are 90mg/kg every 8 hours for infants, a maximum of 4.5g every 6 hours for children, and 4.5g every 8 hours for children aged 12 and above. a dosage of 90mg/kg every 6 hours is suggested for infants and children diagnosed with neutropenia.


== adverse effects ==
common side effects associated with the administration of piperacillin-tazobactam include:
gastrointestinal: constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting
dermatologic: erythema, pain, phlebitis, rash
neurologic: headaches, insomniaprolonged periods of piperacillin-tazobactam therapy have been associated with the potential development of hematologic adversities such as leukopenia (16.3%), neutropenia (10%), and eosinophilia (10%) in adult patients. the combination of piperacillin-tazobactam with other antibiotics was found to be a major risk factor for leukopenia as well. additionally, the chances of developing these illnesses increases in younger patients suffering from fewer conditions, prolonging their time to recover.other cases of adverse effects include instances of renal dysfunction, hepatitis, hyperactivity, anemia, abnormalities in coagulation, and hypokalemia. allergic reactions can be induced from the side chains of β-lactam antibiotics such as amoxicillin, or antibodies surrounding the nucleus of penicillin.


== interactions ==
the combination of piperacillin and tazobactam, commonly branded as zosyn, improves their overall bactericidal activity as amino-benzylpenicillins and ureidopencillins work synergistically with β-lactamase inhibitors. concurrent use or unregulated dosages of piperacillin results in increasing levels of piperacillin within the body, prolonging neuromuscular transmission blockages created by non-depolarizing muscle relaxants, and disruptions in urine tests for glucose. some compounds that may interfere with the bactericidal activity of piperacillin include chloramphenicol, macrolides, and sulfonamides.
following two studies conducted in 1986 and 2006, piperacillin was found to inhibit the removal of methotrexate in animal kidneys. furthermore, in the presence of piperacillin-tazobactam, the decay time for methotrexate triples in comparison to the normal half-life, leaving the patient exposed to cytotoxic effects produced by the chemical agent. while penicillin antibiotics generally work synergistically with aminoglycosides by enhancing their penetration of bacterial membranes, they can also work adversely by inactivating them. a reformulation of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and piperacillin-tazobactam has produced results showing an increase in their affinity with amikacin and gentamicin in vitro, enabling the process of simultaneous y-site infusion to occur. however, tobramycin was found to be incompatible as a combination through y-site infusion.


== pharmacology ==
piperacillin irreversibly binds to the enzyme penicillin-binding proteins, inhibiting the biosynthesis of bacterial cell walls.


=== mechanism of action ===
as a β-lactam antibiotic, piperacillin inhibits penicillin-binding proteins, preventing the spread of bacteria and infections. responsible for catalyzing the cross-linkage between peptidoglycan strands that protect the bacterial cell from osmotic rupture, penicillin-binding proteins are unique to bacterial organisms, where every known bacteria with a peptidoglycan cell wall consists of homologous sub-families. by sharing a similar stereochemistry with the substrates that bind to penicillin-binding proteins, piperacillin is able to bind to serine residues found at the active site of the enzyme through the formation of a covalent complex, preventing other substrates from binding. moreover, this leads to the release of autolysins that break down the bacteria’s cell wall.some β-lactamase enzymes also consist of residue at their active site, enabling them to hydrolyze the β-lactam ring found within these antibiotics. however, this hydrolytic activity is inhibited when piperacillin works in conjunction with tazobactam. tazobactam binds to these enzymes to form a stable acyl-enzyme complex; similar to one formed during the hydrolysis of the β-lactam ring. thus, protecting piperacillin from hydrolysis.the inclusion of a β-lactamase inhibitor does not always increase drug efficacy. some bacteria may produce certain types of β-lactamase such as ampc, which are intrinsically resistant to tazobactam.


=== mechanisms of resistance ===
a major mechanism of resistance against piperacillin-tazobactam is gram-negative bacteria producing β-lactamases. other currently known mechanisms include mutations in the active site of penicillin-binding proteins, changes in membrane efflux, or bacteria permeability. some enzymes, such as extended-spectrum β-lactamase (esbl) have evolved from narrow-spectrum β-lactamases due to genetic mutations, increasing their capabilities to hydrolyze much broader spectrum penicillin. due to prior conflicting reports on the drug’s affinity with esbl-producing bacteria, piperacillin-tazobactam treatment for such is not recommended. antibiotic resistance occurs sporadically, conferred by the continuous use of piperacillin-tazobactam in situations where it may prove to be ineffective, leading to cases where plasmid-mediated β-lactamases are being produced in bacteria that do not naturally produce it.some gram-positive bacteria penicillin-binding proteins such as enterococcus faecium (pbp-5) or staphylococcus aureus (pbp-2a) are intrinsically antibiotic resistant, consisting of relatively low affinity with piperacillin and therefore high resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam. furthermore, mutations in penicillin-binding proteins cause fluctuations in piperacillin affinity, whereas streptococcus pneumoniae (pbp-2b) autolytic response is significantly reduced due to decreased affinity with piperacillin. although membrane permeability changes are less common as a mechanism of resistance, studies investigating klebsiella pneumoniae have reported a correlation between decreased permeability of piperacillin and increased shv-1 β-lactamase production.


=== pharmacokinetics ===
piperacillin is generally available in their stable form as crystalized potassium or sodium salt, quickly losing bactericidal activity upon dissolution due to their short half-lives. as the gastrointestinal tract does not absorb piperacillin and tazobactam, they are dissolved in a solution before being administered to a patient, through parenteral means. excreted through renal mechanisms like glomerular or tubular filtration as a component of urine, uncontrolled dosages of the drug can cause renal dysfunction and competitive inhibition of excretion, delaying piperacillin-tazobactam excretion, and endangering patients to drug exposure.

although the distribution of the drug remained the same, the half-life for elimination increased by three to five folds for patients diagnosed with renal dysfunction. measured by creatinine clearance (crcl), patients with less than 30ml/min of clearance had significantly reduced levels of piperacillin/tazobactam excretion, measuring down to 35% of the initial dosage, while the area under the curve (auc) for piperacillin increased by about three folds for those with less than 20ml/min. a reduced dosage or alteration in the interval of administration is recommended for patients lying under 40ml/min of crcl, depending on the severity of dysfunction.
renal is the main pathway for drug elimination for both tazobactam and piperacillin in the body. while there are other non-renal means of drug elimination like hepatobiliary excretion, they occur less frequently. a substantial amount (~80%) of piperacillin found in urine when excreted through glomerular and tubular filtration is unmetabolized. tazobactam renal elimination may be significantly reduced through piperacillin interaction, dropping from 63.7% to 56.8% of the administered dose over a 24 hour period. piperacillin may be actively diffused through filtration into the biliary tract during renal clearing, indicated by a generally higher concentration of piperacillin than tazobactam in the bile. the metabolites that make up the remaining percentage in the excreted urine are composed of m1 (inactive) and n-desethyl-piperacillin (active), formed from the division of β-lactam rings of both tazobactam and piperacillin respectively.due to the hydrophilic nature of piperacillin-tazobactam, a volume distribution of ~15 l amounting to various sites (tissues) is desired, as hydrophilic compounds are not able to pass through plasma membranes as easily as hydrophobic compounds. concentrations often in the range of 90 mic or above are located in specific areas including the gallbladder, lung, muscle, and skin, making up 16 - 85% of the plasma concentrations. the concentration of piperacillin-tazobactam is especially lower in fatty tissue, making up less than 10% of the plasma concentrations.


=== pharmacodynamics ===
compared to concentration dependent bactericidal antibiotics like aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones, the antibacterial activity of β-lactam antibiotics are generally more time dependent. unlike the former, when piperacillin-tazobactam concentrations exceed minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of a pathogen by five folds, the exponential relationship between concentration and activity begins to level off. otherwise, piperacillin-tazobactam bactericidal efficacy is shown to consist of a strong association with the duration of time the concentration exceeds minimum inhibitory concentrations (t>mic). when the t>mic in the serum equates to 60 - 70% of the frequency for drug administration (dosing interval), maximal activity is achieved against gram-negative bacteria, while for gram-positive bacteria it occurs at around 40 - 50%.within a 24 hour period in one clinical study, a t>mic surpassing 60% was found for piperacillin-susceptible bacteria including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus in two dosing regimes (4.5g every 8 hours and 3.375g every 8 hours).the evidence for this was obtained through monte carlo experiments procured by a special program (optama), where for several different scenarios (e.g. hospital acquired infections, secondary peritonitis, skin or soft tissue infections), the probability of attaining those figures were in the ranges of 85 - 95% and 90 - 89% respectively for the two regimes. in addition, two similar dosing regimes (3.375g and 4.5g every 6 hours) both had lower chances of reaching the 90% t>mic threshold compared to the 50% threshold against hospital acquired pneumonia pathogens.the optimization of piperacillin-tazobactam drug efficiency has been covered by various studies, limiting the focus down to two types of infusions; continuous and intermittent. a comparison using the two administration methods under the same dosage regime of 13.5g per day highlighted no major differences when treating complex intra-abdominal infections. furthermore, a follow-up analyzation of this trial deduced that both methods of administration lead to higher concentrations compared to the mic of the pathogens that were used. similar results are found in a study where a select number of β-lactam susceptible pathogens consisting of enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae and citrobacter freundii were used to test a ~10g every 24 hour dosing interval for continuous infusion.organisms with a piperacillin-tazobactam mic values equal to 32 or less than 16ml/i lead to 50% t>mic when extended-interval intermittent administrations under two different dosing intervals (8.1g and 6.75g every 12 hours) were used against them. the pharmacodynamic target attainments corresponding to pathogens with mic values of 16 mg/i are found to reach 92% when a more traditional 4 hour dosing regime is utilized to administer at irregular intervals. one study using the monte carlo simulation produced contradicting results to the previous studies, deducing that inadequate pharmacodynamic targets were achieved (t>mic > 50%) for similar esbl-producing bacteria, applying to both continuous and high dosage intermittent infusion.


== chemistry ==

derived from “the addition of a hydrophilic heterocyclic group to the α-amino group of ampicillin”, the structure consists of a thiazolidine ring conjoined to a β-lactam ring contained within several ring compounds. the addition of this substituent increases the compound's affinity to penicillin-binding protein pbp-3, improving activity against gram-negative bacteria, and thus broadening its spectrum of activity. susceptible β-lactamase producing bacteria such as staphylococcus spp. or haemophilus influenzae, the combination of tazobactam (which shares a similar structure to sulbactam, another β-lactamase inhibitor), and piperacillin significantly improves the stability of the drug against β-lactamases.

e3 ubiquitin-protein ligase rnf126,protein,"e3 ubiquitin-protein ligase rnf8 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the rnf8 gene.  rnf8 has activity both in immune system functions and in dna repair.


== function ==
the protein encoded by this gene contains a ring finger motif and an fha domain. this protein has been shown to interact with several class ii ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (e2), including ube2e1/ubch6, ube2e2, and ube2e3, and may act as a ubiquitin ligase (e3) in the ubiquitination of certain nuclear proteins. alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been reported.rnf8 promotes repair of dna damage through three dna repair pathways: homologous recombinational repair (hrr),  non-homologous end joining (nhej), and nucleotide excision repair (ner).  dna damage is considered to be the primary cause of cancer, and deficiency in dna repair can cause mutations leading to cancer.  a deficiency in rnf8 predisposes mice to cancer.


== chromatin remodeling ==
after the occurrence of a double-strand break in dna, the chromatin needs to be relaxed to allow dna repair, either by hrr or by nhej.  there are two pathways that result in chromatin relaxation, one initiated by parp1 and one initiated by γh2ax (the phosphorylated form of the h2ax protein) (see chromatin remodeling).  chromatin remodeling initiated by γh2ax depends on rnf8, as described below.
the histone variant h2ax constitutes about 10% of the h2a histones in human chromatin.  at the site of a dna double-strand break, the extent of chromatin with phosphorylated γh2ax is about two million base pairs.γh2ax does not, by itself, cause chromatin decondensation, but within seconds of irradiation the protein “mediator of the dna damage checkpoint 1” (mdc1) specifically attaches to γh2ax.   this is accompanied by simultaneous accumulation of rnf8 protein and the dna repair protein nbs1 which bind to mdc1.  rnf8 mediates extensive chromatin decondensation through its subsequent interaction with chd4 protein, a component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex nurd.


== rnf8 in homologous recombinational repair ==
dna end resection is a pivotal step in hrr repair that produces 3’ overhangs that provide a platform to recruit proteins involved in hrr repair.  the mrn complex, consisting of mre11, rad50 and nbs1, carries out the initial steps of this end resection.  rnf8 ubiquitinates nbs1 (both before and after dna damage occurs), and this ubiquitination is required for effective homologous recombinational repair.  ubiquitination of nbs1 by rnf8 is, however, not required for the role of nbs1 in another dna repair process, the error-prone microhomology-mediated end joining dna repair.rnf8 appears to have other roles in hrr as well.  rnf8, acting as a ubiquitin ligase, mono-ubiquitinates γh2ax to tether dna repair molecules at dna lesions.  in particular, rnf8 activity is required to recruit brca1 for homologous recombination repair.


== rnf8 in non-homologous end joining ==
ku protein is a dimeric protein complex, a heterodimer of two polypeptides, ku70 and ku80.  ku protein forms a ring structure.  an early step in non-homologous end joining dna repair of a double-strand break is the slipping of a ku protein (with its ring protein structure) over each end of the broken dna.  the two ku proteins, one on each broken end, bind to each other and form a bridge.  this protects the dna ends and forms a platform for further dna repair enzymes to operate.  after the broken ends are rejoined, the two ku proteins still encircle the now intact dna and can no longer slip off an end.  the ku proteins must be removed or  they cause loss of cell viability.  the removal of ku protein is performed either by rnf8 ubiquitination of ku80, allowing it to be released from the ku protein ring, or else by nedd8 promoted ubiquitination of ku protein, causing its release from dna.


== rnf8 in nucleotide excision repair ==
uv-induced formation of pyrimidine dimers in dna can lead to cell death unless the lesions are repaired.  most repair of these lesions is by nucleotide excision repair.  after uv-irradiation, rnf8 is recruited to sites of uv-induced dna damage and ubiquitinates chromatin component histone h2a. these responses provide partial protection against uv irradiation.


== impaired spermatogenesis ==
spermatogenesis  is the process in which spermatozoa are produced from spermatogonial stem cells by way of mitosis and meiosis.  a major function of meiosis is homologous recombinational repair of this germline dna.  rnf8 plays an essential role in signaling the presence of dna double-strand breaks.  male mice with a gene knockout for rnf8 have impaired spermatogenesis, apparently due to a defect in homologous recombinational repair.


== interactions ==
rnf8 has been shown to interact with retinoid x receptor alpha.

small intestine goblet cell,cell,"goblet cells are simple columnar goblet shaped like epithelial cells that secrete gel-forming mucins, like mucin muc5ac. the goblet cells mainly use the merocrine method of secretion, secreting vesicles into a duct, but may use apocrine methods, budding off their secretions, when under stress. the term goblet refers to the cell's goblet-like shape.  the apical portion is shaped like a cup, as it is distended by abundant mucus laden granules; its basal portion lacks these granules and is shaped like a stem.
the goblet cell is highly polarized with the nucleus and other organelles concentrated at the base of the cell and secretory granules containing mucin, at the apical surface. the apical plasma membrane projects short microvilli to give an increased surface area for secretion.goblet cells are typically found in the respiratory, reproductive and gastrointestinal tracts and are surrounded by other columnar cells. biased differentiation of airway basal cells in the respiratory epithelium, into goblet cells plays a key role in the excessive mucus production, known as mucus hypersecretion seen in many respiratory diseases, including chronic bronchitis, and asthma.

goblet cells are found scattered among the epithelial lining of organs, such as the intestinal and respiratory tracts. they are found inside the trachea, bronchi, and larger bronchioles in the respiratory tract, small intestines, the large intestine, and conjunctiva in the upper eyelid. in the conjunctiva goblet cells are a source of mucin in tears and they also secrete different types of mucins onto the ocular surface. in the lacrimal glands, mucus is synthesized by acinar cells instead.


=== microanatomy ===
goblet cells are simple columnar epithelial cells, having a height of four times that of their width. the cytoplasm of goblet cells tends to be displaced toward the basal end of the cell body by the large mucin granules, which accumulate near the apical surface of the cell along the golgi apparatus, which lies between the granules and the nucleus. this gives the basal part of the cell a basophilic staining because of nucleic acids within the nucleus and rough endoplasmic reticulum staining with hematoxylin. mucin within the granules stains pale in routine histology sections, primarily because these carbohydrate-rich proteins are washed out in the preparation of microscopy samples. however, they stain easily with the pas staining method, which colours them magenta.in mucicarmine stains, deep red mucin is found within goblet cell bodies. goblet cells can be seen in the examples below as the larger, more pale cells.

		
		
		


== function ==
the main role of goblet cells is to secrete mucus in order to protect the mucous membranes where they are found. goblet cells accomplish this by secreting mucins, large glycoproteins formed mostly by carbohydrates. the gel-like properties of mucins are given by its glycans (bound carbohydrates) attracting relatively large quantities of water. on the inner surface of the human intestine, it forms a 200 µm thick layer (less in other animals) that lubricates and protects the wall of the organ.distinct forms of mucin are produced in different organs: while muc2 is prevalent in the intestine, muc5ac and muc5b are the main forms found in the human airway. in the airway, mucus is swept by the cilia of the respiratory epithelium, in a process called mucociliary clearance, and propelled out of the lungs and into the pharynx, which results in the removal of debris and pathogens from the airway. muc5ac is overexpressed in allergic lung inflammation.mucins are continuously made and secreted by goblet cells in order to repair and replace the existing mucus layer. mucins are stored in granules inside the goblet cells before being released to the lumen of the organ. mucin secretion in the airway may occur via regulated secretion. secretion may be stimulated by irritants such as dust and smoke, especially in the airway. other stimuli are microbes such as viruses and bacteria.
anomalies in the number of goblet cells are associated with changes in the secretion of mucins, which can result in many of the abnormalities seen in asthma patients, such as clogged airways due to mucus hypersecretion, and eventual loss of lung function. overexpression of muc5ac alone does not result in the pathophysiology seen in asthma patients; it is the excessive production along with the speed of secretion that leads to the formation of thick mucus that cannot be removed by cilia or coughing action. this, in addition to airway narrowing leads to the clogging of the airways, which can be detrimental to health if not treated.  
there are other cells that secrete mucus (such as the foveolar cells of the stomach) but these are distinguished histologically from goblet cells.


=== role in oral tolerance ===
oral tolerance is the process by which the immune system is prevented from responding to antigen derived from food products, as peptides from food may pass into the bloodstream via the gut, which would in theory lead to an immune response. a paper published in nature in 2012 has shed some light on the process and implicated goblet cells as having a role in the process. it was known that cd103-expressing dendritic cells of the lamina propria had a role to play in the induction of oral tolerance (potentially by inducing the differentiation of regulatory t cells), and this paper suggests that the goblet cells act to preferentially deliver antigen to these cd103+ dendritic cells.


== clinical significance ==


=== allergic asthma ===
the excessive mucus production seen in allergic asthma patients is due to goblet cell metaplasia, the differentiation of airway epithelial cells into mucin producing goblet cells. these cells produce the thick mucins muc5ac and muc5b, which clog the airway, leading to the airflow obstruction characteristic of asthma.goblet cell metaplasia in allergic asthma is due to the action of the cytokine il-13. il-13 binds to the il-4rα receptor and initiates a stat6 signalling response. binding of il-13 causes phosphorylation of tyrosine residues at the il-4rα. this results in docking of stat6 monomers, which themselves are phosphorylated and then subsequently leave the receptor and congregate form stat6 homodimers in the cytoplasm. these homodimers then enter the nucleus, where they bind to regulatory elements in the dna, which affects the transcription of certain genes involved in mucus production.induction of stat6 signaling by il-13 leads to increased of expression of 15-lipoxygenase (15-lo-1), which is an enzyme involved in the breakdown of unsaturated fatty acids. 15-lipoxygenase acts by binding to phospholipids and yields hydroperoxy and epoxy metabolites. one such metabolite, 15-hydroxyeicosatetranoic acid (15-hete), is released intracellularly, where it conjugates to phosphatidylethanolamine, a phospholipid component. 15-hete-pe induces expression of the mucin muc5ac.


=== goblet cell carcinoids ===
goblet cell carcinoids are a class of rare tumors that form as a result of an excessive proliferation of both goblet and neuroendocrine cells. the majority of these tumors arise in the appendix and may present symptoms similar to the much more common acute appendicitis. the main treatment for localized goblet cells tumors is removal of the appendix, and sometimes removal of the right hemicolon is also performed. disseminated tumors may require treatment with chemotherapy in addition to surgery.


=== metaplasia ===

barrett's esophagus is a metaplasia of the esophagus into intestinal epithelium, characterized by the presence of goblet cells.


=== treatments ===


==== monoclonal antibodies ====
studies of mice given monoclonal antibodies for il-13 results in decreased expression of goblet cells in asthma patients. some treatments that use anti-il-13 monoclonal antibodies include tralokinumab, and lebrikizumab. these treatments have shown improvements in asthma patients, yet there are still limitations to the use of anti-il-13 monoclonal antibodies. dupilumab is a newer drug that targets the shared receptor of il-4 and il-13, il4rα. since il-4 and il-13 have interrelated biological activities, dupilumab is a more effective form of treatment as it targets both interleukins.


== history ==
the cells were first noted by henle in 1837 when studying the lining of the small intestine, seen to be mucus producing by leydig in 1857 (who was examining the epidermis of fish), and were given their name by schulze in 1867, schulze chose the descriptive name ""goblet"" because of the shape of the cell, rather than a functional name, as he remained uncertain as to the mucous-producing function of the cell.nowadays these cells are used in the laboratories to evaluate the intestinal absorption of drug targets with different kits, such as the cacogoblet.

haploid cell,cell,"ploidy () is the number of complete sets of chromosomes in a cell, and hence the number of possible alleles for autosomal and pseudoautosomal genes. somatic cells, tissues, and individual organisms can be described according to the number of sets of chromosomes present (the ""ploidy level""): monoploid (1 set), diploid (2 sets), triploid (3 sets), tetraploid (4 sets), pentaploid (5 sets), hexaploid (6 sets), heptaploid or septaploid (7 sets), etc. the generic term polyploid is often used to describe cells with three or more chromosome sets.virtually all sexually reproducing organisms are made up of somatic cells that are diploid or greater, but ploidy level may vary widely between different organisms, between different tissues within the same organism, and at different stages in an organism's life cycle. half of all known plant genera contain polyploid species, and about two-thirds of all grasses are polyploid. many animals are uniformly diploid, though polyploidy is common in invertebrates, reptiles, and amphibians. in some species, ploidy varies between individuals of the same species (as in the social insects), and in others entire tissues and organ systems may be polyploid despite the rest of the body being diploid (as in the mammalian liver). for many organisms, especially plants and fungi, changes in ploidy level between generations are major drivers of speciation. in mammals and birds, ploidy changes are typically fatal. there is, however, evidence of polyploidy in organisms now considered to be diploid, suggesting that polyploidy has contributed to evolutionary diversification in plants and animals through successive rounds of polyploidization and rediploidization.humans are diploid organisms, carrying two complete sets of chromosomes in their somatic cells: one set of 23 chromosomes from their father and one set of 23 chromosomes from their mother. the two sets combined provide a full complement of 46 chromosomes. this total number of individual chromosomes (counting all complete sets) is called the chromosome number. the number of chromosomes found in a single complete set of chromosomes is called the monoploid number (x). the haploid number (n) refers to the total number of chromosomes found in a gamete (a sperm or egg cell produced by meiosis in preparation for sexual reproduction). under normal conditions, the haploid number is exactly half the total number of chromosomes present in the organism's somatic cells. for diploid organisms, the monoploid number and haploid number are equal; in humans, both are equal to 23. when a human germ cell undergoes meiosis, the diploid 46-chromosome complement is split in half to form haploid gametes. after fusion of a male and a female gamete (each containing 1 set of 23 chromosomes) during fertilization, the resulting zygote again has the full complement of 46 chromosomes: 2 sets of 23 chromosomes.


== etymology ==
the term ploidy is a back-formation from haploidy and diploidy. ""ploid"" is a combination of ancient greek -πλόος (-plóos, “-fold”) and -ειδής (-eidḗs), from εἶδος (eîdos, ""form, likeness""). the principal meaning of the greek word ᾰ̔πλόος (haplóos) is ""single"", from ἁ- (ha-, “one, same”). διπλόος (diplóos) means ""duplex"" or ""two-fold"". diploid therefore means ""duplex-shaped"" (compare ""humanoid"", ""human-shaped"").
polish botanist eduard strasburger coined the terms haploid and diploid in 1905. some authors suggest that strasburger based the terms on august weismann's conception of the id (or germ plasm), hence haplo-id and diplo-id. the two terms were brought into the english language from german through william henry lang's 1908 translation of a 1906 textbook by strasburger and colleagues.


== types of ploidy ==


=== haploid and monoploid ===

the term haploid is used with two distinct but related definitions. in the most generic sense, haploid refers to having the number of sets of chromosomes normally found in a gamete. because two gametes necessarily combine during sexual reproduction to form a single zygote from which somatic cells are generated, healthy gametes always possess exactly half the number of sets of chromosomes found in the somatic cells, and therefore ""haploid"" in this sense refers to having exactly half the number of sets of chromosomes found in a somatic cell. by this definition, an organism whose gametic cells contain a single copy of each chromosome (one set of chromosomes) may be considered haploid while the somatic cells, containing two copies of each chromosome (two sets of chromosomes), are diploid. this scheme of diploid somatic cells and haploid gametes is widely used in the animal kingdom and is the simplest to illustrate in diagrams of genetics concepts. but this definition also allows for haploid gametes with more than one set of chromosomes. as given above, gametes are by definition haploid, regardless of the actual number of sets of chromosomes they contain. an organism whose somatic cells are tetraploid (four sets of chromosomes), for example, will produce gametes by meiosis that contain two sets of chromosomes. these gametes might still be called haploid even though they are numerically diploid.
an alternative usage defines ""haploid"" as having a single copy of each chromosome – that is, one and only one set of chromosomes. in this case, the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell is only said to be haploid if it has a single set of chromosomes, each one not being part of a pair. by extension a cell may be called haploid if its nucleus has one set of chromosomes, and an organism may be called haploid if its body cells (somatic cells) have one set of chromosomes per cell. by this definition haploid therefore would not be used to refer to the gametes produced by the tetraploid organism in the example above, since these gametes are numerically diploid. the term monoploid is often used as a less ambiguous way to describe a single set of chromosomes; by this second definition, haploid and monoploid are identical and can be used interchangeably.
gametes (sperm and ova) are haploid cells. the haploid gametes produced by most organisms combine to form a zygote with n pairs of chromosomes, i.e. 2n chromosomes in total. the chromosomes in each pair, one of which comes from the sperm and one from the egg, are said to be homologous. cells and organisms with pairs of homologous chromosomes are called diploid. for example, most animals are diploid and produce haploid gametes. during meiosis, sex cell precursors have their number of chromosomes halved by randomly ""choosing"" one member of each pair of chromosomes, resulting in haploid gametes. because homologous chromosomes usually differ genetically, gametes usually differ genetically from one another.all plants and many fungi and algae switch between a haploid and a diploid state, with one of the stages emphasized over the other. this is called alternation of generations. most fungi and algae are haploid during the principal stage of their life cycle, as are some primitive plants like mosses. more recently evolved plants, like the gymnosperms and angiosperms, spend the majority of their life cycle in the diploid stage. most animals are diploid, but male bees, wasps, and ants are haploid organisms because they develop from unfertilized, haploid eggs, while females (workers and queens) are diploid, making their system haplodiploid.
in some cases there is evidence that the n chromosomes in a haploid set have resulted from duplications of an originally smaller set of chromosomes. this ""base"" number – the number of apparently originally unique chromosomes in a haploid set – is called the monoploid number, also known as basic or cardinal number, or fundamental number. as an example, the chromosomes of common wheat are believed to be derived from three different ancestral species, each of which had 7 chromosomes in its haploid gametes. the monoploid number is thus 7 and the haploid number is 3 × 7 = 21. in general n is a multiple of x. the somatic cells in a wheat plant have six sets of 7 chromosomes: three sets from the egg and three sets from the sperm which fused to form the plant, giving a total of 42 chromosomes. as a formula, for wheat 2n = 6x = 42, so that the haploid number n is 21 and the monoploid number x is 7. the gametes of common wheat are considered to be haploid, since they contain half the genetic information of somatic cells, but they are not monoploid, as they still contain three complete sets of chromosomes (n = 3x).in the case of wheat, the origin of its haploid number of 21 chromosomes from three sets of 7 chromosomes can be demonstrated. in many other organisms, although the number of chromosomes may have originated in this way, this is no longer clear, and the monoploid number is regarded as the same as the haploid number. thus in humans, x = n = 23.


=== diploid ===
diploid cells have two homologous copies of each chromosome, usually one from the mother and one from the father. all or nearly all mammals are diploid organisms. the suspected tetraploid (possessing four-chromosome sets) plains viscacha rat (tympanoctomys barrerae) and golden viscacha rat (pipanacoctomys aureus) have been regarded as the only known exceptions (as of 2004). however, some genetic studies have rejected any polyploidism in mammals as unlikely, and suggest that amplification and dispersion of repetitive sequences best explain the large genome size of these two rodents. all normal diploid individuals have some small fraction of cells that display polyploidy. human diploid cells have 46 chromosomes (the somatic number, 2n) and human haploid gametes (egg and sperm) have 23 chromosomes (n). retroviruses that contain two copies of their rna genome in each viral particle are also said to be diploid. examples include human foamy virus, human t-lymphotropic virus, and hiv.


=== polyploidy ===

polyploidy is the state where all cells have multiple sets of chromosomes beyond the basic set, usually 3 or more. specific terms are triploid (3 sets), tetraploid (4 sets), pentaploid (5 sets), hexaploid (6 sets), heptaploid or septaploid (7 sets), octoploid (8 sets), nonaploid (9 sets), decaploid (10 sets), undecaploid (11 sets), dodecaploid (12 sets), tridecaploid (13 sets), tetradecaploid (14 sets), etc. some higher ploidies include hexadecaploid (16 sets), dotriacontaploid (32 sets), and tetrahexacontaploid (64 sets), though greek terminology may be set aside for readability in cases of higher ploidy (such as ""16-ploid""). polytene chromosomes of plants and fruit flies can be 1024-ploid. ploidy of systems such as the salivary gland, elaiosome, endosperm, and trophoblast can exceed this, up to 1048576-ploid in the silk glands of the commercial silkworm bombyx mori.the chromosome sets may be from the same species or from closely related species. in the latter case, these are known as allopolyploids (or amphidiploids, which are allopolyploids that behave as if they were normal diploids). allopolyploids are formed from the hybridization of two separate species. in plants, this probably most often occurs from the pairing of meiotically unreduced gametes, and not by diploid–diploid hybridization followed by chromosome doubling. the so-called brassica triangle is an example of allopolyploidy, where three different parent species have hybridized in all possible pair combinations to produce three new species.
polyploidy occurs commonly in plants, but rarely in animals. even in diploid organisms, many somatic cells are polyploid due to a process called endoreduplication, where duplication of the genome occurs without mitosis (cell division). the extreme in polyploidy occurs in the fern genus ophioglossum, the adder's-tongues, in which polyploidy results in chromosome counts in the hundreds, or, in at least one case, well over one thousand.
it is possible for polyploid organisms to revert to lower ploidy by haploidisation.


==== in bacteria and archaea ====
polyploidy is a characteristic of the bacterium deinococcus radiodurans  and of the archaeon halobacterium salinarum. these two species are highly resistant to ionizing radiation and desiccation, conditions that induce dna double-strand breaks. this resistance appears to be due to efficient homologous recombinational repair.


=== variable or indefinite ploidy ===
depending on growth conditions, prokaryotes such as bacteria may have a chromosome copy number of 1 to 4, and that number is commonly fractional, counting portions of the chromosome partly replicated at a given time. this is because under exponential growth conditions the cells are able to replicate their dna faster than they can divide.
in ciliates, the macronucleus is called ampliploid, because only part of the genome is amplified.


=== mixoploidy ===
mixoploidy is the case where two cell lines, one diploid and one polyploid, coexist within the same organism. though polyploidy in humans is not viable, mixoploidy has been found in live adults and children. there are two types: diploid-triploid mixoploidy, in which some cells have 46 chromosomes and some have 69, and diploid-tetraploid mixoploidy, in which some cells have 46 and some have 92 chromosomes. it is a major topic of cytology.


=== dihaploidy and polyhaploidy ===

dihaploid and polyhaploid cells are formed by haploidisation of polyploids, i.e., by halving the chromosome constitution.
dihaploids (which are diploid) are important for selective breeding of tetraploid crop plants (notably potatoes), because selection is faster with diploids than with tetraploids. tetraploids can be reconstituted from the diploids, for example by somatic fusion.
the term ""dihaploid"" was coined by bender to combine in one word the number of genome copies (diploid) and their origin (haploid). the term is well established in this original sense, but it has also been used for doubled monoploids or doubled haploids, which are homozygous and used for genetic research.


=== euploidy and aneuploidy ===
euploidy (greek eu, ""true"" or ""even"") is the state of a cell or organism having one or more than one set of the same set of chromosomes, possibly excluding the sex-determining chromosomes. for example, most human cells have 2 of each of the 23 homologous monoploid chromosomes, for a total of 46 chromosomes. a human cell with one extra set of the 23 normal chromosomes (functionally triploid) would be considered euploid. euploid karyotypes would consequentially be a multiple of the haploid number, which in humans is 23.
aneuploidy is the state where one or more individual chromosomes of a normal set are absent or present in more than their usual number of copies (excluding the absence or presence of complete sets, which is considered euploidy). unlike euploidy, aneuploid karyotypes will not be a multiple of the haploid number. in humans, examples of aneuploidy include having a single extra chromosome (as in down syndrome, where affected individuals have three copies of chromosome 21) or missing a chromosome (as in turner syndrome, where affected individuals are missing an x chromosome). aneuploid karyotypes are given names with the suffix -somy (rather than -ploidy, used for euploid karyotypes), such as trisomy and monosomy.


=== homoploid ===
homoploid means ""at the same ploidy level"", i.e. having the same number of homologous chromosomes. for example, homoploid hybridization is hybridization where the offspring have the same ploidy level as the two parental species. this contrasts with a common situation in plants where chromosome doubling accompanies or occurs soon after hybridization. similarly, homoploid speciation contrasts with polyploid speciation.


=== zygoidy and azygoidy ===
zygoidy is the state in which the chromosomes are paired and can undergo meiosis. the zygoid state of a species may be diploid or polyploid. in the azygoid state the chromosomes are unpaired. it may be the natural state of some asexual species or may occur after meiosis. in diploid organisms the azygoid state is monoploid. (see below for dihaploidy.)


== special cases ==


=== more than one nucleus per cell ===
in the strictest sense, ploidy refers to the number of sets of chromosomes in a single nucleus rather than in the cell as a whole. because in most situations there is only one nucleus per cell, it is commonplace to speak of the ploidy of a cell, but in cases in which there is more than one nucleus per cell, more specific definitions are required when ploidy is discussed. authors may at times report the total combined ploidy of all nuclei present within the cell membrane of a syncytium, though usually the ploidy of each nucleus is described individually. for example, a fungal dikaryon with two separate haploid nuclei is distinguished from a diploid cell in which the chromosomes share a nucleus and can be shuffled together.


=== ancestral ploidy levels ===
it is possible on rare occasions for ploidy to increase in the germline, which can result in polyploid offspring and ultimately polyploid species. this is an important evolutionary mechanism in both plants and animals and is known as a primary driver of speciation. as a result, it may become desirable to distinguish between the ploidy of a species or variety as it presently breeds and that of an ancestor. the number of chromosomes in the ancestral (non-homologous) set is called the monoploid number (x), and is distinct from the haploid number (n) in the organism as it now reproduces.
common wheat (triticum aestivum) is an organism in which x and n differ. each plant has a total of six sets of chromosomes (with two sets likely having been obtained from each of three different diploid species that are its distant ancestors). the somatic cells are hexaploid, 2n = 6x = 42 (where the monoploid number x = 7 and the haploid number n = 21). the gametes are haploid for their own species, but triploid, with three sets of chromosomes, by comparison to a probable evolutionary ancestor, einkorn wheat.tetraploidy (four sets of chromosomes, 2n = 4x) is common in many plant species, and also occurs in amphibians, reptiles, and insects. for example, species of xenopus (african toads) form a ploidy series, featuring diploid (x. tropicalis, 2n=20), tetraploid (x. laevis, 4n=36), octaploid (x. wittei, 8n=72), and dodecaploid (x. ruwenzoriensis, 12n=108) species.over evolutionary time scales in which chromosomal polymorphisms accumulate, these changes become less apparent by karyotype – for example, humans are generally regarded as diploid, but the 2r hypothesis has confirmed two rounds of whole genome duplication in early vertebrate ancestors.


=== haplodiploidy ===
ploidy can also vary between individuals of the same species or at different stages of the life cycle. in some insects it differs by caste. in humans, only the gametes are haploid, but in many of the social insects, including ants, bees, and termites, certain individuals develop from unfertilized eggs, making them haploid for their entire lives, even as adults. in the australian bulldog ant, myrmecia pilosula, a haplodiploid species, haploid individuals of this species have a single chromosome and diploid individuals have two chromosomes. in entamoeba, the ploidy level varies from 4n to 40n in a single population. alternation of generations occurs in most plants, with individuals ""alternating"" ploidy level between different stages of their sexual life cycle.


=== tissue-specific polyploidy ===
in large multicellular organisms, variations in ploidy level between different tissues, organs, or cell lineages are common. because the chromosome number is generally reduced only by the specialized process of meiosis, the somatic cells of the body inherit and maintain the chromosome number of the zygote by mitosis. however, in many situations somatic cells double their copy number by means of endoreduplication as an aspect of cellular differentiation. for example, the hearts of two-year-old human children contain 85% diploid and 15% tetraploid nuclei, but by 12 years of age the proportions become approximately equal, and adults examined contained 27% diploid, 71% tetraploid and 2% octaploid nuclei.


== adaptive and ecological significance of variation in ploidy ==
there is continued study and debate regarding the fitness advantages or disadvantages conferred by different ploidy levels. a study comparing the karyotypes of endangered or invasive plants with those of their relatives found that being polyploid as opposed to diploid is associated with a 14% lower risk of being endangered, and a 20% greater chance of being invasive. polyploidy may be associated with increased vigor and adaptability. some studies suggest that selection is more likely to favor diploidy in host species and haploidy in parasite species.when a germ cell with an uneven number of chromosomes undergoes meiosis, the chromosomes cannot be evenly divided between the daughter cells, resulting in aneuploid gametes. triploid organisms, for instance, are usually sterile. because of this, triploidy is commonly exploited in agriculture to produce seedless fruit such as bananas and watermelons. if the fertilization of human gametes results in three sets of chromosomes, the condition is called triploid syndrome.


== glossary of ploidy numbers ==
the common potato (solanum tuberosum) is an example of a tetraploid organism, carrying four sets of chromosomes. during sexual reproduction, each potato plant inherits two sets of 12 chromosomes from the pollen parent, and two sets of 12 chromosomes from the ovule parent. the four sets combined provide a full complement of 48 chromosomes. the haploid number (half of 48) is 24. the monoploid number equals the total chromosome number divided by the ploidy level of the somatic cells: 48 chromosomes in total divided by a ploidy level of 4 equals a monoploid number of 12. hence, the monoploid number (12) and haploid number (24) are distinct in this example.
however, commercial potato crops (as well as many other crop plants) are commonly propagated vegetatively (by asexual reproduction through mitosis), in which case new individuals are produced from a single parent, without the involvement of gametes and fertilization, and all the offspring are genetically identical to each other and to the parent, including in chromosome number. the parents of these vegetative clones may still be capable of producing haploid gametes in preparation for sexual reproduction, but these gametes are not used to create the vegetative offspring by this route.

roxithromycin,antibiotic,"roxithromycin is a semi-synthetic macrolide antibiotic. it is used to treat respiratory tract, urinary and soft tissue infections. roxithromycin is derived from erythromycin, containing the same 14-membered lactone ring. however, an n-oxime side chain is attached to the lactone ring.  it is also currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of male-pattern hair loss.it was patented in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1987. roxithromycin is available under several brandnames. roxithromycin is not available in the united states. roxithromycin is available in australia, france, germany, israel, south korea and new zealand. roxithromycin has also been tested to possess antimalarial activity.


== side effects ==
most common side effects are gastrointestinal; diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain and vomiting.  less common side effects include central or peripheral nervous system events such as headaches, dizziness, vertigo, and also the rarely seen rashes, abnormal liver function values and alteration in senses of smell and taste.


== drug interactions ==
roxithromycin has fewer interactions than erythromycin as it has a lower affinity for cytochrome p450.
roxithromycin does not interact with hormonal contraceptives, prednisolone, carbamazepine, ranitidine or antacids.
when roxithromycin is administered with theophylline, some studies have shown an increase in the plasma concentration of theophylline. a change in dosage is usually not required but patients with high levels of theophylline at the start of the treatment should have their plasma levels monitored.
roxithromycin appears to interact with warfarin. this is shown by an increase in prothrombin time and/or international normalised ratio (inr) in patients taking roxithromycin and warfarin concurrently. as a consequence, severe bleeding episodes have occurred.


== available forms ==
roxithromycin is commonly available as tablets or oral suspension.


== mechanism of action ==
roxithromycin prevents bacteria from growing, by interfering with their protein synthesis. roxithromycin binds to the subunit 50s of the bacterial ribosome, and thus inhibits the synthesis of peptides. roxithromycin has similar antimicrobial spectrum as erythromycin, but is more effective against certain gram-negative bacteria, particularly legionella pneumophila.

when taken before a meal, roxithromycin is very rapidly absorbed, and diffuses into most tissues and phagocytes. due to the high concentration in phagocytes, roxithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. during active phagocytosis, large concentrations of roxithromycin are released.


== metabolism ==
only a small portion of roxithromycin is metabolised. most of roxithromycin is secreted unchanged into the bile and some in expired air. under 10% is excreted into the urine. roxithromycin's half-life is 12 hours.


== history ==
german pharmaceutical company roussel uclaf first marketed roxithromycin in 1987.

protein rufy3,protein,"run and fyve domain containing 2 (rufy2) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the rufy2 gene. the rufy2 gene is named for two of its domains, the run domain and fyve domains. rufy2 is a member of the rufy family of proteins that include rufy1, rufy2, rufy3, and rufy4. rufy2 protein has a dynamic role in endosomal membrane trafficking.


== gene ==

the human rufy2 gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 10 at region 21 band 3, from base pair 70,100,864 to base pair 70,167,051 on the reverse strand (build grch37/hg19) (map). the gene produces a 2,080 base pair mrna. there are 18 predicted exons in the human gene  with 13 alternative transcripts.


=== gene neighborhood ===
8,180 base pairs upstream of rufy2 is the protein-coding gene for phenazine biosynthesis-like protein domain containing (pbld). while 6,770 base pairs downstream from rufy2 is a dna2 conserved helicase/nuclease involved in the maintenance of mitochondrial and nuclear dna stability.

beta-carotene,reagent,"β-carotene is an organic, strongly coloured red-orange pigment abundant in fungi, plants, and fruits. it is a member of the carotenes, which are terpenoids (isoprenoids), synthesized biochemically from eight isoprene units and thus having 40 carbons. among the carotenes, β-carotene is distinguished by having beta-rings at both ends of the molecule. β-carotene is biosynthesized from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate.in some mucoralean fungi, β-carotene is a precursor to the synthesis of trisporic acid.β-carotene is the most common form of carotene in plants. when used as a food coloring, it has the e number e160a. the structure was deduced by karrer et al. in 1930. in nature, β-carotene is a precursor (inactive form) to vitamin a via the action of beta-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase.isolation of β-carotene from fruits abundant in carotenoids is commonly done using column chromatography. it can also be extracted from the beta-carotene rich algae, dunaliella salina. the separation of β-carotene from the mixture of other carotenoids is based on the polarity of a compound. β-carotene is a non-polar compound, so it is separated with a non-polar solvent such as hexane. being highly conjugated, it is deeply colored, and as a hydrocarbon lacking functional groups, it is very lipophilic.


== provitamin a activity ==
plant carotenoids are the primary dietary source of provitamin a worldwide, with β-carotene as the best-known provitamin a carotenoid. others include α-carotene and β-cryptoxanthin. carotenoid absorption is restricted to the duodenum of the small intestine and dependent on class b scavenger receptor (sr-b1) membrane protein, which is also responsible for the absorption of vitamin e (α-tocopherol). one molecule of β-carotene can be cleaved by the intestinal enzyme β,β-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase into two molecules of vitamin a.absorption efficiency is estimated to be between 9 and 22%. the absorption and conversion of carotenoids may depend on the form of β-carotene (e.g., cooked vs. raw vegetables, or in a supplement), the intake of fats and oils at the same time, and the current stores of vitamin a and β-carotene in the body. researchers list these factors that determine the provitamin a activity of carotenoids:
species of carotene
molecular linkage
amount in the meal
matrix properties
effectors
nutrient status
genetics
host specificity
interactions between factors


=== symmetric and asymmetric cleavage ===
in the molecular chain between the two cyclohexyl rings, β-carotene cleaves either symmetrically or asymmetrically. symmetric cleavage with the enzyme β,β-carotene-15,15'-dioxygenase requires an antioxidant such as α-tocopherol. this symmetric cleavage gives two equivalent retinal molecules and each retinal molecule further reacts to give retinol (vitamin a) and retinoic acid. β-carotene is also cleaved into two asymmetric products; the product is β-apocarotenal (8',10',12'). asymmetric cleavage reduces the level of retinoic acid significantly.


=== conversion factors ===
since 2001, the us institute of medicine uses retinol activity equivalents (rae) for their dietary reference intakes, defined as follows:


==== retinol activity equivalents (raes) ====
1 µg re = 1 µg retinol
1 µg rae = 2 µg all-trans-β-carotene from supplements
1 µg rae = 12 µg of all-trans-β-carotene from food
1 µg rae = 24 µg α-carotene or β-cryptoxanthin from food
rae takes into account carotenoids' variable absorption and conversion to vitamin a by humans better than and replaces the older retinol equivalent (re) (1 µg re = 1 µg retinol, 6 µg β-carotene, or 12 µg α-carotene or β-cryptoxanthin). re was developed 1967 by the united nations/world health organization food and agriculture organization (fao/who).another older unit of vitamin a activity is the international unit (iu). like retinol equivalent, the international unit does not take into account carotenoids' variable absorption and conversion to vitamin a by humans, as well as the more modern retinol activity equivalent. unfortunately, food and supplement labels still generally use iu, but iu can be converted to the more useful retinol activity equivalent as follows:


==== international units ====
1 µg rae = 3.33 iu retinol
1 iu retinol = 0.3 μg rae
1 iu β-carotene from supplements = 0.3 μg rae
1 iu β-carotene from food = 0.05 μg rae
1 iu α-carotene or β-cryptoxanthin from food = 0.025 μg rae1


== dietary sources ==
beta-carotene is found in many foods and is sold as a dietary supplement. β-carotene contributes to the orange color of many different fruits and vegetables. vietnamese gac (momordica cochinchinensis spreng.) and crude palm oil are particularly rich sources, as are yellow and orange fruits, such as cantaloupe, mangoes, pumpkin, and papayas, and orange root vegetables such as carrots and sweet potatoes. the color of β-carotene is masked by chlorophyll in green leaf vegetables such as spinach, kale, sweet potato leaves, and sweet gourd leaves. vietnamese gac and crude palm oil have the highest content of β-carotene of any known plant sources, 10 times higher than carrots, for example. however, gac is quite rare and unknown outside its native region of southeast asia, and crude palm oil is typically processed to remove the carotenoids before sale to improve the color and clarity.the average daily intake of β-carotene is in the range 2–7 mg, as estimated from a pooled analysis of 500,000 women living in the us, canada, and some european countries.the u.s. department of agriculture lists these 10 foods to have the highest β-carotene content per serving.


== side effects ==
excess β-carotene is predominantly stored in the fat tissues of the body. the most common side effect of excessive β-carotene consumption is carotenodermia, a physically harmless condition that presents as a conspicuous orange skin tint arising from deposition of the carotenoid in the outermost layer of the epidermis. adults' fat stores are often yellow from accumulated carotenoids, including β-carotene, while infants' fat stores are white. carotenodermia is quickly reversible upon cessation of excessive intakes.


=== excessive intakes and vitamin a toxicity ===
the proportion of carotenoids absorbed decreases as dietary intake increases. within the intestinal wall (mucosa), β-carotene is partially converted into vitamin a (retinol) by an enzyme, dioxygenase. this mechanism is regulated by the individual's vitamin a status. if the body has enough vitamin a, the conversion of β-carotene decreases. therefore, β-carotene is considered a safe source of vitamin a and high intakes will not lead to hypervitaminosis a.


=== drug interactions ===
β-carotene can interact with medication used for lowering cholesterol. taking them together can lower the effectiveness of these medications and is considered only a moderate interaction. β-carotene should not be taken with orlistat, a weight-loss medication, as orlistat can reduce the absorption of β-carotene by as much as 30%. bile acid sequestrants and proton-pump inhibitors can also decrease absorption of β-carotene. consuming alcohol with β-carotene can decrease its ability to convert to retinol and could possibly result in hepatotoxicity.


=== β-carotene and lung cancer in smokers ===
chronic high doses of β-carotene supplementation increases the probability of lung cancer in smokers. the effect is specific to supplementation dose as no lung damage has been detected in those who are exposed to cigarette smoke and who ingest a physiologic dose of β-carotene (6 mg), in contrast to high pharmacologic dose (30 mg). therefore, the oncology from β-carotene is based on both cigarette smoke and high daily doses of β-carotene.increases in lung cancer may be due to the tendency of β-carotene to oxidize, and may hasten oxidation more than other food colors such as annatto. a β-carotene breakdown product suspected of causing cancer at high dose is trans-β-apo-8'-carotenal (common apocarotenal), which has been found in one study to be mutagenic and genotoxic in cell cultures which do not respond to β-carotene itself.additionally, supplemental β-carotene may increase the risk of prostate cancer, intracerebral hemorrhage, and cardiovascular and total mortality in people who smoke cigarettes or have a history of high-level exposure to asbestos.


== research ==
medical authorities generally recommend obtaining beta-carotene from food rather than dietary supplements.
research is insufficient to determine whether a minimum level of beta-carotene consumption is necessary for human health and to identify what problems might arise from insufficient beta-carotene intake, although strict vegetarians rely on pro-vitamin a carotenoids to meet their vitamin a requirements. use of beta-carotene to treat or prevent some diseases has been studied.


=== cancer ===
a 2010 systemic meta review concluded that supplementation with β-carotene does not appear to decrease the risk of cancer overall, nor specific cancers including: pancreatic, colorectal, prostate, breast, melanoma, or skin cancer generally. high levels of β-carotene may increase the risk of lung cancer in current and former smokers. this is likely because beta-carotene is unstable in cigarette smoke-exposed lungs where it forms oxidized metabolites that can induce carcinogen-bioactivating enzymes. results are not clear for thyroid cancer. in a single, small clinical study published in 1989, natural beta-carotene appeared to reduce premalignant gastric lesions.


=== cataract ===
a cochrane review looked at supplementation of β-carotene, vitamin c, and vitamin e, independently and combined, on people to examine differences in risk of cataract, cataract extraction, progression of cataract, and slowing the loss of visual acuity. these studies found no evidence of any protective effects afforded by β-carotene supplementation on preventing and slowing age-related cataract. a second meta-analysis compiled data from studies that measured diet-derived serum beta-carotene and reported a not statistically significant 10% decrease in cataract risk.


== nanotechnology ==
dispersed β-carotene molecules can be encapsulated into carbon nanotubes enhancing their optical properties. efficient energy transfer occurs between the encapsulated dye and nanotube — light is absorbed by the dye and without significant loss is transferred to the nanotube. encapsulation increases chemical and thermal stability of β-carotene molecules; it also allows their isolation and individual characterization.

natural helper lymphocyte,cell,"the t helper cells (th cells), also known as cd4+ cells or cd4-positive cells, are a type of t cell that play an important role in the immune system, particularly in the adaptive immune system. as their name suggests, they ""help"" the activity of other immune cells by releasing cytokines, small protein mediators that alter the behavior of target cells that express receptors for those cytokines. these cells help to polarize the immune response into the appropriate kind depending on the nature of the immunological insult (virus vs. extracellular bacterium vs. intracellular bacterium vs. helminth vs. fungus vs. protist). they are generally considered essential in b cell antibody class switching, breaking cross-tolerance in dendritic cells, in the activation and growth of cytotoxic t cells, and in maximizing bactericidal activity of phagocytes such as macrophages and neutrophils.
mature th cells express the surface protein cd4 and are referred to as cd4+ t cells. such cd4+ t cells are generally treated as having a pre-defined role as helper t cells within the immune system. for example, when an antigen-presenting cell displays a peptide antigen on mhc class ii proteins, a cd4+ cell will aid those cells through a combination of cell to cell interactions (e.g. cd40 (protein) and cd40l) and through cytokines.
cd154, also called cd40 ligand or cd40l, is a cell surface protein that mediates t cell helper function in a contact-dependent process and is a member of the tnf superfamily of molecules.  it binds to cd40 on antigen-presenting cells (apc), which leads to many effects depending on the target cell type. cd154 acts as a costimulatory molecule and is particularly important on a subset of t cells called t follicular helper cells (tfh cells). on tfh cells, cd154 promotes b cell maturation and function by engaging cd40 on the b cell surface and therefore facilitating cell-cell communication. a defect in this gene results in an inability to undergo immunoglobulin class switching and is associated with hyper igm syndrome. absence of cd154 also stops the formation of germinal centers and therefore prohibits antibody affinity maturation, an important process in the adaptive immune system that allows for the generation of high-affinity antibodies that protect against future challenge by pathogens.
the importance of helper t cells collectively can be seen from hiv, a virus that primarily infects cd4+ t cells (but is capable of infecting other important cells of the immune system, like macrophages that express cd4). in the advanced stages of hiv infection, loss of functional cd4+ t cells leads to the symptomatic stage of infection known as the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). when hiv is detected early in blood or other bodily fluids, proper adherence to antiretroviral therapy will prevent the progression of hiv into aids and allow the body to naturally restore its own cd4 cell count (a small proportion of individuals is able to achieve prolonged control of viral load without significant decline in t cell levels over time without the aid of antiretroviral therapy, who are termed ""elite controllers"" or ""long-term nonprogressors""). hiv is an example of a secondary immunodeficiency disorder. primary immunodeficiencies are genetic conditions which result in immunological defects that prevent adequate clearance of infections and t cell deficiencies are particularly devastating. one example is scid (severe combined immunodeficiency) which has many causes and varies in its precise phenotype depending on the cause. while most forms of scid result in absence of both t and b cell lineages, atypical scid is characterized (in part) by a normal level of b cells but profound t cell deficiency. however, because of the deficiency of helper t cells, the b cells have profoundly impaired function.it is critical to understand that viewing th cells as a monolithic immunological entity is fallacious because they are extremely diverse in terms of function and their interaction with partner cells (this is elaborated upon below). in general, mature naive t cells (those which have passed through the checkpoints of development in the thymus but have not yet encountered their cognate antigen) are stimulated by professional antigen presenting cells to acquire an effector module. these are defined by the presence of a lineage-determining (or lineage-specifying) transcription factor (also called master regulator, though the term has been criticized for being too reductive). the loss of function in a lineage specifying transcription factor results in the absence of the corresponding class of helper t cell which can be devastating for the health of the host. for example, conventional, regulatory t cells (treg cells) are defined by the expression of foxp3 (forkhead box p3) and the loss of function of this transcription factor results in a condition called ipex (immunodysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy x-linked) syndrome which is characterized by out-of-control immune responses that cause severe tissue damage as well as fulminant autoimmune disease (note that this is autoimmune disease and not merely the presence of autoreactivity) because this population of helper t cells is not present to dampen them. in some cases, a loss-of-function mutation can occur more upstream of the lineage-specifying transcription factor. for example, in hyper ige syndrome there is a mutation in the stat3 gene which is responsible for inducing the rorγt transcription factor in response to the combination of tgf-β and either il-6 or il-21 which specifies th17 cells. as a result of the absence of these cells patients have severe fungal infections and have difficulty responding to pyogenic bacterial pathogens (though they also have other immunological defects because stat3 is involved in other signaling pathways as well). stat3 deficiency also compromises the ability to generate tfh cells.


== activation of naive helper t cells ==

following t cell development in the thymus, these cells (termed recent thymic emigrants (rte)) egress from the thymus and home to secondary lymphoid organs (slo; spleen and lymph nodes). of note, only a very small minority of t cells egresses from the thymus (estimates commonly range from 1-5% but some experts feel even this is generous). maturation of rte in slo results in the generation of mature naive t cells (naïve meaning they have never been exposed to the antigen that they are programmed to respond to), but naive t cells now lack or have downregulated (reduced) expression of the rte-related surface markers, such as cd31, ptk7, complement receptor 1 and 2 (cr1, cr2) and the production of interleukin 8 (il-8). like all t cells, they express the t cell receptor-cd3 complex. the t cell receptor (tcr) consists of both constant and variable regions. the variable region determines what antigen the t cell can respond to. cd4+ t cells have tcrs with an affinity for class ii mhc, and cd4 is involved in determining mhc affinity during maturation in the thymus. class ii mhc proteins are generally only found on the surface of professional antigen-presenting cells (apcs). professional antigen-presenting cells are primarily dendritic cells, macrophages and b cells, although dendritic cells are the only cell group that expresses mhc class ii constitutively (at all times). some apcs also bind native (or unprocessed) antigens to their surface, such as follicular dendritic cells (these are not the same type of cells as the dendritic cells of the immune system but rather have a non-hematopoietic origin, and in general lack mhc class ii, meaning they are not true professional antigen-presenting cells; however, follicular dendritic cells may acquire mhc class ii proteins via exosomes that become attached to them). t cells require antigens to be processed into short fragments which form linear epitopes on mhc class ii (in the case of helper t cells because they express cd4) or mhc class i (in the case of cytotoxic t cells which express cd8). mhc class ii binding pockets are flexible with respect to the length of the peptides they hold. generally, there are 9 core amino acid residues with several flanking amino acids which form a length of about 12-16 amino acids total but have been known to hold as many as 25 amino acids. by comparison, mhc class i proteins are usually 9-10 peptides long. the activation of naive t cells is commonly explained in terms of the 3-signal model, elaborated upon below.


=== activation (signal 1) ===
during an immune response, professional antigen-presenting cells (apcs) endocytose antigens (typically bacteria or viruses), which undergo processing, then travel from the infection site to the lymph nodes. typically, the apc responsible is a dendritic cell. if the antigen expresses appropriate molecular patterns (sometimes known as signal 0), it can induce maturation of the dendritic cell which results in enhanced expression of costimulatory molecules needed to activate t cells (see signal 2) and mhc class ii. once at the lymph nodes, the apcs begin to present antigen peptides that are bound to class ii mhc, allowing cd4+ t cells that express the specific tcrs against the peptide/mhc complex to activate.
when a th cell encounters and recognizes the antigen on an apc, the tcr-cd3 complex binds strongly to the peptide-mhc complex present on the surface of professional apcs. cd4, a co-receptor of the tcr complex, also binds to a different section of the mhc molecule. it is estimated that approximately 50 of these interactions are required for the activation of a helper t cell and assemblies known as microclusters have been observed forming between the tcr-cd3-cd4 complexes of the t cell and the mhc class ii proteins of the dendritic cell at the zone of contact. when these all come together, the cd4 is able to recruit a kinase called lck which phosphorylates immunotyrosine activation motifs (itams) present on the cd3 gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta chains. the protein zap-70 can bind these phosphorylated itams via its sh2 domain and then itself becomes phosphorylated, wherein it orchestrates the downstream signaling required for t cell activation. lck activation is controlled by the opposing actions of cd45 and csk. cd45 activates lck by dephosphorylating a tyrosine in its c-terminal tail, while csk phosphorylates lck at that site. the loss of cd45 produces a form of scid because failure to activate lck prevents appropriate t cell signaling. memory t cells also make use of this pathway and have higher levels of lck expressed and the function of csk is inhibited in these cells.the binding of the antigen-mhc to the tcr complex and cd4 may also help the apc and the th cell adhere during th cell activation, but the integrin protein lfa-1 on the t cell and icam on the apc are the primary molecules of adhesion in this cell interaction.it is unknown what role the relatively bulky extracellular region of cd45 plays during cell interactions, but cd45 has various isoforms that change in size depending on the th cell's activation and maturation status. for example, cd45 shortens in length following th activation (cd45ra+ to cd45ro+), but whether this change in length influences activation is unknown. it has been proposed that the larger cd45ra may decrease the accessibility of the t cell receptor for the antigen-mhc molecule, thereby necessitating an increase in the affinity (and specificity) of the t cell for activation. however, once the activation has occurred, cd45 shortens, allowing easier interactions and activation as an effector t helper cell.


=== survival (signal 2) ===
having received the first tcr/cd3 signal, the naïve t cell must activate a second independent biochemical pathway, known as signal 2. this verification step is a protective measure to ensure that a t cell is responding to a foreign antigen. if this second signal is not present during initial antigen exposure, the t cell presumes that it is auto-reactive. this results in the cell becoming anergic (anergy is generated from the unprotected biochemical changes of signal 1). anergic cells will not respond to any antigen in the future, even if both signals are present later on. these cells are generally believed to circulate throughout the body with no value until they undergo apoptosis.the second signal involves an interaction between cd28 on the cd4+ t cell and the proteins cd80 (b7.1) or cd86 (b7.2) on the professional apcs. both cd80 and cd86 activate the cd28 receptor. these proteins are also known as co-stimulatory molecules.although the verification stage is necessary for the activation of naïve helper t cells, the importance of this stage is best demonstrated during the similar activation mechanism of cd8+ cytotoxic t cells. as naïve cd8+ t cells have no true bias towards foreign sources, these t cells must rely on the activation of cd28 for confirmation that they recognise a foreign antigen (as cd80/cd86 is only expressed by active apc's). cd28 plays an important role in decreasing the risk of t cell auto-immunity against host antigens.once the naïve t cell has both pathways activated, the biochemical changes induced by signal 1 are altered, allowing the cell to activate instead of undergoing anergy. the second signal is then obsolete; only the first signal is necessary for future activation. this is also true for memory t cells, which is one example of learned immunity. faster responses occur upon reinfection because memory t cells have already undergone confirmation and can produce effector cells much sooner.


=== differentiation (signal 3) ===
once the two-signal activation is complete the t helper cell (th) then allows itself to proliferate. it achieves this by releasing a potent t cell growth factor called interleukin 2 (il-2) which acts upon itself in an autocrine fashion. activated t cells also produce the alpha sub-unit of the il-2 receptor (cd25 or il-2r), enabling a fully functional receptor that can bind with il-2, which in turn activates the t cell's proliferation pathways.the autocrine or paracrine secretion of il-2 can bind to that same th cell or neighboring th's via the il-2r thus driving proliferation and clonal expansion. the th cells receiving both signals of activation and proliferation will then become th0 cells (t helper 0) cell that secrete il-2, il-4 and interferon gamma (ifn-γ). the th0 cells will then differentiate into th1 or th2 cells depending on cytokine environment. ifn-γ drives th1 cell production while il-10 and il-4 inhibit th1 cell production. conversely, il-4 drives th2 cell production and ifn-γ inhibits th2 cells. these cytokines are pleiotropic and carry out many other functions of the immune response.


== effector function ==
in 1991, three groups reported discovering cd154, which is the molecular basis of t cell helper function. seth lederman at columbia university generated a murine monoclonal antibody, 5c8 that inhibited contact-dependent t cell helper function in human cells which characterized the 32 kda surface protein transiently expressed on cd4+ t cells.  richard armitage at immunex cloned a cdna encoding cd154 by screening an expression library with cd40-ig.  randolph noelle at dartmouth medical school generated an antibody that bound a 39 kda protein on murine t cells and inhibited helper function.


== determination of the effector t cell response ==
helper t cells are capable of influencing a variety of immune cells, and the t cell response generated (including the extracellular signals such as cytokines) can be essential for a successful outcome from infection. in order to be effective, helper t cells must determine which cytokines will allow the immune system to be most useful or beneficial for the host. understanding exactly how helper t cells respond to immune challenges is currently of major interest in immunology, because such knowledge may be very useful in the treatment of disease and in increasing the effectiveness of vaccination.


=== th1/th2 model ===
proliferating helper t cells that develop into effector t cells differentiate into two major subtypes of cells known as th1 and th2 cells (also known as type 1 and type 2 helper t cells, respectively).
th1 helper cells lead to an increased cell-mediated response, typically against intracellular bacteria and protozoa. they are triggered by the polarising cytokine il-12 and their effector cytokines are ifn-γ and il-2. the main effector cells of th1 immunity are macrophages as well as cd8 t cells, igg b cells, and ifn-γ cd4 t cells. the key th1 transcription factors are stat4 and t-bet. ifn-γ secreted by cd4 t cells can activate macrophages to phagocytose and digest intracellular bacteria and protozoa. in addition, ifn-γ can activate inos (inducible nitric oxide synthase) to produce nitric oxide free radicals to directly kill intracellular bacteria and protozoa. th1 overactivation against autoantigens will cause  type iv or delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction.  tuberculin reaction or type 1 diabetes belong to this category of autoimmunity.th2 helper cells lead to a humoral immune response, typically against extracellular parasites such as helminths. they are triggered by the polarising cytokines il-4 and il-2, and their effector cytokines are il-4, il-5, il-9, il-10, il-13 and il-25. the main effector cells are eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells as well as b cells, and il-4/il-5 cd4 t cells. the key th2 transcription factors are stat6 and gata3. il-4 is the positive feedback cytokine for th2 cells differentiation. besides, il-4 stimulates b-cells to produce ige antibodies, which in turn stimulate mast cells to release histamine, serotonin, and leukotriene to cause broncho-constriction, intestinal peristalsis, gastric fluid acidification to expel helminths. il-5 from cd4 t cells will activate eosinophils to attack helminths. il-10 suppresses th1 cells differentiation and function of dendritic cells.  th2 overactivation against antigen will cause type i hypersensitivity which is an allergic reaction mediated by ige. allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and asthma belong to this category of overactivation .  in addition to expressing different cytokines, th2 cells also differ from th1 cells in their cell surface glycans (oligosaccharides), which makes them less susceptible to some inducers of cell death.

while we know about the types of cytokine patterns helper t cells tend to produce, we understand less about how the patterns themselves are decided. various evidence suggests that the type of apc presenting the antigen to the t cell has a major influence on its profile. other evidence suggests that the concentration of antigen presented to the t cell during primary activation influences its choice. the presence of some cytokines (such as the ones mentioned above) will also influence the response that will eventually be generated, but our understanding is nowhere near complete.


=== th17 helper cells ===

th17 helper cells are a subset of t helper cells developmentally distinct from th1 and th2 lineages producing interleukin 17 (il-17).
th cells produce il-17 which is a pro inflammatory substance. this means it is especially good at fighting extracellular pathogens and fungi.


=== thαβ helper cells ===
thαβ helper cells provide the host immunity against viruses. their differentiation is triggered by ifn α/β or il-10. their key effector cytokine is il-10. their main effector cells are nk cells as well as cd8 t cells, igg b cells, and il-10 cd4 t cells. the key thαβ transcription factors are stat1 and stat3 as well as irfs. il-10 from cd4 t cells activate nk cells' adcc to apoptose virus-infected cells and to induce host as well as viral dna fragmentation. ifn alpha/beta can suppress transcription to avoid virus replication and transmission. overactivation of thαβ against autoantigen will cause type 2 antibody-dependent cytotoxic hypersensitivity. myasthenia gravis or graves' disease belong to this category.


=== limitations to the th1/th2 model ===
the interactions between cytokines from the th1/th2 model can be more complicated in some animals. for example, the th2 cytokine il-10 inhibits cytokine production of both th subsets in humans. human il-10 (hil-10) suppresses the proliferation and cytokine production of all t cells and the activity of macrophages, but continues to stimulate plasma cells, ensuring that antibody production still occurs. as such, hil-10 is not believed to truly promote the th2 response in humans, but acts to prevent over-stimulation of helper t cells while still maximising the production of antibodies.there are also other types of t cells that can influence the expression and activation of helper t cells, such as natural regulatory t cells, along with less common cytokine profiles such as the th3 subset of helper t cells. terms such as ""regulatory"" and ""suppression"" have become ambiguous after the discovery that helper cd4+ t cells are also capable of regulating (and suppressing) their own responses outside of dedicated regulatory t cells.one major difference between regulatory t cells and effector t cells is that regulatory t cells typically serve to modulate and deactivate the immune response, while effector t cell groups usually begin with immune-promoting cytokines and then switch to inhibitory cytokines later in their life cycle. the latter is a feature of th3 cells, which transform into a regulatory subset after its initial activation and cytokine production.both regulatory t cells and th3 cells produce the cytokine transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-β) and il-10. both cytokines are inhibitory to helper t cells; tgf-β suppresses the activity of most of the immune system. there is evidence to suggest that tgf-β may not suppress activated th2 cells as effectively as it might suppress naive cells, but it is not typically considered a th2 cytokine.the characterisation of another novel t helper subtype, t helper 17 cells (th17) has cast further doubt on the basic th1/th2 model. these il-17 producing cells were initially described as a pathogenic population implicated in autoimmunity but are now thought to have their own distinct effector and regulatory functions. of note, recent evidence suggest that functional plasticity is an intrinsic capacity of t helper cells. indeed, a study in mice demonstrated that th17 cells transform into th1 cells in vivo. a subsequent study furthermore showed that extensive t helper cell plasticity is also prominent in man.many of the cytokines in this article are also expressed by other immune cells (see individual cytokines for details), and it is becoming clear that while the original th1/th2 model is enlightening and gives insight into the functions of helper t cells, it is far too simple to define its entire role or actions. some immunologists question the model completely, as some in vivo studies suggest that individual helper t cells usually do not match the specific cytokine profiles of the th model, and many cells express cytokines from both profiles. that said, the th model has still played an important part in developing our understanding of the roles and behaviour of helper t cells and the cytokines they produce during an immune response.
recent scientific studies by stockinger et al. revealed that another t helper subset may exist. th9 cells are claimed to be an il9 (interleukin 9)–producing t cell subset focused on defending helminth infections.


== memory t cell ==

historically, memory t cells were thought to belong to either the effector or central memory subtypes, each with their own distinguishing set of cell surface markers. central memory t cells reside in the lymph nodes while effector memory t cells lack the c-c chemokine receptor type 7 (ccr7) and l-selectin (cd62l) receptors, which prevents them from trafficking to the lymph nodes.
additional populations of memory t cells are now known to exist.  these include tissue-resident memory t (trm) cells and virtual memory t cells.  the single unifying theme for all memory t cell subtypes is that they are long-lived and can expand quickly to large numbers of effector t cells upon encountering their cognate antigen. by this mechanism they provide the immune system with ""memory"" against previously encountered pathogens.


== role in disease ==
considering the diverse and important role helper t cells play in the immune system, it is not surprising that these cells often influence the immune response against disease. they also appear to make occasional mistakes, or generate responses that would be politely considered non-beneficial. in the worst-case scenario, the helper t cell response could lead to a disaster and the death of the host. fortunately this is a very rare occurrence.


=== antitumor immunity ===


=== hypersensitivity ===
the immune system must achieve a balance of sensitivity in order to respond to foreign antigens without responding to the antigens of the host itself. when the immune system responds to very low levels of antigen that it usually shouldn't respond to, a hypersensitivity response occurs. hypersensitivity is believed to be the cause of allergy and some auto-immune disease.
hypersensitivity reactions can be divided into four types:

type 1 hypersensitivity includes common immune disorders such as asthma, allergic rhinitis (hay fever), eczema, urticaria (hives) and anaphylaxis. these reactions all involve ige antibodies, which require a th2 response during helper t cell development. preventive treatments, such as corticosteroids and montelukast, focus on suppressing mast cells or other allergic cells; t cells do not play a primary role during the actual inflammatory response. it's important to note that the numeral allocation of hypersensitivity ""types"" does not correlate (and is completely unrelated) to the ""response"" in the th model.
type 2 and type 3 hypersensitivity both involve complications from auto-immune or low affinity antibodies. in both of these reactions, t cells may play an accomplice role in generating these auto-specific antibodies, although some of these reactions under type 2 hypersensitivity would be considered normal in a healthy immune system (for example, rhesus factor reactions during child-birth is a normal immune response against child antigens). the understanding of the role of helper t cells in these responses is limited but it is generally thought that th2 cytokines would promote such disorders. for example, studies have suggested that lupus (sle) and other auto-immune diseases of similar nature can be linked to the production of th2 cytokines.
type 4 hypersensitivity, also known as delayed type hypersensitivity, are caused via the over-stimulation of immune cells, commonly lymphocytes and macrophages, resulting in chronic inflammation and cytokine release. antibodies do not play a direct role in this allergy type. t cells play an important role in this hypersensitivity, as they activate against the stimulus itself and promote the activation of other cells; particularly macrophages via th1 cytokines.other cellular hypersensitivities include cytotoxic t cell mediated auto-immune disease, and a similar phenomenon; transplant rejection. helper t cells are required to fuel the development of these diseases. in order to create sufficient auto-reactive killer t cells, interleukin-2 must be produced, and this is supplied by cd4+ t cells. cd4+ t cells can also stimulate cells such as natural killer cells and macrophages via cytokines such as interferon-gamma, encouraging these cytotoxic cells to kill host cells in certain circumstances.
the mechanism that killer t cells use during auto-immunity is almost identical to their response against viruses, and some viruses have been accused of causing auto-immune diseases such as type 1 diabetes mellitus. cellular auto-immune disease occurs because the host antigen recognition systems fail, and the immune system believes, by mistake, that a host antigen is foreign. as a result, the cd8+ t cells treat the host cell presenting that antigen as infected, and go on to destroy all host cells (or in the case of transplant rejection, transplant organ) that express that antigen.
some of this section is a simplification. many auto-immune diseases are more complex. a well-known example is rheumatoid arthritis, where both antibodies and immune cells are known to play a role in the pathology. generally the immunology of most auto-immune diseases is not well understood.


=== hiv infection ===
perhaps the best example of the importance of cd4+ t cells is demonstrated with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection. hiv mainly targets lymphoid cd4+ t cells, but can infect other cells that express cd4 such as macrophages and dendritic cells (both groups express cd4 at low levels).
it has been proposed that during the non-symptomatic phase of hiv infection, the virus has a relatively low affinity towards t cells (and has a higher affinity for macrophages), resulting in a slow kill rate of cd4+ t cells by the immune system. this is initially compensated for via the production of new helper t cells from the thymus (originally from the bone marrow). once the virus becomes lymphotropic (or t-tropic) however, it begins to infect cd4+ t cells far more efficiently (likely due to a change in the co-receptors it binds to during infection), and the immune system is overwhelmed. of note, recent studies suggest that only ~5% of the lymphoid-derived cd4 t cells targeted by hiv are permissive and become productively infected with the virus. more than 95% of the cd4 t cells that die are resting and are unable to support productive infection. these cells undergo abortive infection with hiv. cell death is triggered when the host cell detects hiv foreign dna intermediates and initiates a suicidal death pathway in an attempt to protect the host, leading to caspase-1 activation in inflammasomes, thus causing pyroptosis (a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death).at this point chronic inflammation ensues, and functional cd4+ t cell levels begin to decrease, eventually to a point where the cd4+ t cell population is too small to recognize the full range of antigens that could potentially be detected. the depletion of cd4 t cells and the development of chronic inflammation are signature processes in hiv pathogenesis that propel progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids). cd4 t cell depleted to the cell count of less than 200cell/μl in blood during aids allows various pathogens to escape t cell recognition, thus allowing opportunistic infections that would normally elicit a helper t cell response to bypass the immune system. while these complete bypass situations only occur when the helper t cell response is absolutely necessary for infection clearance, most infections increase in severity and/or duration because the immune system's helper t cells provide less efficient immune response.
two components of the immune system are particularly affected in aids, due to its cd4+ t cell dependency:

cd8+ t cells are not stimulated as effectively during the aids stage of hiv infection, making aids patients very susceptible to most viruses, including hiv itself. this decline in killing of cd4+ t cells results in the virus being produced for a longer period (the infected cd4+ t cells are not killed as quickly), increasing the proliferation of the virus, and accelerating the development of the disease.
antibody class switching declines significantly once helper t cell function fails. the immune system loses its ability to improve the affinity of their antibodies, and are unable to generate b cells that can produce antibody groups such as igg and iga. these effects are primarily due to the loss of any helper t cell that can interact with the b lymphocyte correctly. another symptom of aids is the reduction in antibody levels due to a decrease in th2 cytokines (and less interactions by helper t cells). all of these complications result in an increased susceptibility to aggressive bacterial infections, especially in areas of the body not accessible by igm antibodies.if the patient does not respond to (or does not receive) hiv treatment they will succumb usually to either cancers or infections; the immune system finally reaches a point where it is no longer coordinated or stimulated enough to deal with the disease.
inhibition of cd4 t-cell expansion during hiv infection may occur due to microbial translocation in an il-10-dependent way. triggering pd-1 expressed on activated monocytes by its ligand pd-l1, induces il-10 production which inhibits cd4 t-cell function.


=== covid-19 ===
in coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) b cell, natural killer cell, and total lymphocyte counts decline, but both cd4+ and cd8+ cells decline to a far greater extent. low cd4+ predicted greater likelihood of intensive care unit admission, and cd4+ cell count was the only parameter that predicted length of time for viral rna clearance. despite the reduced levels of cd4+, covid-19 patients with severe disease had higher levels of th1 cd4+ cells than patients with moderate disease.

fibroblast of the conjunctiva,cell,"a pinguecula is a common type of conjunctival stromal degeneration in the eye. it appear as an elevated yellow-white plaque in the bulbar conjunctiva near to limbus. calcification may also seen occasionally.


== etiology ==
the exact etiology is unknown, but it may be associated with aging and excessive exposure to uv light.


== signs and symptoms ==
it is seen as a yellow-white deposit on the conjunctiva adjacent to the limbus (the junction between the cornea and sclera). (it is to be distinguished clinically from a pterygium, which is a wedge shaped area of fibrosis that may grow onto the cornea.) a pinguecula usually does not cause any symptoms. it is most common in tropical climates and there is a direct correlation with uv exposure.
histologically, there is degeneration of the collagen fibers of the conjunctival stroma with thinning of the overlying epithelium and occasionally calcification. actinic exposure of the thin conjunctival tissue is thought to cause fibroblasts to produce more elastin fibers, which are more twisted than normal elastin fibers and may lead to the degradation of the collagen fibers. alternatively, it has been postulated that the sub-epithelial collagen fibers undergo degradation and assume the qualities of elastic tissue while fragmenting and twisting in a different configuration from their normal state.it is thought that the high reflectivity of the solid white scleral tissue underlying the conjunctival tissue may result in additional uv exposure to the back side of the tissue. the side of the nose also reflects sunlight on to the conjunctiva. as a result, pingueculae tend to occur more often on the nasal side of the eye.  while most pingueculae are found in people over the age of 40, they are not uncommon in 20- and 30-year-old adults who spend significant time in the sun.
the surface of the conjunctival tissue overlying a pinguecula interferes with the normal spreading of the tear film. the tear ferning test reveals abnormalities of the mucous component of the tear film, making it useful as a predictor of a person's tolerance of hydrophilic soft contact lenses. contact lens intolerance can also result from the elevation of the peripheral edge of the contact lens if it overlies a pinguecula.
the plural form of pinguecula is pingueculae. pinguecula is derived from the latin word ""pinguis"" for fat or grease.


=== associated conditions ===
a pinguecula is one of the differential diagnoses for a limbal nodule. it may have an increased prevalence in gaucher's disease.


== diagnosis ==
diagnosis of pinguecula is usually done by an eye care professional during routine eye examination using slit lamp. conjunctival biopsy may be advised if malignancy is suspected.


== treatment ==
pingueculae may enlarge slowly over time, but are a benign condition, usually requiring no treatment. artificial tears may help to relieve discomfort, if it occurs. if cosmesis is a concern, or if there is discomfort in contact lens use, surgical excision may be done. occasionally, a pinguecula may become inflamed, a condition called pingueculitis. the cause of pingueculitis is unknown and there are no known infectious agents associated with it. if an inflamed pinguecula is causing discomfort or cosmetic concerns, it may be treated with short course of topical steroid. laser photocoagulation may also be used to remove pinguecula.

cytochrome b5 isoform b (arabidopsis thaliana),protein,"chloroplasts have their own dna, often abbreviated as  cpdna. it is also known as the  plastome when referring to genomes of other plastids. its existence was first proven in 1962.  the first complete chloroplast genome sequences were published in 1986, nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) by sugiura and colleagues and marchantia polymorpha (liverwort) by ozeki et al. since then, hundreds of chloroplast dnas from various species have been sequenced, but they are mostly those of land plants and green algae—glaucophytes, red algae, and other algae groups are extremely underrepresented, potentially introducing some bias in views of ""typical"" chloroplast dna structure and content.


== molecular structure ==

chloroplast dnas are circular, and are typically 120,000–170,000 base pairs long. they can have a contour length of around 30–60 micrometers, and have a mass of about 80–130 million daltons.most chloroplasts have their entire chloroplast genome combined into a single large ring, though those of dinophyte algae are a notable exception—their genome is broken up into about forty small plasmids, each 2,000–10,000 base pairs long. each minicircle contains one to three genes, but blank plasmids, with no coding dna, have also been found.


=== inverted repeats ===
many chloroplast dnas contain two inverted repeats, which separate a long single copy section (lsc) from a short single copy section (ssc).the inverted repeats vary wildly in length, ranging from 4,000 to 25,000 base pairs long each. inverted repeats in plants tend to be at the upper end of this range, each being 20,000–25,000 base pairs long.
the inverted repeat regions usually contain three ribosomal rna and two trna genes, but they can be expanded or reduced to contain as few as four or as many as over 150 genes.
while a given pair of inverted repeats are rarely completely identical, they are always very similar to each other, apparently resulting from concerted evolution.the inverted repeat regions are highly conserved among land plants, and accumulate few mutations. similar inverted repeats exist in the genomes of cyanobacteria and the other two chloroplast lineages (glaucophyta and rhodophyceæ), suggesting that they predate the chloroplast, though some chloroplast dnas like those of peas and a few red algae have since lost the inverted repeats. others, like the red alga porphyra flipped one of its inverted repeats (making them direct repeats). it is possible that the inverted repeats help stabilize the rest of the chloroplast genome, as chloroplast dnas which have lost some of the inverted repeat segments tend to get rearranged more.


=== linear structure ===
chloroplast dna has long been thought to have a circular structure, but some evidence suggests that chloroplast dna more commonly takes a linear shape. over 95% of the chloroplast dna in corn chloroplasts has been observed to be in branched linear form rather than individual circles.


=== nucleoids ===
each chloroplast contains around 100 copies of its dna in young leaves, declining to 15–20 copies in older leaves. they are usually packed into nucleoids which can contain several identical chloroplast dna rings. many nucleoids can be found in each chloroplast.though chloroplast dna is not associated with true histones, in red algae, a histone-like chloroplast protein (hc) coded by the chloroplast dna that tightly packs each chloroplast dna ring into a nucleoid has been found.in primitive red algae, the chloroplast dna nucleoids are clustered in the center of a chloroplast, while in green plants and green algae, the nucleoids are dispersed throughout the stroma.


== dna replication ==


=== leading model of cpdna replication ===

the mechanism for chloroplast dna (cpdna) replication has not been conclusively determined, but two main models have been proposed. scientists have attempted to observe chloroplast replication via electron microscopy since the 1970s. the results of the microscopy experiments led to the idea that chloroplast dna replicates using a double displacement loop (d-loop). as the d-loop moves through the circular dna, it adopts a theta intermediary form, also known as a cairns replication intermediate, and completes replication with a rolling circle mechanism. replication starts at specific points of origin. multiple replication forks open up, allowing replication machinery to replicate the dna. as replication continues, the forks grow and eventually converge. the new cpdna structures separate, creating daughter cpdna chromosomes.
in addition to the early microscopy experiments, this model is also supported by the amounts of deamination seen in cpdna. deamination occurs when an amino group is lost and is a mutation that often results in base changes. when adenine is deaminated, it becomes hypoxanthine. hypoxanthine can bind to cytosine, and when the xc base pair is replicated, it becomes a gc (thus, an a → g base change).

in cpdna, there are several a → g deamination gradients. dna becomes susceptible to deamination events when it is single stranded. when replication forks form, the strand not being copied is single stranded, and thus at risk for a → g deamination. therefore, gradients in deamination indicate that replication forks were most likely present and the direction that they initially opened (the highest gradient is most likely nearest the start site because it was single stranded for the longest amount of time). this mechanism is still the leading theory today; however, a second theory suggests that most cpdna is actually linear and replicates through homologous recombination. it further contends that only a minority of the genetic material is kept in circular chromosomes while the rest is in branched, linear, or other complex structures.


=== alternative model of replication ===
one of the main competing models for cpdna asserts that most cpdna is linear and participates in homologous recombination and replication structures similar to bacteriophage t4. it has been established that some plants have linear cpdna, such as maize, and that more still contain complex structures that scientists do not yet understand; however, the predominant view today is that most cpdna is circular. when the original experiments on cpdna were performed, scientists did notice linear structures; however, they attributed these linear forms to broken circles. if the branched and complex structures seen in cpdna experiments are real and not artifacts of concatenated circular dna or broken circles, then a d-loop mechanism of replication is insufficient to explain how those structures would replicate. at the same time, homologous recombination does not explain the multiple a → g gradients seen in plastomes. this shortcoming is one of the biggest for the linear structure theory.


== gene content and protein synthesis ==
the chloroplast genome most commonly includes around 100 genes which code for a variety of things, mostly to do with the protein pipeline and photosynthesis. as in prokaryotes, genes in chloroplast dna are organized into operons. introns are common in chloroplast dna molecules, while they are rare in prokaryotic dna molecules (plant mitochondrial dnas commonly have introns, but not human mtdna).among land plants, the contents of the chloroplast genome are fairly similar—they code for four ribosomal rnas, 30–31 trnas, 21 ribosomal proteins, and 4 rna polymerase subunits, involved in protein synthesis. for photosynthesis, the chloroplast dna includes genes for 28 thylakoid proteins and the large rubisco subunit. in addition, its genes encode eleven subunits of a protein complex which mediates redox reactions to recycle electrons, which is similar to the nadh dehydrogenase found in mitochondria.


=== chloroplast genome reduction and gene transfer ===
over time, many parts of the chloroplast genome were transferred to the nuclear genome of the host, a process called endosymbiotic gene transfer.
as a result, the chloroplast genome is heavily reduced compared to that of free-living cyanobacteria. chloroplasts may contain 60–100 genes whereas cyanobacteria often have more than 1500 genes in their genome. contrarily, there are only a few known instances where genes have been transferred to the chloroplast from various donors, including bacteria.endosymbiotic gene transfer is how we know about the lost chloroplasts in many chromalveolate lineages. even if a chloroplast is eventually lost, the genes it donated to the former host's nucleus persist, providing evidence for the lost chloroplast's existence. for example, while diatoms (a heterokontophyte) now have a red algal derived chloroplast, the presence of many green algal genes in the diatom nucleus provide evidence that the diatom ancestor (probably the ancestor of all chromalveolates too) had a green algal derived chloroplast at some point, which was subsequently replaced by the red chloroplast.in land plants, some 11–14% of the dna in their nuclei can be traced back to the chloroplast, up to 18% in arabidopsis, corresponding to about 4,500 protein-coding genes. there have been a few recent transfers of genes from the chloroplast dna to the nuclear genome in land plants.


=== proteins encoded by the chloroplast ===
of the approximately three-thousand proteins found in chloroplasts, some 95% of them are encoded by nuclear genes. many of the chloroplast's protein complexes consist of subunits from both the chloroplast genome and the host's nuclear genome. as a result, protein synthesis must be coordinated between the chloroplast and the nucleus. the chloroplast is mostly under nuclear control, though chloroplasts can also give out signals regulating gene expression in the nucleus, called retrograde signaling.


=== protein synthesis ===

protein synthesis within chloroplasts relies on an rna polymerase coded by the chloroplast's own genome, which is related to rna polymerases found in bacteria. chloroplasts also contain a mysterious second rna polymerase that is encoded by the plant's nuclear genome. the two rna polymerases may recognize and bind to different kinds of promoters within the chloroplast genome. the ribosomes in chloroplasts are similar to bacterial ribosomes.


=== rna editing in plastids ===
rna editing is the insertion, deletion, and substitution of nucleotides in a mrna transcript prior to translation to protein. the highly oxidative environment inside chloroplasts increases the rate of mutation so post-transcription repairs are needed to conserve functional sequences. the chloroplast editosome substitutes c -> u and u -> c at very specific locations on the transcript. this can change the codon for an amino acid or restore a non-functional pseudogene by adding an aug start codon or removing a premature uaa stop codon.the editosome recognizes and binds to cis sequence upstream of the editing site. the distance between the binding site and editing site  varies by gene and proteins involved in the editosome.  hundreds of different ppr proteins from the nuclear genome are involved in the rna editing process. these proteins consist of 35-mer repeated amino acids, the sequence of which determines the cis binding site for the edited transcript.basal land plants such as liverworts, mosses and ferns have hundreds of different editing sites while flowering plants typically have between thirty and forty. parasitic plants such as epifagus virginiana show a loss of rna editing resulting in a loss of function for photosynthesis genes.


== protein targeting and import ==

the movement of so many chloroplast genes to the nucleus means that many chloroplast proteins that were supposed to be translated in the chloroplast are now synthesized in the cytoplasm. this means that these proteins must be directed back to the chloroplast, and imported through at least two chloroplast membranes.curiously, around half of the protein products of transferred genes aren't even targeted back to the chloroplast. many became exaptations, taking on new functions like participating in cell division, protein routing, and even disease resistance. a few chloroplast genes found new homes in the mitochondrial genome—most became nonfunctional pseudogenes, though a few trna genes still work in the mitochondrion. some transferred chloroplast dna protein products get directed to the secretory pathway (though many secondary plastids are bounded by an outermost membrane derived from the host's cell membrane, and therefore topologically outside of the cell, because to reach the chloroplast from the cytosol, you have to cross the cell membrane, just like if you were headed for the extracellular space. in those cases, chloroplast-targeted proteins do initially travel along the secretory pathway).because the cell acquiring a chloroplast already had mitochondria (and peroxisomes, and a cell membrane for secretion), the new chloroplast host had to develop a unique protein targeting system to avoid having chloroplast proteins being sent to the wrong organelle.


=== cytoplasmic translation and n-terminal transit sequences ===

polypeptides, the precursors of proteins, are chains of amino acids. the two ends of a polypeptide are called the n-terminus, or amino end, and the c-terminus, or carboxyl end. for many (but not all) chloroplast proteins encoded by nuclear genes, cleavable transit peptides are added to the n-termini of the polypeptides, which are used to help direct the polypeptide to the chloroplast for import (n-terminal transit peptides are also used to direct polypeptides to plant mitochondria).
n-terminal transit sequences are also called presequences because they are located at the ""front"" end of a polypeptide—ribosomes synthesize polypeptides from the n-terminus to the c-terminus.chloroplast transit peptides exhibit huge variation in length and amino acid sequence. they can be from 20–150 amino acids long—an unusually long length, suggesting that transit peptides are actually collections of domains with different functions. transit peptides tend to be positively charged, rich in hydroxylated amino acids such as serine, threonine, and proline, and poor in acidic amino acids like aspartic acid and glutamic acid. in an aqueous solution, the transit sequence forms a random coil.not all chloroplast proteins include a n-terminal cleavable transit peptide though. some include the transit sequence within the functional part of the protein itself. a few have their transit sequence appended to their c-terminus instead. most of the polypeptides that lack n-terminal targeting sequences are the ones that are sent to the outer chloroplast membrane, plus at least one sent to the inner chloroplast membrane.


=== phosphorylation, chaperones, and transport ===
after a chloroplast polypeptide is synthesized on a ribosome in the cytosol, atp energy can be used to phosphorylate, or add a phosphate group to many (but not all) of them in their transit sequences. serine and threonine (both very common in chloroplast transit sequences—making up 20–30% of the sequence) are often the amino acids that accept the phosphate group. the enzyme that carries out the phosphorylation is specific for chloroplast polypeptides, and ignores ones meant for mitochondria or peroxisomes.phosphorylation changes the polypeptide's shape, making it easier for 14-3-3 proteins to attach to the polypeptide. in plants, 14-3-3 proteins only bind to chloroplast preproteins. it is also bound by the heat shock protein hsp70 that keeps the polypeptide from folding prematurely. this is important because it prevents chloroplast proteins from assuming their active form and carrying out their chloroplast functions in the wrong place—the cytosol. at the same time, they have to keep just enough shape so that they can be recognized and imported into the chloroplast.the heat shock protein and the 14-3-3 proteins together form a cytosolic guidance complex that makes it easier for the chloroplast polypeptide to get imported into the chloroplast.alternatively, if a chloroplast preprotein's transit peptide is not phosphorylated, a chloroplast preprotein can still attach to a heat shock protein or toc159. these complexes can bind to the toc complex on the outer chloroplast membrane using gtp energy.


=== the translocon on the outer chloroplast membrane (toc) ===
the toc complex, or translocon on the outer chloroplast membrane, is a collection of proteins that imports preproteins across the outer chloroplast envelope. five subunits of the toc complex have been identified—two gtp-binding proteins toc34 and toc159, the protein import tunnel toc75, plus the proteins toc64 and toc12.the first three proteins form a core complex that consists of one toc159, four to five toc34s, and four toc75s that form four holes in a disk 13 nanometers across. the whole core complex weighs about 500 kilodaltons. the other two proteins, toc64 and toc12, are associated with the core complex but are not part of it.


==== toc34 and 33 ====

toc34 is an integral protein in the outer chloroplast membrane that's anchored into it by its hydrophobic c-terminal tail. most of the protein, however, including its large guanosine triphosphate (gtp)-binding domain projects out into the stroma.toc34's job is to catch some chloroplast preproteins in the cytosol and hand them off to the rest of the toc complex. when gtp, an energy molecule similar to atp attaches to toc34, the protein becomes much more able to bind to many chloroplast preproteins in the cytosol. the chloroplast preprotein's presence causes toc34 to break gtp into guanosine diphosphate (gdp) and inorganic phosphate. this loss of gtp makes the toc34 protein release the chloroplast preprotein, handing it off to the next toc protein. toc34 then releases the depleted gdp molecule, probably with the help of an unknown gdp exchange factor. a domain of toc159 might be the exchange factor that carry out the gdp removal. the toc34 protein can then take up another molecule of gtp and begin the cycle again.toc34 can be turned off through phosphorylation. a protein kinase drifting around on the outer chloroplast membrane can use atp to add a phosphate group to the toc34 protein, preventing it from being able to receive another gtp molecule, inhibiting the protein's activity. this might provide a way to regulate protein import into chloroplasts.arabidopsis thaliana has two homologous proteins, attoc33 and attoc34 (the at stands for arabidopsis thaliana), which are each about 60% identical in amino acid sequence to toc34 in peas (called pstoc34). attoc33 is the most common in arabidopsis, and it is the functional analogue of toc34 because it can be turned off by phosphorylation. attoc34 on the other hand cannot be phosphorylated.


==== toc159 ====
toc159 is another gtp binding toc subunit, like toc34. toc159 has three domains. at the n-terminal end is the a-domain, which is rich in acidic amino acids and takes up about half the protein length. the a-domain is often cleaved off, leaving an 86 kilodalton fragment called toc86. in the middle is its gtp binding domain, which is very similar to the homologous gtp-binding domain in toc34. at the c-terminal end is the hydrophilic m-domain, which anchors the protein to the outer chloroplast membrane.toc159 probably works a lot like toc34, recognizing proteins in the cytosol using gtp. it can be regulated through phosphorylation, but by a different protein kinase than the one that phosphorylates toc34. its m-domain forms part of the tunnel that chloroplast preproteins travel through, and seems to provide the force that pushes preproteins through, using the energy from gtp.toc159 is not always found as part of the toc complex—it has also been found dissolved in the cytosol. this suggests that it might act as a shuttle that finds chloroplast preproteins in the cytosol and carries them back to the toc complex. there isn't a lot of direct evidence for this behavior though.a family of toc159 proteins, toc159, toc132, toc120, and toc90 have been found in arabidopsis thaliana. they vary in the length of their a-domains, which is completely gone in toc90. toc132, toc120, and toc90 seem to have specialized functions in importing stuff like nonphotosynthetic preproteins, and can't replace toc159.


==== toc75 ====

toc75 is the most abundant protein on the outer chloroplast envelope. it is a transmembrane tube that forms most of the toc pore itself. toc75 is a β-barrel channel lined by 16 β-pleated sheets. the hole it forms is about 2.5 nanometers wide at the ends, and shrinks to about 1.4–1.6 nanometers in diameter at its narrowest point—wide enough to allow partially folded chloroplast preproteins to pass through.toc75 can also bind to chloroplast preproteins, but is a lot worse at this than toc34 or toc159.arabidopsis thaliana has multiple isoforms of toc75 that are named by the chromosomal positions of the genes that code for them. attoc75 iii is the most abundant of these.


=== the translocon on the inner chloroplast membrane (tic) ===
the tic translocon, or translocon on the inner chloroplast membrane translocon is another protein complex that imports proteins across the inner chloroplast envelope. chloroplast polypeptide chains probably often travel through the two complexes at the same time, but the tic complex can also retrieve preproteins lost in the intermembrane space.like the toc translocon, the tic translocon has a large core complex surrounded by some loosely associated peripheral proteins like tic110, tic40, and tic21.
the core complex weighs about one million daltons and contains tic214, tic100, tic56, and tic20 i, possibly three of each.


==== tic20 ====
tic20 is an integral protein thought to have four transmembrane α-helices. it is found in the 1 million dalton tic complex. because it is similar to bacterial amino acid transporters and the mitochondrial import protein tim17 (translocase on the inner mitochondrial membrane), it has been proposed to be part of the tic import channel. there is no in vitro evidence for this though. in arabidopsis thaliana, it is known that for about every five toc75 proteins in the outer chloroplast membrane, there are two tic20 i proteins (the main form of tic20 in arabidopsis) in the inner chloroplast membrane.unlike tic214, tic100, or tic56, tic20 has homologous relatives in cyanobacteria and nearly all chloroplast lineages, suggesting it evolved before the first chloroplast endosymbiosis. tic214, tic100, and tic56 are unique to chloroplastidan chloroplasts, suggesting that they evolved later.


==== tic214 ====
tic214 is another tic core complex protein, named because it weighs just under 214 kilodaltons. it is 1786 amino acids long and is thought to have six transmembrane domains on its n-terminal end. tic214 is notable for being coded for by chloroplast dna, more specifically the first open reading frame ycf1. tic214 and tic20 together probably make up the part of the one million dalton tic complex that spans the entire membrane. tic20 is buried inside the complex while tic214 is exposed on both sides of the inner chloroplast membrane.


==== tic100 ====
tic100 is a nuclear encoded protein that's 871 amino acids long. the 871 amino acids collectively weigh slightly less than 100 thousand daltons, and since the mature protein probably doesn't lose any amino acids when itself imported into the chloroplast (it has no cleavable transit peptide), it was named tic100. tic100 is found at the edges of the 1 million dalton complex on the side that faces the chloroplast intermembrane space.


==== tic56 ====
tic56 is also a nuclear encoded protein. the preprotein its gene encodes is 527 amino acids long, weighing close to 62 thousand daltons; the mature form probably undergoes processing that trims it down to something that weighs 56 thousand daltons when it gets imported into the chloroplast. tic56 is largely embedded inside the 1 million dalton complex.tic56 and tic100 are highly conserved among land plants, but they don't resemble any protein whose function is known. neither has any transmembrane domains.

hgf,protein,"hepatocyte growth factor (hgf) or scatter factor (sf) is a paracrine cellular growth, motility and morphogenic factor. it is secreted by mesenchymal cells and targets and acts primarily upon epithelial cells and endothelial cells, but also acts on haemopoietic progenitor cells and t cells. it has been shown to have a major role in embryonic organ development, specifically in myogenesis, in adult organ regeneration, and in wound healing.


== function ==
hepatocyte growth factor regulates cell growth, cell motility, and morphogenesis by activating a tyrosine kinase signaling cascade after binding to the proto-oncogenic c-met receptor. hepatocyte growth factor is secreted by mesenchymal cells and acts as a multi-functional cytokine on cells of mainly epithelial origin. its ability to stimulate mitogenesis, cell motility, and matrix invasion gives it a central role in angiogenesis, tumorogenesis, and tissue regeneration.


== structure ==
it is secreted as a single inactive polypeptide and is cleaved by serine proteases into a 69-kda alpha-chain and 34-kda beta-chain. a disulfide bond between the alpha and beta chains produces the active, heterodimeric molecule. the protein belongs to the plasminogen subfamily of s1 peptidases but has no detectable protease activity.


== clinical significance ==
human hgf plasmid dna therapy of cardiomyocytes is being examined as a potential treatment for coronary artery disease as well as treatment for the damage that occurs to the heart after myocardial infarction.
as well as the well-characterised effects of hgf on epithelial cells, endothelial cells and haemopoietic progenitor cells, hgf also regulates the chemotaxis of t cells into heart tissue. binding of hgf by c-met, expressed on t cells, causes the upregulation of c-met, cxcr3, and ccr4 which in turn imbues them with the ability to migrate into heart tissue. hgf also promotes angiogenesis in ischemia injury. 
hgf may further play a role as an indicator for prognosis of chronicity for chikungunya virus induced arthralgia. high hgf levels correlate with high rates of recovery.excessive local expression of hgf in the breasts has been implicated in macromastia. hgf is also importantly involved in normal mammary gland development.hgf has been implicated in a variety of cancers, including of the lungs, pancreas, thyroid, colon, and breast.increased expression of hgf has been associated with the enhanced and scarless wound healing capabilities of fibroblast cells isolated from the oral mucosa tissue.


=== circulating plasma levels ===
plasma from patients with advanced heart failure presents increased levels of hgf, which correlates with a negative prognosis and a high risk of mortality. circulating hgf has been also identified as a prognostic marker of severity in patients suffering from hypertension. circulating hgf has been also suggested as a precocious biomarker for the acute phase of bowel inflammation.


== pharmacokinetics ==
exogenous hgf administered by intravenous injection is cleared rapidly from circulation by the liver, with a half-life of approximately 4 minutes.


== modulators ==
dihexa is an orally active, centrally penetrant small-molecule compound that directly binds to hgf and potentiates its ability to activate its receptor, c-met. it is a strong inducer of neurogenesis and is being studied for the potential treatment of alzheimer's disease and parkinson's disease.


== interactions ==
hepatocyte growth factor has been shown to interact with the protein product of the c-met oncogene, identified as the hgf receptor (hgfr). both overexpression of the met/hgfr receptor protein and autocrine activation of met/hgfr by simultaneous expression of the hepatocyte growth factor ligand have been implicated in oncogenesis.
hepatocyte growth factor interacts with the sulfated glycosaminoglycans heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate. the interaction with heparan sulfate allows hepatocyte growth factor to form a complex with c-met that is able to transduce intracellular signals leading to cell division and cell migration.

gamma-delta intraepithelial t cell,cell,"gamma delta t cells (γδ t cells) are t cells that have a distinctive t-cell receptor (tcr) on their surface. most t cells are αβ (alpha beta) t cells with tcr composed of two glycoprotein chains called α (alpha) and β (beta) tcr chains. in contrast, gamma delta (γδ) t cells have a tcr that is made up of one γ (gamma) chain and one δ (delta) chain. this group of t cells is usually less common than αβ t cells, but are at their highest abundance in the gut mucosa, within a population of lymphocytes known as intraepithelial lymphocytes (iels).the antigenic molecules that activate gamma delta t cells are still largely unknown. however, γδ t cells are peculiar in that they do not seem to require antigen processing and major-histocompatibility-complex (mhc) presentation of peptide epitopes, although some recognize mhc class ib molecules. furthermore, γδ t cells are believed to have a prominent role in recognition of lipid antigens. they are of an invariant nature and may be triggered by alarm signals, such as heat shock proteins (hsp).
there also exists a γδ-t-cell sub-population within the epidermal compartment of the skin of mice. originally referred to as thy-1+ dendritic epidermal cells (thy1+dec), these cells are more commonly known as dendritic epidermal t cells (detc). detcs arise during fetal development and express an invariant and canonical vγ3 vδ1 t-cell receptor (using garman nomenclature).


== gamma delta t cells in innate and adaptive immunity ==
the conditions that lead to responses of gamma delta t cells are not fully understood, and current concepts of them as 'first line of defense', 'regulatory cells', or 'bridge between innate and adaptive responses' only address facets of their complex behavior. in fact, gamma delta t cells form an entire lymphocyte system that develops under the influence of other leukocytes in the thymus and in the periphery. when mature, they develop into functionally distinct subsets that obey their own (mostly unknown) rules and have countless direct and indirect effects on healthy tissues and immune cells, pathogens and tissues enduring infections, and the host responses to them.
like other 'unconventional' t cell subsets bearing invariant tcrs, such as cd1d-restricted natural killer t cells, gamma delta t cells exhibit several characteristics that place them at the border between the more evolutionarily primitive innate immune system that permits a rapid beneficial response to a variety of foreign agents and the adaptive immune system, where b and t cells coordinate a slower but highly antigen-specific immune response leading to long-lasting memory against subsequent challenges by the same antigen.
gamma delta t cells may be considered a component of adaptive immunity in that they rearrange tcr genes to produce junctional diversity and can develop a memory phenotype. however, the various subsets may also be considered part of the innate immunity in which a specific tcr can function as a pattern recognition receptor. for example, according to this paradigm, large numbers of (human) vγ9/vδ2 t cells respond within hours to common molecules produced by microbes, and highly restricted intraepithelial vδ1 t cells will respond to stressed epithelial cells bearing sentinels of danger.
recent work has shown that human vγ9/vδ2 t cells are also capable of phagocytosis, a function previously exclusive to innate myeloid lineage cells such as neutrophils, monocytes and dendritic cells  this provides further evidence that the biology of gamma delta t cells spans both innate and adaptive immune responses.


== gamma delta t cells in murine thermogenesis ==
recently, it was believed that γδ17 t cells were only able to produce il-17 in acute infections. it was recently discovered that γδ17 t cells can produce il-17 even when the immune response is not induced. these cells are likely to be generated from fetal γδ thymocytes and as they egress from the thymus, they will progress to non-lymphoid tissues such as lungs, peritoneal cavity, dermis, tongue and uterus.the γδ17 t that will accumulate in the adipose tissue (dermis) will not only controls the homeostasis of regulatory t cells but also an adaptive thermogenesis, therefore they are able to control the maintenance of core body temperature. using aging mice as a model, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that act under thermoneutrality circumstances (steady state) or after cold exposure has been recently acknowledged,
when the mice is on a steady state, il-17 produced by the  γδ17 t cells will stimulate stromal cells expressing the il-17 receptor to produce il-33 in vivo, and therefore provide a molecular link to t reg cells expressing the il-33 receptor st2 in the adipose tissue, so st2+ treg cells will accumulate and this will lead to the maintenance of the tissue homeostasis. this recent finding explains the mechanism of why the number of t reg cells continuously increases during aging. on the other hand, it has been shown that after exposing the mice to cold, the production of tnf and il-17 will act on the adipocytes uncoupling the protein ucp1, which is required for inducing a ucp1-dependent thermogenic program.


== gamma delta t cells in autoimmunity ==
autoimmune disease results from abnormal response of immune system. production of autoantibodies or autoreactive t cells is present during such disease. the role of γδ t cell in autoimmune disease is to help b cells to produce autoantibodies, through proinflammatory cytokines. 
il-17a is important for development and progression of autoimmune diseases. main sources are th17 cd4+ αβ t cells, but γδ t cell subset plays role in autoimmune pathogenesis and regulation, too, because they contribute to production of il-17a and other chemokines. they also interact with other innate and adaptive immune cells and modulate their functions. 
γδ t cell enhance or suppress inflammation, depending on the site and stage of disease. 
they rise from periphery and can be accumulated in inflamed tissue. these t cells can become active without tcr ligand – they can induce inflammation in autoimmune diseases very fast.γδ t cells have clinical association with many autoimmune diseases.  


=== idiopathic bowel diseases ibd ===
γδ t cells are a major t cell subset of intraepithelial lymphocytes (iel) present in the epithelial layer of mucosa. they regulate immunosuppressive functions of iels and play role in development of tolerance. these so-called protective γδ t cells promote tissue repair and cell healing. pathogens and other inflammation stimuli cause production of retinoic acid by dendritic cells, it induces γδ t cells to produce il-22. this cytokine is responsible for cell-mediated production of antimicrobial peptides and tissue repair.
on the other hand, pathogenic γδ t cells produce il-17. this cytokine induces th17 cells differentiation, and dendritic cell- mediated production of il-12 and il-23 promotes differentiation of th17 cells to th1 cells, which produce ifn‐γ. matrix metalloproteinases and no present in inflamed tissue damage and degrade basal membrane, leading to development of ibd.


=== type 1 diabetes t1d ===
t1d is an autoimmune disease where β cells of pancreas, which produce insulin, are damaged by autoreactive t cells. there is infiltration of both innate and adaptive immune cells in pancreas. studies on mice showed that γδ t cells play role in t1d pathogenesis. they infiltrate islets and may even co-operate with αβ t cells to induce t1d.


=== rheumatoid arthritis ra ===
ra is a chronic autoimmune disease caused by accumulation of self-reactive t cells, which are induced by inflammation in synovial fluid and joints. ra patients have higher numbers of γδ t cells producing il-17. it leads to production of inflammatory cytokines by neutrophils, macrophages and fibroblasts, and rankl by osteoblasts (rankl causes conversion of precursors into osteoclasts). matrix metalloproteinases and cathepsins induced by inflammatory cytokines, together with rankl, cause bone and cartilage erosion, which leads to ra development.


=== multiple sclerosis ms ===
γδ t cells are involved in development of this autoimmune disease. they are cytotoxic against oligodendrocytes, cells that participate in the myelinization of axons. patients have increased numbers of γδ t cells in brain and cerebrospinal fluid, and these cells accumulate in demyelinated areas of cns and make plaques. in the mice models, different subsets of γδ t cells were identified. the most abundant were the ones producing il-17. il-17 induces th17 cells and th17 response.


=== psoriasis ===
psoriasis is one of the autoimmune diseases in which the γδ t cells together with th1 and th17 play an essential role in the disease development. in response to il-23, the adipose gamma t cells will produce il-17, and this interleukin promotes development and progression of psoriasis. also it has been proven that  vγ9vδ2 t cells in patients suffering from psoriasis participate in the development of the disease. the number of vγ9vδ2 t cells increase in the skin lesions of psoriasis patients but decreased in the blood. this finding indicates redistribution of vγ9vδ2 t cells from the blood to the skin compartment in psoriasis.  the psoriasis severity is associated with lower level of γ9vδ2 t cells in the circulation, therefore a successful anti-psoriatic therapy leads to increase of peripheral vγ9vδ2 t cells. the major outcome is that the measurement of these cells in blood and skin lesions can be used as a marker in order to follow-up the psoriasis progression.


== gamma delta t cells and cancer ==
non-mhc restricted recognition of antigens and high cytokine secretion of γδ t cells suggest that these cells would be effective in cancer immunotherapy. trials in numerous cancers (renal carcinoma, leukemia, lung cancer) showed that they are tolerated and safe, but on the other hand, there are reports saying that γδ t cells cause cancer development for example through production of il-17 in cancer microenvironment, which promotes angiogenesis and cell growth or because their ability to increase numbers of myeloid derived suppressor cells.
therefore the effectiveness of immunotherapy based on γδ t cells is limited. 
γδ t cells can be divided into two groups: effector and regulatory γδ t cells:


=== effector functions of γδ t cells ===
after infiltrating tumor as a response to chemokines produced by monocytes and macrophages, γδ t cells interact with stress-induced molecules on tumor cells and secrete cytotoxic molecules, inflammatory cytokines and activate adaptive immunity cells.
they can also lyse tumor cells by antibody‐dependent cellular cytotoxicity (adcc) (through binding fc region of igg deposited on tumor cells). γδ t cells secrete ifn-γ and il-17, which leads to higher expression of mhc-i, positive regulation of cytotoxic t lymphocytes and induction of anti-tumor response. γδ t cells also interact with dcs and develop th1 response. 


=== regulatory functions of γδ t cells ===
besides effector functions, γδ t cells have regulatory and suppressive role in the tumor microenvironment through expression of transcription factors (foxp3, helios) and cd86-ctla-4 interaction between apcs and γδ t cells. they also impair effector immune cells (dc, nk, inkt, cd8+ t cells) through il-4, il-10 and tgf-β. 
also il-17 secreted by γδ t cells has pro-tumorogenic role (enhanced angiogenesis, recruitment of macrophages, expansion and polarization of neutrophils and their suppression of cd8+ t cells).


== gene families in different species ==


=== laboratory mice (mus musculus) ===


==== mouse vγ chains ====
this table summarizes the nomenclature of mouse vγ chains and indicates monoclonal antibodies often used to identify these chains.  this system has been best described in strain c57bl/6 and might not apply well to other strains. there are two systems of nomenclature in use (heilig; garman), and many writers do not indicate which system they use. for example, the imgt (international immunogenetics information system) uses the heilig notation, but does not indicate this fact on its website. this table refers to variable chain vγ gene segments and to monoclonal antibodies that detect the corresponding vγ protein chains.  note that adrian hayday's proposed nomenclature is not widely used, leaving considerable confusion in the literature. one advantage and weakness of the hayday nomenclature is that it is based on the gene order in the b6 genome, but this might not apply to other strains.


=== human forms ===


==== human vδ2+ t cells ====
vγ9/vδ2 t cells are unique to humans and primates and represent a minor and unconventional constituent of the leukocyte population in peripheral blood (0.5-5%), yet they are assumed to play an early and essential role in sensing 'danger' by invading pathogens as they expand dramatically in many acute infections and may exceed all other lymphocytes within a few days, e.g. in tuberculosis, salmonellosis, ehrlichiosis, brucellosis, tularemia, listeriosis, toxoplasmosis, and malaria.
of note, all vγ9/vδ2 t cells recognize the same small microbial compound (e)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate (hmb-pp), a natural intermediate of the non-mevalonate pathway of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (ipp) biosynthesis. hmb-pp is an essential metabolite in most pathogenic bacteria including mycobacterium tuberculosis and malaria parasites, but is absent from the human host. bacterial species that lack the non-mevalonate pathway and synthesize ipp via the classical mevalonate pathway instead, such as streptococcus, staphylococcus, and borrelia, are unable to produce hmb-pp and do not specifically activate vγ9/vδ2 t cells.
ipp itself is structurally closely related to hmb-pp and ubiquitously present in all living cells (including human cells), yet its potency in vitro is reduced 10,000-fold; whether ipp represents a physiological 'danger' signal of stressed or transformed cells is still unclear. of pharmacological interest and with bioactivities comparable to that of ipp are synthetic aminobisphosphonates such as zoledronate (zometa) or pamidronate (aredia), that are widely used to treat osteoporosis and bone metastases, and incidentally act as vγ9/vδ2 t cell receptor agonists.  however, increasing evidence suggests that these aminobisphosphonate 'antigens' are not recognised directly by vγ9/vδ2 t cells and in fact act indirectly, via their effects on the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway, leading to an accumulation of ipp. finally, certain alkylated amines have been described to activate vγ9/vδ2 t cells in vitro, however only at millimolar concentrations, i.e. with potencies 106-108-fold lower than those of hmb-pp, thereby raising questions about their physiological relevance.
it is still not clear whether these non-peptidic antigens bind directly to the vγ9/vδ2 tcr or if a presenting element exists. there is evidence for a requirement for a species-specific cell-cell contact. however, none of the known antigen-presenting molecules like mhc class i and ii or cd1 are required for γδ t cell activation suggesting the existence of a novel presenting element. strong support for a direct recognition of non-peptide antigens by the vγ9/vδ2 tcr comes from studies which demonstrated that a transfected vγ9/vδ2 tcr can confer responsiveness onto a hitherto unresponsive cell; furthermore, antibodies to the γδ tcr block recognition. thus, the presence of a functional vγ9/vδ2 tcr appears mandatory for a response to non-peptidic antigens although the basis for the huge differences in bioactivity between closely related molecules like hmb-pp and ipp cannot be explained by conventional epitope presentation/recognition models.
these vγ9vδ2 t cells can also behave like professional antigen-presenting cells (apc). it seems that human vγ9vδ2 t cells are characterized by a specific inflammatory migration program, including multiple receptors for inflammatory chemokines (cxcr3, ccr1, ccr2 and ccr5). it means that the stimulation with ipp or hmb-pp induces migration to the lymphatic tissues, specifically to the t cell area of lymph nodes. so the stimulation of vγ9vδ2 t cells with phosphoantigens results in expression of multiple markers which are associated with apc, like mhc i and ii molecules, 
co-stimulatory molecules (cd80, cd86) and adhesion receptors (cd11a, cd18, cd54).  thus activated vγ9vδ2 t cells behave like apcs (γδ t-apc) and present antigens to αβ t cells. this leads to turn of naïve cd4+ and cd8+ αβ t cells into effector cells. the differentiation, induced by γδ t-apc, most often led to t helper cell response, in the most of cases to pro-inflammatory th1 response with subsequent production of ifn-γ and tnf-α. but in the case of a low γδ t-apc: cd4+ ratio it leads to differentiation of some naïve αβ t cells into th2 (il-4) or th0 (il-4 plus ifn-γ) cells. human vγ9vδ2 t cells are also cells with excellent antigen cross-presentation activity, a process describing the uptake of exogenous antigen and its routing to the mhc i pathway for induction cd8+ cytotoxic t cells. thus activated cytotoxic t cells can effectively kill infected or tumor cells. this fact can be used in the immunotherapy of cancer and infectious diseases.


==== human non-vδ2+ t cells ====
the extensive structural diversity of vδ1 and vδ3 tcrs and the existence of vδ1+ clones reactive against mhc, mhc-like, or non-mhc molecules suggest recognition of a highly diverse and heterogeneous set of antigens by non-vδ2 cells, although cognate interactions between non-vδ2 tcrs and any of these antigens have not been shown yet. mhc class-i-chain-related gene a (mica) has also been proposed as an important tumor antigen recognized by vδ1+ t cells. however, the very low affinity of mica–vδ1 tcr interactions estimated by surface plasmon resonance analyses raises doubts about the functional relevance of mica or mhc class-i-chain-related gene b (micb) recognition by vδ1+ tcrs.
non-vδ2 γδ t cells are expanded in various infectious contexts involving intracellular bacteria (mycobacteria and listeria) as well as extracellular bacteria, such as borrelia burgdorferi and viruses (hiv, cytomegalovirus). in most instances, the stimuli that trigger vd1 expansion are not derived from pathogens but instead correspond to endogenous gene products presumably upregulated on infection. the antigens recognized by non-vδ2 t cells expanded in the above infectious contexts have not been characterized, but the fact that vδ1+ t-cell responses are not blocked by monoclonal antibody directed against known classical or non-classical mhc molecules suggests recognition of a new class of conserved stress-induced antigens.
a recent study has identified a specific subset of gut-resident vδ1 iels (intraepithelial lymphocytes) which express high levels of a natural cytotoxic receptor  (ncr) which is nkp46. these receptors are expressed almost exclusively by natural killer (nk) cells and play a central role in triggering their activation, but it has been described that γδ t cells can express these receptors. these cells are named nkp46+/vδ1 iels.
the major outcome of this study is the clinical relevance of this cells, which can be used a prognostic marker in the colorectal cancer (crc), in order to follow-up its progression. lower frequencies of nkp46+/vδ1 iels in healthy intestinal tissues surrounding the tumor mass, associate with a higher tumor progression and metastasis. it is acknowledged that this subset can control the metastasis, so the higher levels of this population, the less probabilities for the tumor to progress and proliferate to other tissues.

integrin alpha-11 (human),protein,"integrin alpha-11 is a protein that, in humans, is encoded by the itga11 gene.this gene encodes an alpha integrin. integrins are heterodimeric integral membrane proteins composed of an alpha chain and a beta chain. this protein contains an i domain, is expressed in muscle tissue, dimerizes with beta 1 integrin in vitro, and appears to bind collagen in this form. therefore, the protein may be involved in attaching muscle tissue to the extracellular matrix. alternative transcriptional splice variants have been found for this gene, but their biological validity is not determined.according to one study, itga11 expression is increased in the anterior stroma of corneal buttons excised from the eyes affected by keratoconus.

apolipoprotein b receptor isoform h2 (human),protein,"apolipoprotein e (apoe) is a protein involved in the metabolism of fats in the body of mammals. a subtype is implicated in alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disease.apoe belongs to a family of fat-binding proteins called apolipoproteins.  in the circulation, it is present as part of several classes of lipoprotein particles, including chylomicron remnants, vldl, idl, and some hdl. apoe interacts significantly with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr), which is essential for the normal processing (catabolism) of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. in peripheral tissues, apoe is primarily produced by the liver and macrophages, and mediates cholesterol metabolism. in the central nervous system, apoe is mainly produced by astrocytes and transports cholesterol to neurons via apoe receptors, which are members of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family. apoe is the principal cholesterol carrier in the brain. apoe qualifies as a checkpoint inhibitor of the classical complement pathway by complex formation with activated c1q.

apolipoproteins are not unique to mammals. many terrestrial and marine vertebrates have versions of them.  proteins similar in function have been found in choanoflagellates, suggesting that they are a very old class of proteins predating the dawn of all living animals.  it is believed that apoe arose via gene duplications of apoc-i before the fish-mammal split 400 million years ago.the three major human alleles (e4, e3, e2) arose after the primate-human split around 7.5 million years ago.  these alleles are the by-product of non-synonymous mutations which led to changes in functionality.  the first allele to emerge was e4. after the primate-human split, there were four amino acid changes in the human lineage, three of which had no effect on protein function (v174l, a18t, a135v). the fourth substitution traded a threonine for an arginine altering the protein's functionality. this substitution occurred somewhere in the 6 million year gap between the primate-human split and the denisovan-human split, since exactly the same substitutions were found in denisovan apoe.about 220,000 years ago, an arginine to cysteine substitution took place at amino acid 112 (arg112cys) of the apoe4 gene, and this resulted in the e3 allele. finally, 80,000 years ago, another arginine to cysteine substitution at amino acid 158 (arg158cys) of the apoe3 gene created the e2 allele.


== structure ==


=== gene ===
the gene, apoe, is mapped to chromosome 19 in a  cluster with apolipoprotein c1 (apoc1) and the apolipoprotein c2 (apoc2). the apoe gene consists of four exons and three introns, totaling 3597 base pairs. apoe is transcriptionally activated by the liver x receptor (an important regulator of cholesterol, fatty acid, and glucose homeostasis) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, nuclear receptors that form heterodimers with retinoid x receptors. in melanocytic cells apoe gene expression may be regulated by mitf.


=== protein ===
apoe is 299 amino acids long and contains multiple amphipathic α-helices. according to crystallography studies, a hinge region connects the n- and c-terminal regions of the protein. the n-terminal region (residues 1–167) forms an anti-parallel four-helix bundle such that the non-polar sides face inside the protein. meanwhile, the c-terminal domain (residues 206–299) contains three α-helices which form a large exposed hydrophobic surface and interact with those in the n-terminal helix bundle domain through hydrogen bonds and salt-bridges. the c-terminal region also contains a low density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr)-binding site.


=== polymorphisms ===
apoe is polymorphic,  with three major alleles (epsilon 2, epsilon 3, and epsilon 4): apoe-ε2 (cys112, cys158), apoe-ε3 (cys112, arg158), and apoe-ε4 (arg112, arg158). 
although these allelic forms differ from each other by only one or two amino acids at positions 112 and 158, these differences alter apoe structure and function.

as of 2007, much remained to be learned about the apoe isoforms, including the interaction of other potentially protective genetic polymorphisms, so caution is advised before making determinant statements about the influence of apoe polymorphisms on cognition and the development of alzheimer's disease. as of 2007, there was no evidence that apoe polymorphisms influence cognition in younger age groups (other than possible increased episodic memory ability and neural efficiency in younger apoe4 age groups), nor that the apoe4 isoform places individuals at increased risk for any infectious disease.


== function ==
apoe transports lipids, fat-soluble vitamins, and cholesterol into the lymph system and then into the blood. it is synthesized principally in the liver, but has also been found in other tissues such as the brain, kidneys, and spleen. in the nervous system, non-neuronal cell types, most notably astroglia and microglia, are the primary producers of apoe, while neurons preferentially express the receptors for apoe. there are seven currently identified mammalian receptors for apoe which belong to the evolutionarily conserved ldlr family.apoe was initially recognized for its importance in lipoprotein metabolism and cardiovascular disease. defects in apoe result in familial dysbetalipoproteinemia aka type iii hyperlipoproteinemia (hlp iii), in which increased plasma cholesterol and triglycerides are the consequence of impaired clearance of chylomicron, vldl and ldl. more recently, it has been studied for its role in several biological processes not directly related to lipoprotein transport, including alzheimer's disease (ad), immunoregulation, and cognition. though the exact mechanisms remain to be elucidated, isoform 4 of apoe, encoded by an apoe allele, has been associated with increased calcium ion levels and apoptosis following mechanical injury.in the field of immune regulation, a growing number of studies point to apoe's interaction with many immunological processes, including suppressing t cell proliferation, macrophage functioning regulation, lipid antigen presentation facilitation (by cd1) to natural killer t cell as well as modulation of inflammation and oxidation. apoe is produced by macrophages and apoe secretion has been shown to be restricted to classical monocytes in pbmc, and the secretion of apoe by monocytes is down regulated by inflammatory cytokines and upregulated by tgf-beta.


== clinical significance ==


=== alzheimer's disease ===
as of 2012, the e4 variant was the largest known genetic risk factor for late-onset sporadic alzheimer's disease (ad) in a variety of ethnic groups. however, the e4 variant does not correlate with risk in every population. nigerian people have the highest observed frequency of the apoe4 allele in world populations, but ad is rare among them. this may be due to their low cholesterol levels. caucasian and japanese carriers of two e4 alleles have between 10 and 30 times the risk of developing ad by 75 years of age, as compared to those not carrying any e4 alleles. this may be caused by an interaction with amyloid. alzheimer's disease is characterized by build-ups of aggregates of the peptide beta-amyloid. apolipoprotein e enhances proteolytic break-down of this peptide, both within and between cells. the isoform apoe-ε4 is not as effective as the others at promoting these reactions, resulting in increased vulnerability to ad in individuals with that gene variation.although 40–65% of ad patients have at least one copy of the ε4 allele, apoe4 is not a determinant of the disease. at least one third of patients with ad are apoe4 negative and some apoe4 homozygotes never develop the disease. yet those with two ε4 alleles have up to 20 times the risk of developing ad. there is also evidence that the apoe2 allele may serve a protective role in ad. thus, the genotype most at risk for alzheimer's disease and at an earlier age is apoe4,4.  using genotype apoe3,3 as a benchmark (with the persons who have this genotype regarded as having a risk level of 1.0), individuals with genotype apoe4,4 have an odds ratio of 14.9 of developing alzheimer's disease. individuals with the apoe3,4 genotype face an odds ratio of 3.2, and people with a copy of the 2 allele and the 4 allele (apoe2,4), have an odds ratio of 2.6.  persons with one copy each of the 2 allele and the 3 allele (apoe2,3) have an odds ratio of 0.6. persons with two copies of the 2 allele (apoe2,2) also have an odds ratio of 0.6.
while apoe4 has been found to greatly increase the odds that an individual will develop alzheimer's, a 2002 study concluded, that in persons with any combination of apoe alleles, high serum total cholesterol and high blood pressure in mid-life are independent risk factors which together can nearly triple the risk that the individual will later develop ad. projecting from their data, some researchers have suggested that lowering serum cholesterol levels may reduce a person's risk for alzheimer's disease, even if they have two apoe4 alleles, thus reducing the risk from nine or ten times the odds of getting ad down to just two times the odds.women are more likely to develop ad than men across most ages and apoe genotypes. premorbid women with the ε4 allele have significantly more neurological dysfunction than men.


=== cognitive impairment after soccer ball heading ===
a 2020 publication as part of the ""einstein soccer study"" showed that in 350 adult soccer players those with at least one copy of apoe4 gene allele had a stronger association between a 12-month soccer ball heading experience and worse verbal memory performance than their peers without the allele.


=== atherosclerosis ===
knockout mice that lack the apolipoprotein-e gene (apoe−/−) develop extreme hypercholesterolemia when fed a high-fat diet.


=== malaria ===
apoe−/− knockout mice show marked attenuation of cerebral malaria and increased survival, as well as decreased sequestration of parasites and t cells within the brain, likely due to protection of the blood-brain barrier. human studies have shown that the apoe2 polymorphism correlates with earlier infection, and apoe3/4 polymorphisms increase likelihood of severe malaria.

trovafloxacin,antibiotic,"trovafloxacin (sold as trovan by pfizer and turvel by laboratorios almirall) is a broad spectrum antibiotic that inhibits the uncoiling of supercoiled dna in various bacteria by blocking the activity of dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv. it was withdrawn from the market due to the risk of hepatotoxicity. it had better gram-positive bacterial coverage and less gram-negative coverage than the previous fluoroquinolones.


== adverse reactions ==
trovafloxacin use is significantly restricted due to its high potential for inducing serious and sometimes fatal liver damage. currently, the drug is not approved for use in the u.s. or the european union due to association with cases of acute liver failure and death.


== manufacturing ==

the key reaction in building the ring consists of 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of ethyl diazoacetate to n-cbz-3-pyrroline to afford the pyrrazolidine (3). pyrolysis results in loss of nitrogen and formation of the cyclopropylpyrrolidine ring. the stereochemistry of the ring simply reflects the thermodynamics, since cis ring fusion is by far the most stable arrangement, as is the cis configuration of the ester group. the ester is then saponified to the corresponding carboxylic acid (5). the acid undergoes a version of the curtius rearrangement when treated with diphenylphosphoryl azide (dppa) to afford the transient isocyanate (6). the reactive function adds t-buoh from the reaction medium to afford the product as its tert-butyloxycarbonyl protecting group derivative (7). catalytic hydrogenation then removes the carbobenzyloxy protecting group to afford the secondary amine (8). in a standard quinoline reaction, this amine is then used to displace the more reactive fluorine at the 7-position in ethyl 1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-6,7-difluoro-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylate (9).


== society and culture ==


=== legal status ===
the u.s. food and drug administration approved trovafloxacin for therapeutic use in december 1997 for use in patients aged 18 years and older. in june 1999, the agency advised doctors to limit the prescription of trovafloxacin due to adverse events associated with the drug (over 100 cases of acute liver injury reported to fda). in may 2000, the fda withdrew marketing authorisation for trovafloxacin.
trovafloxacin received marketing authorisation in the european union in october 1998. in june 1999, in view of reported adverse events, the committee for proprietary medicinal products recommended suspension of the marketing authorisation for a year. the suspension took effect in august 1999 and was renewed in september 2000. in october 2000, pfizer notified the european commission of its decision to voluntarily withdraw the marketing authorisation which was approved by ema in march 2001.


=== economics ===
trovan sales during its first full year on the market contributed us$160 million of pfizer's total revenue of us$12.6 billion. investors expected it to eventually bring in us$1 billion per year.


=== nigerian clinical trial controversy ===

in 1996, during a meningitis epidemic in kano, nigeria, the drug was administered to approximately 200 infected children. eleven children died in the trial: five after taking trovan and six after taking an older antibiotic used for comparison in the clinical trial. others suffered blindness, deafness and brain damage, common consequences of meningitis that have not been seen in patients treated with trovafloxacin for other infection types. an investigation by the washington post concluded that pfizer had administered the drug as part of an illegal clinical trial without authorization from the nigerian government or consent from the children's parents. the case came to light in december 2000 as the result of an investigation by the washington post, and sparked significant public outcry. the most serious error was the falsification and backdating of an ethics approval letter by the lead investigator of the trial, dr. abdulhamid isa dutse. dr. dutse is now the chief medical officer of aminu kano teaching hospital. the result of the trial was that children treated with oral trovafloxacin had a 5% (5/100) mortality rate compared to a 6% (6/100) mortality rate with intramuscular ceftriaxone.
between 2002 and 2005 the victims of the trovan tests in nigeria filed a series of unsuccessful lawsuits in the united states.  however, in january 2009, the united states court of appeals for the second circuit ruled that the nigerian victims and their families were entitled to bring suit against pfizer in the united states under the alien tort statute. a us$75 million settlement with the state of kano was reached on july 30, 2009. 
additionally two lawsuits also remain pending in new york, united states. according to wikileaked us embassy cables, pfizer's country manager admitted that ""pfizer had hired investigators to uncover corruption links to federal attorney general michael aondoakaa to expose him and put pressure on him to drop the federal cases.""

aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 2 isoform m1 (mouse),protein,"the arnt gene encodes the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator protein that forms a complex with ligand-bound aryl hydrocarbon receptor (ahr), and is required for receptor function. the encoded protein has also been identified as the beta subunit of a heterodimeric transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (hif1). a t(1;12)(q21;p13) translocation, which results in a tel-arnt fusion protein, is associated with acute myeloblastic leukemia. three alternatively spliced variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene.
the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (ahr) is involved in the induction of several enzymes that participate in xenobiotic metabolism. the ligand-free, cytosolic form of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor is complexed to heat shock protein 90. binding of ligand, which includes dioxin and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, results in translocation of the ligand-binding subunit only into the nucleus. induction of enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism occurs through binding of the ligand-bound ahr to xenobiotic responsive elements in the promoters of genes for these enzymes.

type iii cell of adrenal cortex,cell,"corticosteroids are a class of steroid hormones that are produced in the adrenal cortex of vertebrates, as well as the synthetic analogues of these hormones. two main classes of corticosteroids, glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, are involved in a wide range of physiological processes, including stress response, immune response, and regulation of inflammation, carbohydrate metabolism, protein catabolism, blood electrolyte levels, and behavior.some common naturally occurring steroid hormones are cortisol (c21h30o5), corticosterone (c21h30o4), cortisone (c21h28o5) and aldosterone (c21h28o5). (note that cortisone and aldosterone are isomers.) the main corticosteroids produced by the adrenal cortex are cortisol and aldosterone.


== classes ==

glucocorticoids such as cortisol affect carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism, and have anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, anti-proliferative, and vasoconstrictive effects. anti-inflammatory effects are mediated by blocking the action of inflammatory mediators (transrepression) and inducing anti-inflammatory mediators (transactivation). immunosuppressive effects are mediated by suppressing delayed hypersensitivity reactions by direct action on t-lymphocytes. anti-proliferative effects are mediated by inhibition of dna synthesis and epidermal cell turnover. vasoconstrictive effects are mediated by inhibiting the action of inflammatory mediators such as histidine.
mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone are primarily involved in the regulation of electrolyte and water balance by modulating ion transport in the epithelial cells of the renal tubules of the kidney.


== medical uses ==
synthetic pharmaceutical drugs with corticosteroid-like effects are used in a variety of conditions, ranging from brain tumors to skin diseases. dexamethasone and its derivatives are almost pure glucocorticoids, while prednisone and its derivatives have some mineralocorticoid action in addition to the glucocorticoid effect. fludrocortisone (florinef) is a synthetic mineralocorticoid. hydrocortisone (cortisol) is typically used for replacement therapy, e.g. for adrenal insufficiency and congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
medical conditions treated with systemic corticosteroids:

topical formulations are also available for the skin, eyes (uveitis), lungs (asthma), nose (rhinitis),  and bowels. corticosteroids are also used supportively to prevent nausea, often in combination with 5-ht3 antagonists (e.g. ondansetron).
typical undesired effects of glucocorticoids present quite uniformly as drug-induced cushing's syndrome. typical mineralocorticoid side-effects are hypertension (abnormally high blood pressure), steroid induced diabetes mellitus, psychosis, poor sleep, hypokalemia (low potassium levels in the blood), hypernatremia (high sodium levels in the blood) without causing peripheral edema, metabolic alkalosis and connective tissue weakness. wound healing or ulcer formation may be inhibited by the immunosuppressive effects.
clinical and experimental evidence indicates that corticosteroids can cause permanent eye damage by inducing central serous retinopathy (csr, also known as central serous chorioretinopathy, csc). this should be borne in mind when treating patients with optic neuritis. there is experimental and clinical evidence that, at least in optic neuritis speed of treatment initiation is important.a variety of steroid medications, from anti-allergy nasal sprays (nasonex, flonase) to topical skin creams, to eye drops (tobradex), to prednisone have been implicated in the development of csr.corticosteroids have been widely used in treating people with traumatic brain injury. a systematic review identified 20 randomised controlled trials and included 12,303 participants, then compared patients who received corticosteroids with patients who received no treatment.  the authors recommended people with traumatic head injury should not be routinely treated with corticosteroids.


== pharmacology ==
corticosteroids act as agonists of the glucocorticoid receptor and/or the mineralocorticoid receptor.
in addition to their corticosteroid activity, some corticosteroids may have some progestogenic activity and may produce sex-related side effects.


== pharmacogenetics ==


=== asthma ===
patients' response to inhaled corticosteroids has some basis in genetic variations. two genes of interest are chrh1 (corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1) and tbx21 (transcription factor t-bet). both genes display some degree of polymorphic variation in humans, which may explain how some patients respond better to inhaled corticosteroid therapy than others. however, not all asthma patients respond to corticosteroids and large sub groups of asthma patients are corticosteroid resistant.


== adverse effects ==

use of corticosteroids has numerous side-effects, some of which may be severe:

severe amebic colitis: fulminant amebic colitis is associated with high case fatality and can occur in patients infected with the parasite entamoeba histolytica after exposure to corticosteroid medications.
neuropsychiatric: steroid psychosis, and anxiety, depression. therapeutic doses may cause a feeling of artificial well-being (""steroid euphoria""). the neuropsychiatric effects are partly mediated by sensitization of the body to the actions of adrenaline. therapeutically, the bulk of corticosteroid dose is given in the morning to mimic the body's diurnal rhythm; if given at night, the feeling of being energized will interfere with sleep. an extensive review is provided by flores and gumina.
cardiovascular: corticosteroids can cause sodium retention through a direct action on the kidney, in a manner analogous to the mineralocorticoid aldosterone. this can result in fluid retention and hypertension.
metabolic: corticosteroids cause a movement of body fat to the face and torso, resulting in ""moon face"", ""buffalo hump"", and ""pot belly"" or ""beer belly"", and cause movement of body fat away from the limbs. this has been termed corticosteroid-induced lipodystrophy. due to the diversion of amino-acids to glucose, they are considered anti-anabolic, and long term therapy can cause muscle wasting.
endocrine: by increasing the production of glucose from amino-acid breakdown and opposing the action of insulin, corticosteroids can cause hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus.
skeletal: steroid-induced osteoporosis may be a side-effect of long-term corticosteroid use.  use of inhaled corticosteroids among children with asthma may result in decreased height.
gastro-intestinal: while cases of colitis have been reported, corticosteroids are often prescribed when the colitis, although due to suppression of the immune response to pathogens, should be considered only after ruling out infection or microbe/fungal overgrowth in the gastrointestinal tract. while the evidence for corticosteroids causing peptic ulceration is relatively poor except for high doses taken for over a month, the majority of doctors as of 2010 still believe this is the case, and would consider protective prophylactic measures.
eyes: chronic use may predispose to cataract and glaucoma.
vulnerability to infection: by suppressing immune reactions (which is one of the main reasons for their use in allergies), steroids may cause infections to flare up, notably candidiasis.
pregnancy: corticosteroids have a low but significant teratogenic effect, causing a few birth defects per 1,000 pregnant women treated. corticosteroids are therefore contraindicated in pregnancy.
habituation: topical steroid addiction (tsa) or red burning skin has been reported in long-term users of topical steroids (users who applied topical steroids to their skin over a period of weeks, months, or years). tsa is characterised by uncontrollable, spreading dermatitis and worsening skin inflammation which requires a stronger topical steroid to get the same result as the first prescription. when topical steroid medication is lost, the skin experiences redness, burning, itching, hot skin, swelling, and/or oozing for a length of time. this is also called 'red skin syndrome' or 'topical steroid withdrawal' (tsw). after the withdrawal period is over the atopic dermatitis can cease or is less severe than it was before.
in children the short term use of steroids by mouth increases the risk of vomiting, behavioral changes, and sleeping problems.


== biosynthesis ==

the corticosteroids are synthesized from cholesterol within the adrenal cortex. most steroidogenic reactions are catalysed by enzymes of the cytochrome p450 family. they are located within the mitochondria and require adrenodoxin as a cofactor (except 21-hydroxylase and 17α-hydroxylase).
aldosterone and corticosterone share the first part of their biosynthetic pathway. the last part is mediated either by the aldosterone synthase (for aldosterone) or by the 11β-hydroxylase (for corticosterone). these enzymes are nearly identical (they share 11β-hydroxylation and 18-hydroxylation functions), but aldosterone synthase is also able to perform an 18-oxidation. moreover, aldosterone synthase is found within the zona glomerulosa at the outer edge of the adrenal cortex; 11β-hydroxylase is found in the zona fasciculata and zona glomerulosa.


== classification of corticosteroid ==


=== by chemical structure ===
in general, corticosteroids are grouped into four classes, based on chemical structure. allergic reactions to one member of a class typically indicate an intolerance of all members of the class. this is known as the ""coopman classification"".the highlighted steroids are often used in the screening of allergies to topical steroids.

hydrocortisone, hydrocortisone acetate, cortisone acetate, tixocortol pivalate, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, prednisone


==== group b – acetonides (and related substances) ====
amcinonide, budesonide, desonide, fluocinolone acetonide, fluocinonide, halcinonide, and triamcinolone acetonide.


==== group c – betamethasone type ====
beclometasone, betamethasone, dexamethasone, fluocortolone, halometasone, and mometasone.


==== group d – esters ====


===== group d1 – halogenated (less labile) =====
alclometasone dipropionate, betamethasone dipropionate, betamethasone valerate, clobetasol propionate, clobetasone butyrate, fluprednidene acetate, and mometasone furoate.


===== group d2 – labile prodrug esters =====
ciclesonide, cortisone acetate, hydrocortisone aceponate, hydrocortisone acetate, hydrocortisone buteprate, hydrocortisone butyrate, hydrocortisone valerate, prednicarbate, and tixocortol pivalate.


=== by route of administration ===


==== topical steroids ====

for use topically on the skin, eye, and mucous membranes.
topical corticosteroids are divided in potency classes i to iv in most countries (a to d in japan). seven categories are used in the united states to determine the level of potency of any given topical corticosteroid.


==== inhaled steroids ====
for nasal mucosa, sinuses, bronchi, and lungs.
this group includes:

flunisolide
fluticasone furoate
fluticasone propionate
triamcinolone acetonide
beclomethasone dipropionate
budesonide
mometasone furoate
ciclesonidethere also exist certain combination preparations such as advair diskus in the united states, containing fluticasone propionate and salmeterol (a long-acting bronchodilator), and symbicort, containing budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate (another long-acting bronchodilator). they are both approved for use in children over 12 years old.


==== oral forms ====
such as prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, or dexamethasone.


==== systemic forms ====
available in injectables for intravenous and parenteral routes.


== history ==
tadeusz reichstein, edward calvin kendall. and philip showalter hench were awarded the nobel prize for physiology and medicine in 1950 for their work on hormones of the adrenal cortex, which culminated in the isolation of cortisone.initially hailed as a miracle cure and liberally prescribed during the 1950s, steroid treatment brought about adverse events of such a magnitude that the next major category of anti-inflammatory drugs, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), was so named in order to demarcate from the opprobrium. corticosteroids were voted allergen of the year in 2005 by the american contact dermatitis society.lewis sarett of merck & co. was the first to synthesize cortisone, using a 36-step process that started with deoxycholic acid, which was extracted from ox bile. the low efficiency of converting deoxycholic acid into cortisone led to a cost of us$200 per gram. russell marker, at syntex, discovered a much cheaper and more convenient starting material, diosgenin from wild mexican yams. his conversion of diosgenin into progesterone by a four-step process now known as marker degradation was an important step in mass production of all steroidal hormones, including cortisone and chemicals used in hormonal contraception.in 1952, d.h. peterson and h.c. murray of upjohn developed a process that used rhizopus mold to oxidize progesterone into a compound that was readily converted to cortisone. the ability to cheaply synthesize large quantities of cortisone from the diosgenin in yams resulted in a rapid drop in price to us$6 per gram, falling to $0.46 per gram by 1980. percy julian's research also aided progress in the field. the exact nature of cortisone's anti-inflammatory action remained a mystery for years after, however, until the leukocyte adhesion cascade and the role of phospholipase a2 in the production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes was fully understood in the early 1980s.


=== etymology ===
the cortico- part of the name refers to the adrenal cortex, which makes these steroid hormones. thus a corticosteroid is a ""cortex steroid"".

bezlotoxumab injection,drug,"bezlotoxumab, sold under the brand name zinplava, is a human monoclonal antibody designed for the prevention of recurrence of clostridium difficile infections.this drug, along with actoxumab, was developed through phase ii efficacy trials by a partnership between medarex inc and massbiologics of the university of massachusetts medical school. the project was then licensed to merck sharp & dohme corp for further development and commercialization.actoxumab and bezlotoxumab are fully human monoclonal antibodies which bind c. difficile toxins a and b, respectively.
a phase iii trial only showed a benefit from bezlotoxumab; the combination of actoxumab and bezlotoxumab worked no better to prevent recurrence of c. difficile associated diarrhea than bezlotoxumab alone.


== progress towards fda approval ==
on june 9, 2016, the u.s. fda's antimicrobial drugs advisory committee (formerly known as the anti-infective drugs advisory committee) met to discuss bezlotoxumab. the committee voted to recommend approval of merck's license application by a vote of 10 to 5, generally expressing a willingness to accept that the trials had proven that bezlotoxumab decreased recurrence of c. difficile overall. the committee tempered this acceptance with a robust discussion of whether or not the drug provide more marked benefit in some patient groups and expressed concern over a potential safety signal in the group treated with bezlotoxumab. the data suggested that bezlotoxumab might have the most benefit in sicker, high-risk patients but did show a statistical benefit in all patient subgroups. although the patient population as a whole contained many very sick individuals and thus there were many adverse events in both the subjects receiving placebo and those receiving bezlotoxumab, the panel focused on a small number of serious events in patients with pre-existing congestive heart failure. in this subset the patients receiving bezlotoxumab appeared to have a higher rate of negative outcomes than the placebo group, although there many have been imbalance in how sick the patients in those groups were.the prescription drug user fee act (pdufa) action date for the fda's review of bezlotoxumab is july 23, 2016.bezlotoxumab gained fda approval in october 2016: ""indicated to reduce the recurrence of clostridium difficile infection (cdi) in patients 18 years of age or older who are receiving antibiotics for cdi and are at high risk for recurrence.""


== mechanism of tcdb neutralization ==
by x-ray crystallized structure of n-terminal of clostridium difficile toxin b (tcdb), the toxin was identified to consist of three domains: a gtd, a cysteine protease and a combined repetitive oligopeptides, crop domain. the crop domain consists of four different peptide units: b1, b2, b3, and b4. bezlotoxumab specifically inhibits the crop domain of tcdb. it recognizes a specific epitope on toxin tcdb and has high affinity for that region. the gtd domain does not interact with bezlotoxumab, but appears to interact with b1, which is representative of the entire crop domain. bezlotoxumab interacts with either b2 and b3 or the overlapping residues region between the two domains. the b4 fragment does not interact with the specific portion of the crop domain. characterization of peptide b1 as full crop domain of tcdb suggests that the antibody specifically reacts with the b2 region of the crop domain. the leads to the conclusion that tcdb epitope lies within the n-terminus of the crop domain.

finisterre universe,non_science,"the finisterre universe is a fictional universe created by american science fiction and fantasy author c. j. cherryh. currently, it comprises a series of two science fiction / horror novels written by cherryh, rider at the gate (1995) and cloud's rider (1996), also known as the rider series. they were published by warner books in the us and hodder & stoughton in the united kingdom. the series is about the descendants of lost colonists stranded many generations ago on the hostile planet of finisterre. for continuity, the two novels should be read in publication sequence.


== background ==
finisterre (""end of the earth"") is an earth-like planet targeted for colonisation, but the colonists soon discover that what they thought was a hospitable world is not suitable for humans at all because the local fauna is telepathic. these creatures send and receive images to and from the ambient, which the unwary humans intercepted, resulting in a mind-clouding ""noise"" that distressed many of the settlers and even drove some of them mad. to make matters worse, the mothership that delivered the colonists to the planet never returned.  underscoring the colonists' difficult situation, cherryh has described anne mccaffrey's pern and marion zimmer bradley's darkover worlds as having the same underlying characteristic as finisterre in terms of being ""a bad real estate deal."" with nowhere to go, finisterre's colonists therefore built and retreated into encampments surrounded by wooden palisade walls, and hid behind religious dogma based on fear and ignorance. the ""beasts"" on the planet and the ""noise"" they made terrified the humans. the preachers referred to these beasts as the work of the devil and condemned any contact with them. typical refrains from the church were:

harken not to the beasts.
death and damnation to the followers of the beasts!
pray for your children, that they follow not the beasts.but a group of men and women known as riders turned their back on the church and partnered up with some of the planet's nighthorses, alien horse-like animals. the riders became a necessary evil to keep the fragile human settlements alive: they supplied and protected the villages and towns. the preachers continued their rhetoric and conveniently forgot that while a rider can survive without a village, a village cannot survive without riders.


== finisterre ==
finisterre is earth-like in many respects with ore-rich mountains, large forests, fertile land and plenty of water. but the comparison ends there: the native fauna, from tiny wally-boos and willy-wisps, to large goblin cats, spook bears and nighthorses are telepathic. the animals project into the surrounding ambient what it is they see and feel. these ""sendings"" are picked up by other animals in the vicinity, alerting them to the presence of friend or foe before they come into view. the animals ""see"" around themselves by monitoring the ambient. but some of the creatures are smart and can camouflage themselves in the ambient. predatory goblin cats can project themselves, for example, as small willy-wisps. others can hide by sending images of themselves being somewhere else. spook bears can send out any image they have ever received and make you believe it is real and happening right now. finisterre was a frightening place for the early settlers.
the colonists encountered many different types of creatures on finisterre, but the small ones were often too numerous and dangerous to catalogue and were referred to generically as ""ghosties"" or ""spooks"".


=== nighthorses ===
nighthorses (so-called because of their jet-black coats) are the largest and most intelligent animals the colonists discovered. they are similar in stature to earth horses, but are omnivorous, have three-toed hooves, are more intelligent than their earth counterparts and are telepathic. nighthorses will eat most things they can catch and kill, but failing that, grass and other vegetation.

when humans first arrived on the planet, the wild nighthorses were immediately drawn to them because of the humans' unconscious sendings that were rich in images and emotion. once a nighthorse has experienced such sendings, it becomes addicted to them and will not leave humans alone. sifting through these human emotions, a nighthorse will eventually select the human whose sendings it likes best and will adopt him or her as its companion. it will follow this person around, and if he or she is in a village or town, it will remain close to the walls and ""call"" by flooding the person with images of itself for days and weeks on end until either that person relents and goes to the horse, or withdraws to the centre of the town (if this is possible) where sendings from the wild generally do not reach.
those who answer a nighthorse's ""call"" become riders. over a short period of time a relationship is formed that is mutually beneficial to both nighthorse and rider: the rider has transport and protection in the wild (a nighthorse will protect its rider to the death), and the nighthorse receives the comforts of the rider camps in the villages, food, the rich emotional human sendings it craves, and ""memory"". on its own, a nighthorse does not have a good memory, but with a rider the ambient is filled with memories and the nighthorse can remember things!
the role of the nighthorse on finisterre is pivotal: without them there would be no riders and without riders the human settlements would vanish.
the range of a typical finisterre creature's sending is ""a stone's throw"", but a ""rogue"" can send much further. a rogue is an animal that is sick or injured and pollutes the ambient with images of its distress. a nighthorse can also go rogue when it loses its rider and sends out desperate longings for companionship. rogue nighthorses are a serious problem to humans on finisterre because they can send their distress over entire valleys and this often spreads to other creatures like a contagion, making their behaviour unpredictable and dangerous. humans are not immune to rogue sendings either. riders and truck drivers have gone over cliff edges because a rogue horse has tricked them into seeing things that are not there. rogue nighthorses have to be tracked down and destroyed.


=== riders ===
a rider does not pick a name for the nighthorse that has adopted him. all nighthorses have an image of how they see themselves and that is the image they will respond to. the rider quickly identifies that image and will always use it to communicate with the horse. danny fisher referred to his nighthorse as ""cloud"" because it saw itself as a cloud drifting peacefully across the sky.
riders and nighthorses communicate with each other, consciously or unconsciously, by sending images. in the novels cherryh depicts such ""sendings"" as text enclosed in ""< >"". for example, <cloud running> is an image sent out by fisher to his nighthorse cloud persuading him to run. a nighthorse anticipating a snow storm may send <cold, frosty breaths, feet crunching snow> to her rider, who in turn will try to calm her horse by sending an image of <melting drops on green needles, sun shining, road free and clear>.
but riders have to be wary of unconscious sendings. almost all thoughts, emotions and anxieties a rider experiences are translated into images and sent to the ambient. nighthorses are easily ""spooked"" and careless human emotion can be destructive. riders therefore have to control their emotions in the presence of nighthorses. in addition, nighthorses generally cannot distinguish between past, present and future: they interpret and act on whatever they pickup literally. so a rider recalling an accident that happened last week will be seen by his horse as happening right now and will take evasive action. riders quickly learn to quieten their minds so as to not excite their horses. riders have to be particularly careful of rogue nighthorses. wanting something intently, for example, a rider-shelter in a storm, can be picked by a rogue and sent back to you, making you believe, sometimes to your peril, that a shelter is right in front of you.
riders don't have complete control over their nighthorses and often have to negotiate with them to get them to do what they want. riders don't saddle or rein their nighthorses (they will not tolerate that). instead, when riding, they will hold onto the horse's mane and, when necessary, clench their knees against the horse's sides.
in the wild a rider is totally dependent on his or her nighthorse for protection against predators and scavengers. riders quickly learn to trust their horse because the horse always knows the wild better than even the most experienced rider. very few animals will approach a nighthorse, and if they do it will broadcast <fierce nighthorse, angry, mayhem> as a warning before attacking. a rider's loyalties are therefore always to his horse first, then his partner, and then his partner's horse.
riders, of course, cannot read each other's thoughts and emotions directly, but they can indirectly if a nighthorse is present. the ""mechanics"" of sendings to and from the ambient on finisterre work as follows:

nighthorses and other local fauna send telepathic images to the ambient.
humans send non-telepathic images to the ambient.
nighthorses and other local fauna can receive both telepathic and non-telepathic images from the ambient.
humans can only receive telepathic images from the ambient.nighthorses generally relay what they receive from the ambient back to the ambient, giving riders in the vicinity access to what other riders are thinking or feeling. while this is useful as it enables riders to communicate quickly with each other without the need for words, it can be problematic when a rider does not want his feelings to be known to others. riders quickly learn how to make themselves ""invisible"" to the ambient by sending images like <wind in the grass, wind bending the stalks, gently waving grass>.
all riders start out as junior riders and their first jobs are often simple tasks like watching over livestock in pastures outside the town walls. senior riders take on more dangerous assignments in the wild, such as escorting truck convoys between towns and villages, and protecting road repair crews. borderers, or border riders, are rider-guides who are born to live in the wild and only come into the villages and towns during the winter months when the mountain passes are closed.


=== settlements ===
the colonists explored and settled in a tract of lowland west of an inland sea and up the east face of the firgeberg, a steep mountain range. three large towns were established in the lowlands: shamesey in east, the largest with over 50,000 people; anveney in the north, an industrial town that refines and processes raw materials; and malvey in the south, another industrial town that drills for natural gas and oil. smaller villages and settlements in the highlands, such as tarmin village, on tarmin height, and evergreen village, halfway up rogers peak, were created for mining and logging activities. evergreen sat at the edge of the known world; the other side of the mountain had never been visited.
every town and village has a rider camp inside its walls for the riders and their nighthorses. generally the rider camp sits between the outer walls of the town and the inner walls surrounding the town proper. large towns like shamesey split the town proper into an outer ring that borders the rider camp for the workers, and an inner ring for the wealthy merchants. these merchants are thus shielded not only from sendings from the wild, but also from sendings from the nighthorses in the rider camps. one notable exception is the industrial town of anveney. it has no rider camp and no protection from riders. the reason for this is that anveney and the surrounding areas are so polluted that no local fauna venture near it.
during the winter months contact between the towns and villages is limited. the winters on finisterre are severe with heavy snow falls making the mountain passes impassable. telephone lines do link the towns and villages, but they are often down due to storm damage. radio communication is not used except in extreme emergencies as it attracts predators and scavengers.

studebaker-packard hawk series,non_science,"the studebaker-packard hawk series were cars produced by the merged studebaker-packard corporation between 1956 and 1964.  all but the 1958 packard hawk were badged studebaker.  described by the company as ""family sports cars"", they were all two-door, four-seat coupes and hardtops. they were an evolution of the long wheelbase (120"") 1953 c/k models designed by robert bourke, lead designer with the raymond loewy agency.  the 1962 redesign as the gt hawk was by another famed stylist, brooks stevens.
the precursor of the hawks was the 1955 studebaker speedster, a special edition hardtop based on the studebaker president with stainless steel trim above the rear window, usually fog lights on the front bumper, deluxe leather interior, a special dash and unique two tone paint combinations. the success of the speedster led to the expanded line of 1956 hawks as a competitor to the ford thunderbird and the oldsmobile starfire.

the four-model hawk range launched in 1956, mirrored the engine and trim levels of the sedans.  there were two coupes; the flight hawk was a base model powered by champion's obsolete and underpowered flathead straight-6 enlarged to 185.6""; the power hawk used studebaker's mid-level ohv 259"" with either 180 hp (130 kw) 2-bbl or 195 hp (145 kw) with a 4-bbl in (4.7 l) v8 from the commander; there were two hardtops; the sky hawk shared the larger ohv 289 in³ v8 and luxury trim with the studebaker president and studebaker golden hawk, however, stood at the top of the range. the golden hawk, fitted with packard's powerful big-block 352 cubic inch 275 hp (5.8 l) v8, was the best all-around high performance car of 1956.  some feel by installing the largest v8 in the smallest lightest body, studebaker created the first muscle car eight years before the gto.  it had the second highest power-to-weight ratio of any american production car.  contemporary road tests verified the golden hawk was faster/quicker in the 1/4 mile than the corvette, thunderbird and chrysler 300b.  in top speed, only the chrysler 300b could equal it.
by 1956, studebaker-packard's financial condition had deteriorated to the point where there was no choice but to discontinue all manufacturing in the packard facilities.  packard's detroit factory and utica proving grounds were closed. in a stop-gap effort to buy time for the development and financing of an all-new packard, and to honor existing dealer contracts, a 1957 packard that was merely a dressed up studebaker president went into production at studebaker's factory in south bend. as packard's v8 was no longer being produced, the new packard as well as the 1957 golden hawk were fitted with studebaker's largest 289 in³ v8, equipped with a mcculloch supercharger to produce the same 275 hp (205 kw) rated power output as the 1956 packard v8.  the range was simplified; the sky hawk was discontinued as too close to the golden hawk, while the two lowest models were replaced with a single silver hawk model, available with either the champion straight-6 or 259 cubic inch (4.2 l) v8.  1958 saw a restyled and re-badged luxury version of the golden hawk sold as the packard hawk.  
studebaker sales continued a rapid decline in 1957-58, so for 1959 studebaker-packard discontinued the hardtop golden hawk, all packards, and the studebaker sedans; the silver hawk coupe was the only holdover left alongside the new studebaker lark range.  it was a make-or-break year, but studebaker's big gamble paid off; the smaller-appearing lark was actually just the six-year-old sedans with a shorter wheelbase and abbreviated front and rear sheetmetal, but it was in the right place at the right time, a car the market wanted.  the silver hawk served as a useful showroom draw, and it was continued; since it was the only hawk model left, it was renamed simply the studebaker hawk and continued under that name through the end of 1961.
for the 1962 model year, brooks stevens restyled the gt hawk and it was launched as the gran turismo hawk.  its styling was well received, and sold relatively well for 1962.  by 1963, studebaker sales were in an irreversible death spiral. even though the 1964 super hawk, available with an optional r2 supercharged engine, 4-speed transmission, twintraction limited-slip differential, front disc brakes and a sport suspension, was the best hawk ever, production was ended with the rest of studebaker's us production in december 1963."
chain of title,non_science,"a chain of title is the sequence of historical transfers of title to a property. it is a valuable tool to identify and document past owners of a property and serves as a property's historical ownership timeline. the ""chain"" runs from the present owner back to the original owner of the property. in situations where documentation of ownership is important, it is often necessary to reconstruct the chain of title. to facilitate this, a record of title documents may be maintained by a registry office or civil law notary.


== chain of title for real property ==
real estate is one field where the chain of title has considerable significance.  in real estate transactions in the united states, insurance companies issue title insurance based upon the chain of title to the property when it is transferred. title insurance companies sometimes maintain private title plants that track real estate titles in addition to the official records.  in other cases, the chain of title is established by an abstract of title, sometimes, although not always, certified by an attorney.  in the united states, some holders of mortgage debt may be unable to establish chain of title, despite the fact that clear chain of title can be required by the mortgage holder before foreclosure can proceed.  widespread lack of clarity in chain of title results from a 1995 decision by many lenders to rely on a third entity—often, a specific company, mortgage electronic registration systems (mers)--to hold title nominally, in an effort to enable the buying and selling of mortgage liabilities without registration of changes of ownership with local governments.  us states have objected and even sued over this practice.


== chain of title for copyrights, trademarks, and rights of publicity ==
in the motion picture industry, the chain of title involves the series of documentation which establishes proprietary rights in a film. the chain also applies to compilations in other fields, where many people have contributed to the project, thus acquiring authorship rights, or where materials were culled from many sources. chain of title is extremely important to film purchasers and to film distributors, as it establishes the veracity of the owner's proprietary rights (or rights under license) in the intellectual property in a film, book or encyclopedia.
chain of title documentation can include:

copyright clearances on music from the regional collecting society, and to a less common extent, footage of other films;
trademark clearances;
talent agreements, which should incorporate a legal release from the talent, be they actors (including crowds), directors, cinematographers, choreographers, or others, to use their works, images, likeness and other personality rights in the film;
proof of errors and omission insurance (a special form of insurance for motion picture producers which covers omissions in obtaining adequate chain of title).specialist organizations engage in the production of copyright property reports for motion picture studios, which cover original or unexploited works, and include the results of united states copyright office screening searches, author claimant searches, registration renewal searches and assignment searches. this involves reviewing us copyright office records from 1870 to present and numerous trade publications and databases, and library of congress records.

basophilic erythroblast,cell,"a proerythroblast (or rubriblast, or pronormoblast) is the earliest of four stages in development of the normoblast.
in histology, it is very difficult to distinguish it from the other ""-blast"" cells (lymphoblast, myeloblast, monoblast, and megakaryoblast). the cytoplasm is blue in an h&e stain, indicating that it is basophilic.
proerythroblasts arise from the cfu-e (colony-forming unit erythroid) cells, and give rise to basophilic erythroblasts. in the mouse, proerythroblasts are large committed progenitors that express high levels of transferrin receptor (iron acquisition receptor), the erythropoietin receptor (epor), some c-kit (stem cell factor receptor), and are ter119 (cell surface molecule)-positive. their proliferative capacity is more limited compared to the preceding stage, the cfu-e.
in vivo, starting with the proerythroblast stage, erythroid cells undergo several more cell divisions while at the same time upregulating survival genes such as bcl-xl, acquiring and storing large amounts of iron, ramping up the synthesis of hemoglobin and other erythroid genes (in large part a gata-1 dependent process that is augmented by the epor signaling) and decreasing in cell size, eventually removing their nuclei and being released into the bloodstream as a reticulocyte. there are several nucleoli on the nucleus and it occupies most of the cell volume. the chromatins are consist of a network of fine red pink strands. the distinguished feature of pro erythroblast to its corresponding myeloblast in granulocytic series is that it carries more basophilic peripheral cytoplasm.


== ""pronormoblast"" vs. ""proerythroblast"" ==
some sources consider the terms ""pronormoblast"" and ""proerythroblast"" to be synonyms. however, other sources consider ""proerythroblast"" to be a parent term, divided into the following two categories:

""pronormoblast"" - normal development
""promegaloblast"" - abnormal development

lim/homeobox protein lhx6 (human),protein,"a homeobox is a dna sequence, around 180 base pairs long, found within genes that are involved in the regulation of patterns of anatomical development (morphogenesis) in animals, fungi, plants, and numerous single cell eukaryotes. homeobox genes encode homeodomain protein products that are transcription factors sharing a characteristic protein fold structure that binds dna to regulate expression of target genes.  homeodomain proteins regulate gene expression and cell differentiation during early embryonic development, thus mutations in homeobox genes can cause developmental disorders.homeosis is a term coined by william bateson to describe the outright replacement of a discrete body part with another body part, e.g. antennapedia—replacement of the antenna on the head of a fruit fly with legs. the ""homeo-"" prefix in the words ""homeobox"" and ""homeodomain"" stems from this mutational phenotype, which is observed when some of these genes are mutated in animals. the homeobox domain was first identified in a number of drosophila homeotic and segmentation proteins, but is now known to be well-conserved in many other animals, including vertebrates.


== discovery ==

the existence of homeobox genes was first discovered in drosophila by isolating the gene responsible for a homeotic transformation where legs grow from the head instead of the expected antennae. walter gehring identified a gene called antennapedia that caused this homeotic phenotype. analysis of antennapedia revealed that this gene contained a 180 base pair sequence that encoded a dna binding domain, which william mcginnis termed the ""homeobox"". the existence of additional drosophila genes containing the antennapedia homeobox sequence was independently reported by ernst hafen, michael levine, william mcginnis, and walter jakob gehring of the university of basel in switzerland and matthew p. scott and amy weiner of indiana university in bloomington in 1984. isolation of homologous genes by edward de robertis and william mcginnis revealed that numerous genes from a variety of species contained the homeobox. subsequent phylogenetic studies detailing the evolutionary relationship between homeobox-containing genes showed that these genes are present in all bilaterian animals.


== homeodomain structure ==
the characteristic homeodomain protein fold consists of a 60-amino acid long domain composed of three alpha helixes. the following shows the consensus homeodomain (~60 amino acid chain):
            helix 1          helix 2         helix 3/4

helix 2 and helix 3 form a so-called helix-turn-helix (hth) structure, where the two alpha helices are connected by a short loop region. the n-terminal two helices of the homeodomain are antiparallel and the longer c-terminal helix is roughly perpendicular to the axes established by the first two. it is this third helix that interacts directly with dna via a number of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, as well as indirect interactions via water molecules, which occur between specific side chains and the exposed bases within the major groove of the dna.homeodomain proteins are found in eukaryotes. through the hth motif, they share limited sequence similarity and structural similarity to  prokaryotic transcription factors, such as lambda phage proteins that alter the expression of genes in prokaryotes. the hth motif shows some sequence similarity but a similar structure in a wide range of dna-binding proteins (e.g., cro and repressor proteins, homeodomain proteins, etc.). one of the principal differences between hth motifs in these different proteins arises from the stereochemical requirement for glycine in the turn which is needed to avoid steric interference of the beta-carbon with the main chain: for cro and repressor proteins the glycine appears to be mandatory, whereas for many of the homeotic and other dna-binding proteins the requirement is relaxed.


=== sequence specificity ===
homeodomains can bind both specifically and nonspecifically to b-dna with the c-terminal recognition helix aligning in the dna's major groove and the unstructured peptide ""tail"" at the n-terminus aligning in the minor groove. the recognition helix and the inter-helix loops are rich in arginine and lysine residues, which form hydrogen bonds to the dna backbone. conserved hydrophobic residues in the center of the recognition helix aid in stabilizing the helix packing. homeodomain proteins show a preference for the dna sequence 5'-taat-3'; sequence-independent binding occurs with significantly lower affinity. the specificity of a single homeodomain protein is usually not enough to recognize specific target gene promoters, making cofactor binding an important mechanism for controlling binding sequence specificity and target gene expression. to achieve higher target specificity, homeodomain proteins form complexes with other transcription factors to recognize the promoter region of a specific target gene. 


== biological function ==
homeodomain proteins function as transcription factors due to the dna binding properties of the conserved hth motif. homeodomain proteins are considered to be master control genes, meaning that a single protein can regulate expression of many target genes. homeodomain proteins direct the formation of the body axes and body structures during early embryonic development. many homeodomain proteins induce cellular differentiation by initiating the cascades of coregulated genes required to produce individual tissues and organs. other proteins in the family, such as nanog are involved in maintaining pluripotency and preventing cell differentiation.   


== regulation ==
hox genes and their associated micrornas are highly conserved developmental master regulators with tight tissue-specific, spatiotemporal control. these genes are known to be dysregulated in several cancers and are often controlled by dna methylation. the regulation of hox genes is highly complex and involves reciprocal interactions, mostly inhibitory. drosophila is known to use the polycomb and trithorax complexes to maintain the expression of hox genes after the down-regulation of the pair-rule and gap genes that occurs during larval development. polycomb-group proteins can silence the hox genes by modulation of chromatin structure.


== mutations ==
mutations to homeobox genes can produce easily visible phenotypic changes in body segment identity, such as the antennapedia and bithorax mutant phenotypes in drosophila. duplication of homeobox genes can produce new body segments, and such duplications are likely to have been important in the evolution of segmented animals.  


== evolution ==
the homeobox itself may have evolved from a non-dna-binding transmembrane domain at the c-terminus of the mray enzyme. this is based on metagenomic data acquired from the transitional archaeon, lokiarchaeum, that is regarded as the prokaryote closest to the ancestor of all eukaryotes.phylogenetic analysis of homeobox gene sequences and homeodomain protein structures suggests that the last common ancestor of plants, fungi, and animals had at least two homeobox genes. molecular evidence shows that some limited number of hox genes have existed in the cnidaria since before the earliest true bilatera, making these genes pre-paleozoic. it is accepted that the three major animal antp-class clusters, hox, parahox, and nk (metahox), are the result of segmental duplications. a first duplication created metahox and protohox, the latter of which later duplicated into hox and parahox. the clusters themselves were created by tandem duplications of a single antp-class homeobox gene. gene duplication followed by neofunctionalization is responsible for the many homeobox genes found in eukaryotes. comparison of homeobox genes and gene clusters has been used to understand the evolution of genome structure and body morphology throughout metazoans.


== types of homeobox genes ==


=== hox genes ===

hox genes are the most commonly known subset of homeobox genes. they are essential metazoan genes that determine the identity of embryonic regions along the anterior-posterior axis.  the first vertebrate hox gene was isolated in xenopus by edward de robertis and colleagues in 1984. the main interest in this set of genes stems from their unique behavior and arrangement in the genome. hox genes are typically found in an organized cluster. the linear order of hox genes within a cluster is directly correlated to the order they are expressed in both time and space during development. this phenomenon is called colinearity. 
mutations in these homeotic genes cause displacement of body segments during embryonic development. this is called ectopia. for example, when one gene is lost the segment develops into a more anterior one, while a mutation that leads to a gain of function causes a segment to develop into a more posterior one. famous examples are antennapedia and bithorax in drosophila, which can cause the development of legs instead of antennae and the development of a duplicated thorax, respectively.in vertebrates, the four paralog clusters are partially redundant in function, but have also acquired several derived functions. for example, hoxa and hoxd specify segment identity along the limb axis. specific members of the hox family have been implicated in vascular remodeling, angiogenesis, and disease by orchestrating changes in matrix degradation, integrins, and components of the ecm. hoxa5 is implicated in atherosclerosis. hoxd3 and hoxb3 are proinvasive, angiogenic genes that upregulate b3 and a5 integrins and efna1 in ecs, respectively. hoxa3 induces endothelial cell (ec) migration by upregulating mmp14 and upar. conversely, hoxd10 and hoxa5 have the opposite effect of suppressing ec migration and angiogenesis, and stabilizing adherens junctions by upregulating timp1/downregulating upar and mmp14, and by upregulating tsp2/downregulating vegfr2, efna1, hif1alpha and cox-2, respectively. hoxa5 also upregulates the tumor suppressor p53 and akt1 by downregulation of pten. suppression of hoxa5 has been shown to attenuate hemangioma growth. hoxa5 has far-reaching effects on gene expression, causing ~300 genes to become upregulated upon its induction in breast cancer cell lines. hoxa5 protein transduction domain overexpression prevents inflammation shown by inhibition of tnfalpha-inducible monocyte binding to huvecs.


=== lim genes ===

lim genes (named after the initial letters of the names of three proteins where the characteristic domain was first identified) encode two 60 amino acid cysteine and histidine-rich lim domains and a homeodomain. the lim domains function in protein-protein interactions and can bind zinc molecules. lim domain proteins are found in both the cytosol and the nucleus. they function in cytoskeletal remodeling, at focal adhesion sites, as scaffolds for protein complexes, and as transcription factors.


=== pax genes ===

most pax genes contain a homeobox and a paired domain that also binds dna to increase binding specificity, though some pax genes have lost all or part of the homeobox sequence. pax genes function in embryo segmentation, nervous system development, generation of the frontal eye fields, skeletal development, and formation of face structures. pax 6 is a master regulator of eye development, such that the gene is necessary for development of the optic vesicle and subsequent eye structures.


=== pou genes ===

proteins containing a pou region consist of a homeodomain and a separate, structurally homologous pou domain that contains two helix-turn-helix motifs and also binds dna. the two domains are linked by a flexible loop that is long enough to stretch around the dna helix, allowing the two domains to bind on opposite sides of the target dna, collectively covering an eight-base segment with consensus sequence 5'-atgcaaat-3'. the individual domains of pou proteins bind dna only weakly, but have strong sequence-specific affinity when linked. the pou domain itself has significant structural similarity with repressors expressed in bacteriophages, particularly lambda phage.


== plant homeobox genes ==
as in animals, the plant homeobox genes code for the typical 60 amino acid long dna-binding homeodomain or in case of the tale (three amino acid loop extension) homeobox genes for an atypical homeodomain consisting of 63 amino acids. according to their conserved intron–exon structure and to unique codomain architectures they have been grouped into 14 distinct classes: hd-zip i to iv, bel, knox, plinc, wox, phd, ddt, ndx, ld, sawadee and pintox. conservation of codomains suggests a common eukaryotic ancestry for tale and non-tale homeodomain proteins.


== human homeobox genes ==
the hox genes in humans are organized in four chromosomal clusters:

parahox genes are analogously found in four areas. they include cdx1, cdx2, cdx4; gsx1, gsx2; and pdx1. other genes considered hox-like include evx1, evx2; gbx1, gbx2; meox1, meox2; and mnx1. the nk-like (nkl) genes, some of which are considered ""metahox"", are grouped with hox-like genes into a large antp-like group.humans have a ""distal-less homeobox"" family: dlx1, dlx2, dlx3, dlx4, dlx5, and dlx6. dlx genes are involved in the development of the nervous system and of limbs. they are considered a subset of the nk-like genes.human tale (three amino acid loop extension) homeobox genes for an ""atypical"" homeodomain consist of 63 rather than 60 amino acids:
irx1, irx2, irx3, irx4, irx5, irx6; meis1, meis2, meis3; mkx; pbx1, pbx2, pbx3, pbx4; pknox1, pknox2; tgif1, tgif2, tgif2lx, tgif2ly.in addition, humans have the following homeobox genes and proteins:

hemagglutinin subtype h7 (influenza a virus),protein,"in virology, influenza a virus subtype h1n1 (a/h1n1) is a subtype of influenza a virus. well known outbreaks of h1n1 strains in humans include the 2009 swine flu pandemic, the 1977 russian flu pandemic as well as the 1918 flu pandemic. it is an orthomyxovirus that contains the glycoproteins haemagglutinin and neuraminidase. for this reason, they are described as h1n1, h1n2 etc. depending on the type of h or n  antigens they express with metabolic synergy. hemagglutinin causes red blood cells to clump together and binds the virus to the infected cell. neuraminidase is a type of glycoside hydrolase enzyme which helps to move the virus particles through the infected cell and assist in budding from the host cells.some strains of h1n1 are endemic in humans and cause a small fraction of all influenza-like illness and a small fraction of all seasonal influenza, for instance in 2004–2005.  other strains of h1n1 are endemic in pigs (swine influenza) and in birds (avian influenza). its size is 80 to 120 nm in diameter.


== swine influenza ==
swine influenza (also known as swine flu or pig flu) is a respiratory disease that occurs in pigs that is caused by the influenza a virus. influenza viruses that are normally found in swine are known as swine influenza viruses (sivs).
the known siv strains include influenza c and the subtypes of influenza a known as h1n1, h1n2, h3n1, h3n2 and h2n3. pigs can also become infected with the h4n6 and h9n2 subtypes.swine influenza virus is common throughout pig populations worldwide. transmission of the virus from pigs to humans is not common and does not always lead to human influenza, often resulting only in the production of antibodies in the blood. if transmission does cause human influenza, it is called zoonotic swine flu or a variant virus. people with regular exposure to pigs are at increased risk of swine flu infection. properly cooking the meat of an infected animal removes the risk of infection.
pigs experimentally infected with the strain of swine flu that caused the human pandemic of 2009–10 showed clinical signs of flu within four days, and the virus spread to other uninfected pigs housed with the infected ones.


== notable incidents ==


=== 1918–1919 spanish flu ===

the spanish flu was an unusually severe and deadly strain of h1n1 avian influenza, a viral infectious disease, that killed some 17 to 50 or more million people worldwide over about a year in 1918 and 1919. it was one of the deadliest pandemics in human history.

the 1918 flu caused an abnormally high number of deaths, possibly due to it provoking a cytokine storm in the body. (the current h5n1 bird flu, also an influenza a virus, has a similar effect.) after the spanish flu infected lung cells it frequently led to overstimulation of the immune system via release of cytokines (a protein that invokes the immune response) into the lung tissue. this leads to extensive leukocyte migration towards the lungs, resulting in the destruction of lung cells and secretion of blood and mucus into the alveoli and airways. this makes it difficult for the patient to breathe and can result in suffocation. in contrast to other pandemics, which mostly kill the old and the very young, the 1918 pandemic killed unusual numbers of young adults, which may have been due to their healthy immune systems mounting a too-strong and damaging response to the infection.the term ""spanish"" flu was coined because spain was at the time the only european country where the press were printing reports of the outbreak, which had killed thousands in the armies fighting world war i (1914–1918). other countries suppressed the news in order to protect morale.


=== 1976 swine flu outbreak ===

in 1976, a novel swine influenza a (h1n1) caused severe respiratory illness in 13 soldiers, with one death at fort dix, new jersey. the virus was detected only from 19 january to 9 february and did not spread beyond fort dix. retrospective serologic testing subsequently demonstrated that up to 230 soldiers had been infected with the novel virus, which was an h1n1 strain. the cause of the outbreak is still unknown and no exposure to pigs was identified.


=== 1977 russian flu ===

the 1977 russian flu pandemic was caused by strain influenza a/ussr/90/77 (h1n1). it infected mostly children and young adults under 23; because a similar strain was prevalent in 1947–57, most adults had substantial immunity. because of a striking similarity in the viral rna of the two strains – one which is unlikely to appear in nature due to antigenic drift – it was speculated that the later outbreak was due to a laboratory incident in russia or northern china, though this was denied by scientists in those countries. later analysis found that the re-emergent strain had been circulating for approximately one year before it was detected in china and russia.
the virus was included in the 1978–79 influenza vaccine.


=== 2009 a(h1n1) pandemic ===

in the 2009 flu pandemic, the virus isolated from patients in the united states was found to be made up of genetic elements from four different flu viruses – north american swine influenza, north american avian influenza, human influenza, and swine influenza virus typically found in asia and europe – ""an unusually mongrelised mix of genetic sequences."" this new strain appears to be a result of reassortment of human influenza and swine influenza viruses, in all four different strains of subtype h1n1.
preliminary genetic characterization found that the hemagglutinin (ha) gene was similar to that of swine flu viruses present in u.s. pigs since 1999, but the neuraminidase (na) and matrix protein (m) genes resembled versions present in european swine flu isolates. the six genes from american swine flu are themselves mixtures of swine flu, bird flu, and human flu viruses. while viruses with this genetic makeup had not previously been found to be circulating in humans or pigs, there is no formal national surveillance system to determine what viruses are circulating in pigs in the u.s.in april 2009, an outbreak of influenza-like illness (ili) occurred in mexico and then in the united states; the cdc reported seven cases of novel a/h1n1 influenza and promptly shared the genetic sequences on the gisaid database. with similar timely sharing of data for mexican isolates, by 24 april it became clear that the outbreak of ili in mexico and the confirmed cases of novel influenza a in the southwest us were related and who issued a health advisory on the outbreak of ""influenza-like illness in the united states and mexico"".
the disease then spread very rapidly, with the number of confirmed cases rising to 2,099 by 7 may, despite aggressive measures taken by the mexican government to curb the spread of the disease.  the outbreak had been predicted a year earlier by noticing the increasing number of replikins, a type of peptide, found in the virus.on 11 june 2009, the who declared an h1n1 pandemic, moving the alert level to phase 6, marking the first global pandemic since the 1968 hong kong flu. on 25 october 2009, u.s. president barack obama officially declared h1n1 a national emergency. the president's declaration caused many u.s. employers to take actions to help stem the spread of the swine flu and to accommodate employees and / or workflow which may have been impacted by an outbreak.a study conducted in coordination with the university of michigan health service – scheduled for publication in the december 2009 american journal of roentgenology – warned that h1n1 flu can cause pulmonary embolism, surmised as a leading cause of death in this pandemic. the study authors suggest physician evaluation via contrast enhanced ct scans for the presence of pulmonary emboli when caring for patients diagnosed with respiratory complications from a ""severe"" case of the h1n1 flu. however pulmonary embolism is not the only embolic manifestation of h1n1 infection. h1n1 may induce a number of embolic events such as myocardial infarction, bilateral massive dvt, arterial thrombus of infrarenal aorta, thrombosis of right external iliac vein and common femoral vein or cerebral gas embolism. the type of embolic events caused by h1n1 infection are summarized in a 2010 review by dimitroulis ioannis et al.the 21 march 2010 worldwide update, by the u.n.'s world health organization (who), states that ""213 countries and overseas territories/communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza h1n1 2009, including at least 16,931 deaths."" as of 30 may 2010, worldwide update by world health organization (who) more than 214 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza h1n1 2009, including over 18,138 deaths. the research team of andrew miller showed pregnant patients are at increased risk. it has been suggested that pregnant women and certain populations such as native north americans have a greater likelihood of developing a t helper type 2 response to h1n1 influenza which may be responsible for the systemic inflammatory response syndrome that causes pulmonary edema and death.on 26 april 2011, an h1n1 pandemic preparedness alert was issued by the world health organization for the americas. in august 2011, according to the u.s. geological survey and the cdc, northern sea otters off the coast of washington state were infected with the same version of the h1n1 flu virus that caused the 2009 pandemic and ""may be a newly identified animal host of influenza viruses"". in may 2013, seventeen people died during an h1n1 outbreak in venezuela, and a further 250 were infected. as of early january 2014, texas health officials have confirmed at least thirty-three h1n1 deaths and widespread outbreak during the 2013/2014 flu season, while twenty-one more deaths have been reported across the us. nine people have been reported dead from an outbreak in several canadian cities, and mexico reports outbreaks resulting in at least one death. spanish health authorities have confirmed 35 h1n1 cases in the aragon region, 18 of whom are in intensive care. on 17 march 2014, three cases were confirmed with a possible fourth awaiting results occurring at the centre for addiction and mental health in toronto, ontario, canada.


=== 2012 india outbreak ===
with more than 300 infections and over 20 deaths, india's health ministry declared an outbreak ""well under control"" with ""no reason to panic"" in april 2012.


=== 2015 india outbreak ===

according to the indian health ministry, 31,974 cases of swine flu had been reported and 1,895 people had died from an outbreak by mid-march.


=== 2017 maldives outbreak ===
maldives reported swine flu in early 2017; 501 people were tested for the disease and 185 (37%) of those tested were positive for the disease. four of those who tested positive from these 185 died due to this disease.the total number of people who have died due to the disease is unknown. patient zero was never identified.schools were closed for a week due to the disease, but were ordered by the ministry of education to open after the holidays even though the disease was not fully under control.after widespread rumors about saudi arabia going to purchase an entire atoll from maldives, the saudi arabian embassy in maldives issued a statement dismissing the rumors. however, the trip of the saudi monarch was going forward until it was cancelled later due to the h1n1 outbreak in maldives.


=== 2017 myanmar outbreak ===
myanmar reported h1n1 in late july 2017. as of 27 july, there were 30 confirmed cases and six people had died. the ministry of health and sports of myanmar sent an official request to who to provide help to control the virus; and also mentioned that the government would be seeking international assistance, including from the un, china and the united states.


=== 2017–18 pakistan outbreak ===
pakistan reported h1n1 cases mostly arising from the city of multan, with deaths resulting from the epidemic reaching 42. there have also been confirmed cases in cities of gujranwala and lahore.


=== 2019 malta outbreak ===
an outbreak of swine flu in the european union member state was reported in mid-january 2019, with the island's main state hospital overcrowded within a week, with more than 30 cases being treated.


=== 2019 morocco outbreak ===
in january 2019 an outbreak of h1n1 was recorded in morocco, with nine confirmed fatalities. as of 4 february, 11 deaths have been reported in various regions of morocco.


=== 2019 iran outbreak ===
in november 2019 an outbreak of h1n1 was recorded in iran, with 56 fatalities and 4,000 people hospitalized.


=== g4 virus ===
the g4 virus, also known as the ""g4 swine flu virus"" (g4) and ""g4 ea h1n1"", is a swine influenza virus strain discovered in china. the virus is a variant genotype 4 (g4) eurasian avian-like (ea) h1n1 virus that mainly affects pigs, but there is some evidence of it infecting people. a 2020 peer-reviewed paper from the  proceedings of the national academy of sciences (pnas) stated that ""g4 ea h1n1 viruses possess all the essential hallmarks of being highly adapted to infect humans ... controlling the prevailing g4 ea h1n1 viruses in pigs and close monitoring of swine working populations should be promptly implemented.""michael ryan, executive director of the world health organization (who) health emergencies program, stated in july 2020 that this strain of influenza virus was not new and had been under surveillance since 2011. the chinese cdc said it had implemented an influenza surveillance program in 2010, analyzing more than 400,000 tests annually, to facilitate early identification of influenza. of those, 13 a(h1n1) cases were detected, of which three were of the g4 variant.the study stated that almost 30,000 swine had been monitored via nasal swabs between 2011 and 2018. while other variants of the virus have appeared and diminished, the study claimed the g4 variant had sharply increased since 2016 to become the predominant strain. the chinese ministry of agriculture and rural affairs rebutted the study, saying that the number of pigs sampled was too small to demonstrate g4 had become the dominant strain and that the media had interpreted the study ""in an exaggerated and nonfactual way"". they also said the infected workers ""did not show flu symptoms and the test sample is not representative of the pig population in china"".according to the study, between 2016 and 2018, 338 swine production workers in china were tested for antibodies of the virus, and 35 (10.4%) had tested positive. of those workers between the ages of 18 and 35, 20.5% had tested positive. among another 230 people screened who did not work in the swine industry, 10 (4.4%) tested positive for antibodies, indicating prior infection. three cases of infection caused by the g4 virus had been documented as of july 2020, with no confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission.the us centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) said the study suggested that human infection by the g4 virus is more common than it was thought to be. both the european centre for disease prevention and control (ecdc) and the us cdc stated that, like all flu viruses with pandemic potential, the variant is a concern that will be monitored. the ecdc stated that ""the most important intervention in preparing for the pandemic potential of influenza viruses is the development and use of human vaccines ..."". health officials (including anthony fauci) have said that the virus should be monitored, particularly among those in close contact with pigs, but it is not an immediate threat. while there have been no reported cases or evidence of the virus outside china as of july 2020, smithsonian magazine reported in july 2020 that scientists agree that the virus should be closely monitored, but because it ""so far cannot jump from person to person"", it should not be a cause for alarm yet.


== in pregnancy ==
pregnant women who contract the h1n1 infection are at a greater risk of developing complications because of hormonal changes, physical changes and changes to their immune system to accommodate the growing fetus.  for this reason the center for disease control and prevention recommends that those who are pregnant get vaccinated to prevent the influenza virus. the vaccination should not be taken by people who have had a severe allergic reaction to the influenza vaccination. additionally those who are moderately to severely ill, with or without a fever should wait until they recover before taking the vaccination.pregnant women who become infected with the influenza are advised to contact their doctor immediately. influenza can be treated using antiviral medication, which are available by prescription. oseltamivir (trade name tamiflu) and zanamivir (relenza) are two neuraminidase inhibitors (antiviral medications) currently recommended. it has been shown that they are most effective when taken within two days of becoming sick.since 1 october 2008, the cdc has tested 1,146 seasonal influenza a (h1n1) viruses for resistance against oseltamivir and zanamivir. it was found that 99.6% of the samples were resistant to oseltamivir while none were resistant to zanamivir. however, when 2009 influenza a (h1n1) virus samples were tested, only 4% (of 853 samples) showed resistance to oseltamivir (again, no samples showed resistance to zanamivir).  a study conducted in japan during the 2009 h1n1 pandemic concluded that infants exposed to either oseltamivir or zanamivir had no short term adverse effects.  both amantadine and rimantadine have been found to be teratogenic and embryotoxic (malformations and toxic effects on the embryo) when given at high doses in animal studies.

cis-vaccenate(1-),reagent,"vaccenic acid is a naturally occurring trans fatty acid. it is the predominant kind of trans-fatty acid found in human milk, in the fat of ruminants, and in dairy products such as milk, butter, and yogurt.
trans fat in human milk may depend on trans fat content in food.its iupac name is (11e)-11-octadecenoic acid, and its lipid shorthand name is 18:1 trans-11.  the name was derived from the latin vacca (cow).vaccenic acid was discovered in 1928 in animal fats and butter.  
mammals convert it into rumenic acid, a conjugated linoleic acid,
where it shows anticarcinogenic properties.its stereoisomer, cis-vaccenic acid, is an omega-7 fatty acid, is found in sea buckthorn (hippophae rhamnoides) oil.  its iupac name is (11z)-11-octadecenoic acid, and its lipid shorthand name is 18:1 cis-11.

voriconazole injection,drug,"voriconazole, sold under the brand name vfend among others, is an antifungal medication used to treat a number of fungal infections. this includes aspergillosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, penicilliosis, and infections by scedosporium or fusarium. it can be taken by mouth or used by injection into a vein.common side effects include vision problems, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, headache, and seeing or hearing things that are not present. use during pregnancy may result in harm to the baby. it is in the triazole family of medications. it works by affecting fungal metabolism and fungal cell membranes.voriconazole was patented in 1990 and approved for medical use in the united states in 2002. it is on the world health organization's list of essential medicines.


== medical uses ==
voriconazole is used to treat invasive aspergillosis and candidiasis and fungal infections caused by scedosporium and fusarium species, which may occur in immunocompromised patients, including people undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplant (bmt), who have  hematologic cancers or who undergo organ transplants.it is also used to prevent fungal infection in people as they undergo bmt.it is also the recommended treatment for the cns fungal infections transmitted by epidural injection of contaminated steroids.it can be taken by mouth or given in a doctor's office or clinic by intravenous infusion.


== contraindications ==
it is toxic to the fetus; pregnant women should not take it and women taking it should not become pregnant.people who have hereditary intolerance for galactose,  lapp lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this drug.  it should be used with caution in people with arrhythmias or long qt.no dose adjustment is necessary for renal impairment or advanced age, but children seem to clear voriconazole faster than adults and drug levels may need monitoring.


== side effects ==
the labels carry several warnings of the risk of injection site reactions, hypersensitivity reactions; kidney, liver, and pancreas damage; trouble with vision; and adverse effects in skin including damage due to phototoxicity, squamous cell skin cancer, and stevens–johnson syndrome; in long-term use there is a warning of the risk of bone fluorosis and periostitis.additionally, very common adverse effects, occurring in more than 10% of people, include peripheral edema, headaches, trouble breathing, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, nausea, rashes, and fever.common adverse effects, occurring in between 1 and 10% of people, include sinus infections, low numbers of white and red blood cells (agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and anemia), low blood sugar, reduced amount of potassium and sodium, depression, hallucinations, anxiety, insomnia, agitation, confusion, convulsions, fainting, tremor, weakness, tingling, sleepiness, dizziness, bleeding retina, irregular heart beats, slow or fast heart beats, low blood pressure, inflamed veins, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary edema, inflamed lips, swollen face, stomach upset, constipation, gingivitis, jaundice, hair loss, flaky skin, itchiness, red skin, back pain, chest pain, and chills.


== interactions ==
being metabolized by hepatic cytochrome p450, voriconazole interacts with many drugs. voriconazole should not be used in conjunction with many drugs (including sirolimus, rifampicin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, quinidine and ergot alkaloids) and dose adjustments and/or monitoring should be done when coadministered with others (including fluconazole, warfarin, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, omeprazole, and phenytoin). voriconazole may be safely administered with cimetidine, ranitidine, indinavir, macrolide antibiotics, mycophenolate, digoxin and prednisolone.

pussycat and the dirty johnsons,non_science,"pussycat and the dirty johnsons, formerly known as the johnsons, are an english punk rock band fronted by singer puss johnson since 2002 and first formed by guitarist ""dirty"" jake johnson in basingstoke. since 2012, the only other member has been drummer ""filfy"" antz johnson.  the band have achieved press coverage in the basingstoke gazette, music magazine vive le rock who included their track vampire sugar on the free cd with the november 2011 edition (issue 5) and website louder than war.


== history ==
dirty jake and bassist ian fuller first formed the johnsons. in 2002 they were joined by puss johnson together with drummer james sturtridge.  over the course of the 2000s, they released five eps with the second and third eps also featuring harmonica player john mcgarvey.  sturtridge was replaced by filfy antz in time for the fifth ep in 2007. in 2010 mike lalor replaced fuller on bass and the band, now revitalised and under the new name of pussycat and the dirty johnsons, released debut album exercise your demons in 2010.  album track vampire sugar was included on a free cd with issue 5 of vive le rock magazinelalor was sacked from the band in 2012 and since then, puss, dirty jake and filfy antz have played live as a three piece with no bassist.  second album dirty rock n roll was released in 2013. vive le rock awarded the album 9/10, declaring that the album had ""(taken) the elements that made exercise your demons a winner and improving on them ... the twisted humour's still abundant, albeit a tad darker,"" and declared that track hideous was the album's ""coup de grace.""writer ged babey also praised the band and the album on the louder than war website: ""this is a magnificent, homegrown uk punk rock’n’roll album. beg, borrow, steal or buy it. hear it at least and check them out live, that’s all that needs to be said really ...puss has hair sculpted into cats ears, pvc catsuit or leopard print gear, great big boots. she looks as cool as fuck. ok, she takes inspiration from eartha kitt's catwoman, poison ivy and ’77 punkette soo catwoman, but in 2013, there is simply no one else who looks like puss. she stops traffic. she has such style she just had to be the singer in (the) wildest rock’n’roll band in the county ... at their most raging p&tdj’s sound like the slits had they chosen rockabilly over reggae as their musical first love ...  on the one hand they sing about all the usual fantasy splattermovie stuff; shrunken heads, bodies in ditches and bondage, but coming to the surface and at the heart of other songs there is some real underlying pain.""the group received two gushing live reviews from neil duncan in the basingstoke gazette in 2014.  the first, of their january 2014 gig at the irish centre described the band as ""basingstoke punk'n'roll legends"" and reported that the band ""were really tight and professional with a fantastic sound and a great selection of catchy songs. there was plenty of interaction with a delighted crowd and an all round very lively performance."" in july 2014, duncan travelled to brighton to see and review the band's performance at the haunt and again enthused, ""they were a big hit from the word go - it was a fantastic venue, with a good crowd and excellent acoustics. the band themselves were on top form and faced an irresistible cheer for an encore, which they duly obliged.""the band released an ep called dead songs in 2015 which was a collection of song versions recorded at the exercise your demons sessions but not previously released.  third album ain't no pussy was released in 2017. vive le rock scored the album 8/10 with reviewer lee cotterell commenting that the band were ""on feisty form.  the roar of a big cat introduces the title track, a furious stab of garage punk that goes straight for the jugular... all the while dirty jake and filfy antz provide the scuzzy guitar and pounding beats that keep the momentum going.  a strong contender for album of the year.""  fourth album beast was released july 2020 on hound gawd! records based in germany.

bisacodyl rectal suppository,drug,"bisacodyl (inn) is an organic compound that is used as a stimulant laxative drug.  it works directly on the colon to produce a bowel movement. it is typically prescribed for relief of episodic and chronic constipation and for the management of neurogenic bowel dysfunction, as well as part of bowel preparation before medical examinations, such as for a colonoscopy.bisacodyl is a derivative of triphenylmethane. it was first used as a laxative in 1953 because of its structural similarity to phenolphthalein.


== available forms ==
bisacodyl is marketed under the trade names dulcolax/durolax, muxol, fleet, nourilax, alophen, correctol, and carter's little pills (formerly carter's little liver pills), as well as being available generically. it is usually sold as 5 mg tablets, 10 mg suppositories, or 5 mg pediatric suppositories. it is also available as a 1.25 us fluid ounces (37 ml) pre-packaged enema containing a 10 mg delivered dose of liquid bisacodyl.


== administration ==
when bisacodyl is administered orally, it is usually taken at bedtime. oral administration is known to produce no action for more than eight hours and then to work suddenly and relatively quickly. this is especially true if more than 10 mg is taken at one time. normally, the dosage is 5 or 10 mg, but up to 30 mg can be taken for complete cleansing of the bowel before a procedure.
when administered rectally in suppository form, it is usually effective in 15 to 60 minutes. for optimal use, if used as a suppository, it is recommended that bisacodyl be given after breakfast to synchronize with the gastrocolic reflex. two suppositories can be inserted at once if a very strong, purgative, enema-like result is needed. a few hours after the initial evacuation, there can be a secondary action which will continue as long as there is unexpelled bisacodyl present in the rectum.
as a commercially prepared micro-enema, it is usually effective in 5 to 20 minutes.


== mechanism of action ==
bisacodyl works by stimulating enteric neurons to cause peristalsis, i.e., colonic contractions. it is also a contact laxative; it increases fluid and salt secretion. the action of bisacodyl on the small intestine is negligible; stimulant laxatives mainly promote evacuation of the colon.

syntaxin-112 (arabidopsis thaliana),protein,"professor gerd jürgens (also spelt juergens) (born 1949) is a plant developmental biologist currently(as of end 2010) holding the posts of director of the cell biology department at the max planck institute for developmental biology and head of the center for plant molecular biology(zmbp) at the eberhard-karls universität tübingen. he has published extensively in leading journals, including eight papers in the journal nature as well as various articles in the journals cell, science, journal of cell biology and the plant journal.during his postdoctoral years in the 1980s he worked with nobel prize winners christiane nüsslein-volhard and eric wieschaus at the european molecular biology laboratory (embl) in heidelberg on the topic of drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis.
at the age of 37 he made the switch from animal to plant research and became one of the first researchers to work on what was later to become the model plant organism: arabidopsis thaliana.
he was responsible for pioneering research in the genetic dissection of plant embryogenesis. using the genetically-tractable plant arabidopsis thaliana he conducted the first forward genetic screen (using mutagenesis with 0.3% ethyl methane sulfonate (ems)) looking for embryonic defects.
his laboratory discovered and characterized the protein knolle, which is required for cytokinesis and was the first protein known to exclusively target the cell plate in plant cells. 
prof gerd jürgens also worked extensively on the arf-gef gnom. both knolle and gnom were first discovered in his embryonic mutant screens.

single fate stem cell,cell,"embryonic stem cells (es cells or escs) are pluripotent stem cells derived from the inner cell mass of a blastocyst, an early-stage pre-implantation embryo. human embryos reach the blastocyst stage 4–5 days post fertilization, at which time they consist of 50–150 cells. isolating the embryoblast, or inner cell mass (icm) results in destruction of the blastocyst, a process which raises ethical issues, including whether or not embryos at the pre-implantation stage should have the same moral considerations as embryos in the post-implantation stage of development.researchers are currently focusing heavily on the therapeutic potential of embryonic stem cells, with clinical use being the goal for many laboratories. potential uses include the treatment of diabetes and heart disease. the cells are being studied to be used as clinical therapies, models of genetic disorders, and cellular/dna repair. however, adverse effects in the research and clinical processes such as tumours and unwanted immune responses have also been reported.


== properties ==

embryonic stem cells (escs), derived from the blastocyst stage of early mammalian embryos, are distinguished by their ability to differentiate into any embryonic cell type and by their ability to self-renew. it is these traits that makes them valuable in the scientific and medical fields. escs have a normal karyotype, maintain high telomerase activity, and exhibit remarkable long-term proliferative potential.


=== pluripotent ===
embryonic stem cells of the inner cell mass are pluripotent, meaning they are able to differentiate to generate primitive ectoderm, which ultimately differentiates during gastrulation into all derivatives of the three primary germ layers: ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm. these germ layers generate each of the more than 220 cell types in the adult human body. when provided with the appropriate signals, escs initially form precursor cells that in subsequently differentiate into the desired cell types. pluripotency distinguishes embryonic stem cells from adult stem cells, which are multipotent and can only produce a limited number of cell types.


=== self renewal and repair of structure ===
under defined conditions, embryonic stem cells are capable of self-renewing indefinitely in an undifferentiated state. self-renewal conditions must prevent the cells from clumping and maintain an environment that supports an unspecialized state. typically this is done in the lab with media containing serum and leukemia inhibitory factor or serum-free media supplements with two inhibitory drugs (""2i""), the mek inhibitor pd03259010 and gsk-3 inhibitor chir99021.


=== growth ===
escs divide very frequently due to a shortened g1 phase in their cell cycle. rapid cell division allows the cells to quickly grow in number, but not size, which is important for early embryo development. in escs, cyclin a and cyclin e proteins involved in the g1/s transition are always expressed at high levels. cyclin-dependent kinases such as cdk2 that promote cell cycle progression are overactive, in part due to downregulation of their inhibitors. retinoblastoma proteins that inhibit the transcription factor e2f until the cell is ready to enter s phase are hyperphosphorylated and inactivated in escs, leading to continual expression of proliferation genes. these changes result in accelerated cycles of cell division. although the shortened g1 phase has been linked to maintenance of pluripotency, escs grown in serum-free 2i conditions do express hypo-phosphorylated active retinoblastoma proteins and have an elongated g1 phase. despite this difference in the cell cycle when compared to escs grown in media containing serum these cells have similar pluripotent characteristics. pluripotency factors oct4 and nanog play a role in transcriptionally regulating the esc cell cycle.


=== uses ===
due to their plasticity and potentially unlimited capacity for self-renewal, embryonic stem cell therapies have been proposed for regenerative medicine and tissue replacement after injury or disease. pluripotent stem cells have shown promise in treating a number of varying conditions, including but not limited to: spinal cord injuries, age related macular degeneration, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders (such as parkinson's disease), aids, etc. in addition to their potential in regenerative medicine, embryonic stem cells provide a possible alternative source of tissue/organs which serves as a possible solution to the donor shortage dilemma. there are some ethical controversies surrounding this though (see ethical debate section below). aside from these uses, escs can also be used for research on early human development, certain genetic disease, and in vitro toxicology testing.


== utilizations ==
according to a 2002 article in pnas, ""human embryonic stem cells have the potential to differentiate into various cell types, and, thus, may be useful as a source of cells for transplantation or tissue engineering.""

however, embryonic stem cells are not limited to cell/tissue engineering.


=== cell replacement therapies ===
current research focuses on differentiating escs into a variety of cell types for eventual use as cell replacement therapies (crts). some of the cell types that have or are currently being developed include cardiomyocytes (cm), neurons, hepatocytes, bone marrow cells, islet cells and endothelial cells.  however, the derivation of such cell types from escs is not without obstacles, therefore current research is focused on overcoming these barriers. for example, studies are underway to differentiate escs into tissue specific cms and to eradicate their immature properties that distinguish them from adult cms.


=== clinical potential ===
researchers have differentiated escs into dopamine-producing cells with the hope that these neurons could be used in the treatment of parkinson's disease.
escs have been differentiated to natural killer (nk) cells and bone tissue.
studies involving escs are underway to provide an alternative treatment for diabetes. for example, d’amour et al. were able to differentiate escs into insulin producing cells and researchers at harvard university were able to produce large quantities of pancreatic beta cells from es.
an article published in the european heart journal describes a translational process of generating human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiac progenitor cells to be used in clinical trials of patients with severe heart failure.


=== drug discovery ===
besides becoming an important alternative to organ transplants, escs are also being used in field of toxicology and as cellular screens to uncover new chemical entities (nces) that can be developed as small molecule drugs.  studies have shown that cardiomyocytes derived from escs are validated in vitro models to test drug responses and predict toxicity profiles.  es derived cardiomyocytes have been shown to respond to pharmacological stimuli and hence can be used to assess cardiotoxicity like torsades de pointes.esc-derived hepatocytes are also useful models that could be used in the preclinical stages of drug discovery. however, the development of hepatocytes from escs has proven to be challenging and this hinders the ability to test drug metabolism. therefore, current research is focusing on establishing fully functional esc-derived hepatocytes with stable phase i and ii enzyme activity.


=== models of genetic disorder ===
several new studies have started to address the concept of modeling genetic disorders with embryonic stem cells. either by genetically manipulating the cells, or more recently, by deriving diseased cell lines identified by prenatal genetic diagnosis (pgd), modeling genetic disorders is something that has been accomplished with stem cells. this approach may very well prove valuable at studying disorders such as fragile-x syndrome, cystic fibrosis, and other genetic maladies that have no reliable model system.
yury verlinsky, a russian-american medical researcher who specialized in embryo and cellular genetics (genetic cytology), developed prenatal diagnosis testing methods to determine genetic and chromosomal disorders a month and a half earlier than standard amniocentesis. the techniques are now used by many pregnant women and prospective parents, especially couples who have a history of genetic abnormalities or where the woman is over the age of 35 (when the risk of genetically related disorders is higher). in addition, by allowing parents to select an embryo without genetic disorders, they have the potential of saving the lives of siblings that already had similar disorders and diseases using cells from the disease free offspring.


=== repair of dna damage ===
differentiated somatic cells and es cells use different strategies for dealing with dna damage.  for instance, human foreskin fibroblasts, one type of somatic cell, use non-homologous end joining (nhej), an error prone dna repair process, as the primary pathway for repairing double-strand breaks (dsbs) during all cell cycle stages.   because of its error-prone nature, nhej tends to produce mutations in a cell's clonal descendants.
es cells use a different strategy to deal with dsbs.  because es cells give rise to all of the cell types of an organism including the cells of the germ line, mutations arising in es cells due to faulty dna repair are a more serious problem than in differentiated somatic cells. consequently, robust mechanisms are needed in es cells to repair dna damages accurately, and if repair fails, to remove those cells with un-repaired dna damages.  thus, mouse es cells predominantly use high fidelity homologous recombinational repair (hrr) to repair dsbs.  this type of repair depends on the interaction of the two sister chromosomes formed during s phase and present together during the g2 phase of the cell cycle.  hrr can accurately repair dsbs in one sister chromosome by using intact information from the other sister chromosome.  cells in the g1 phase of the cell cycle (i.e. after metaphase/cell division but prior the next round of replication) have only one copy of each chromosome (i.e. sister chromosomes aren't present).  mouse es cells lack a g1 checkpoint and do not undergo cell cycle arrest upon acquiring dna damage.  rather they undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) in response to dna damage.  apoptosis can be used as a fail-safe strategy to remove cells with un-repaired dna damages in order to avoid mutation and progression to cancer.   consistent with this strategy, mouse es stem cells have a mutation frequency about 100-fold lower than that of isogenic mouse somatic cells.


=== clinical trial ===

on january 23, 2009, phase i clinical trials for transplantation of oligodendrocytes (a cell type of the brain and spinal cord) derived from human es cells into spinal cord-injured individuals received approval from the u.s. food and drug administration (fda), marking it the world's first human es cell human trial. the study leading to this scientific advancement was conducted by hans keirstead and colleagues at the university of california, irvine and supported by geron corporation of menlo park, ca, founded by michael d. west, phd. a previous experiment had shown an improvement in locomotor recovery in spinal cord-injured rats after a 7-day delayed transplantation of human es cells that had been pushed into an oligodendrocytic lineage. the phase i clinical study was designed to enroll about eight to ten paraplegics who have had their injuries no longer than two weeks before the trial begins, since the cells must be injected before scar tissue is able to form.  the researchers emphasized that the injections were not expected to fully cure the patients and restore all mobility.  based on the results of the rodent trials, researchers speculated that restoration of myelin sheathes and an increase in mobility might occur.  this first trial was primarily designed to test the safety of these procedures and if everything went well, it was hoped that it would lead to future studies that involve people with more severe disabilities. the trial was put on hold in august 2009 due to fda concerns regarding a small number of microscopic cysts found in several treated rat models but the hold was lifted on july 30, 2010.in october 2010 researchers enrolled and administered ests to the first patient at shepherd center in atlanta.  the makers of the stem cell therapy, geron corporation, estimated that it would take several months for the stem cells to replicate and for the grnopc1 therapy to be evaluated for success or failure.
in november 2011 geron announced it was halting the trial and dropping out of stem cell research for financial reasons, but would continue to monitor existing patients, and was attempting to find a partner that could continue their research. in 2013 biotime, led by ceo dr. michael d. west, acquired all of geron's stem cell assets, with the stated intention of restarting geron's embryonic stem cell-based clinical trial for spinal cord injury research.biotime company asterias biotherapeutics (nyse mkt: ast) was granted a $14.3 million strategic partnership award by the california institute for regenerative medicine (cirm) to re-initiate the world's first embryonic stem cell-based human clinical trial, for spinal cord injury.  supported by california public funds, cirm is the largest funder of stem cell-related research and development in the world.the award provides funding for asterias to reinitiate clinical development of ast-opc1 in subjects with spinal cord injury and to expand clinical testing of escalating doses in the target population intended for future pivotal trials.ast-opc1 is a population of cells derived from human embryonic stem cells (hescs) that contains oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (opcs). opcs and their mature derivatives called oligodendrocytes provide critical functional support for nerve cells in the spinal cord and brain. asterias recently presented the results from phase 1 clinical trial testing of a low dose of ast-opc1 in patients with neurologically-complete thoracic spinal cord injury. the results showed that ast-opc1 was successfully delivered to the injured spinal cord site. patients followed 2–3 years after ast-opc1 administration showed no evidence of serious adverse events associated with the cells in detailed follow-up assessments including frequent neurological exams and mris. immune monitoring of subjects through one year post-transplantation showed no evidence of antibody-based or cellular immune responses to ast-opc1. in four of the five subjects, serial mri scans performed throughout the 2–3 year follow-up period indicate that reduced spinal cord cavitation may have occurred and that ast-opc1 may have had some positive effects in reducing spinal cord tissue deterioration. there was no unexpected neurological degeneration or improvement in the five subjects in the trial as evaluated by the international standards for neurological classification of spinal cord injury (isncsci) exam.the strategic partnership iii grant from cirm will provide funding to asterias to support the next clinical trial of ast-opc1 in subjects with spinal cord injury, and for asterias’ product development efforts to refine and scale manufacturing methods to support later-stage trials and eventually commercialization. cirm funding will be conditional on fda approval for the trial, completion of a definitive agreement between asterias and cirm, and asterias’ continued progress toward the achievement of certain pre-defined project milestones.


== concern and controversy ==


=== adverse effects ===
the major concern with the possible transplantation of esc into patients as therapies is their ability to form tumors including teratoma.  safety issues prompted the fda to place a hold on the first esc clinical trial, however no tumors were observed.
the main strategy to enhance the safety of esc for potential clinical use is to differentiate the esc into specific cell types (e.g. neurons, muscle, liver cells) that have reduced or eliminated ability to cause tumors. following differentiation, the cells are subjected to sorting by flow cytometry for further purification. esc are predicted to be inherently safer than ips cells created with genetically-integrating viral vectors because they are not genetically modified with genes such as c-myc that are linked to cancer. nonetheless, esc express very high levels of the ips inducing genes and these genes including myc are essential for esc self-renewal and pluripotency, and potential strategies to improve safety by eliminating c-myc expression are unlikely to preserve the cells' ""stemness"". however, n-myc and l-myc have been identified to induce ips cells instead of c-myc with similar efficiency.
more recent protocols to induce pluripotency bypass these problems completely by using non-integrating rna viral vectors such as sendai virus or mrna transfection.


=== ethical debate ===

due to the nature of embryonic stem cell research, there are a lot of controversial opinions on the topic. since harvesting embryonic stem cells necessitates destroying the embryo from which those cells are obtained, the moral status of the embryo comes into question. some people claim that the 5-day old mass of cells is too young to achieve personhood or that the embryo, if donated from an ivf clinic (which is where labs typically acquire embryos from), would otherwise go to medical waste anyway. opponents of esc research claim that an embryo is a human life, therefore destroying it is murder and the embryo must be protected under the same ethical view as a more developed human being.


== history ==
1964: lewis kleinsmith and g. barry pierce jr. isolated a single type of cell from a teratocarcinoma, a tumor now known from a germ cell. these cells were isolated from the teratocarcinoma replicated and grew in cell culture as a stem cell and are now known as embryonal carcinoma (ec) cells.  although similarities in morphology and differentiating potential (pluripotency) led to the use of ec cells as the in vitro model for early mouse development, ec cells harbor genetic mutations and often abnormal karyotypes that accumulated during the development of the teratocarcinoma.  these genetic aberrations further emphasized the need to be able to culture pluripotent cells directly from the inner cell mass.
1981: embryonic stem cells (es cells) were independently first derived from a mouse embryos by two groups.  martin evans and matthew kaufman from the department of genetics, university of cambridge published first in july, revealing a new technique for culturing the mouse embryos in the uterus to allow for an increase in cell number, allowing for the derivation of es cell from these embryos. gail r. martin, from the department of anatomy, university of california, san francisco, published her paper in december and coined the term “embryonic stem cell”. she showed that embryos could be cultured in vitro and that es cells could be derived from these embryos.
1989: mario r. cappechi, martin j. evans, and oliver smithies publish their research that details their isolation and genetic modifications of embryonic stem cells, creating the first ""knockout mice"". in creating knockout mice, this publication provided scientists with an entirely new way to study disease.
1998: a team from the university of wisconsin, madison (james a. thomson, joseph itskovitz-eldor, sander s. shapiro, michelle a. waknitz, jennifer j. swiergiel, vivienne s. marshall, and jeffrey m. jones) publish a paper titled ""embryonic stem cell lines derived from human blastocysts"". the researchers behind this study not only created the first embryonic stem cells, but recognized their pluripotency, as well as their capacity for self-renewal. the abstract of the paper notes the significance of the discovery with regards to the fields of developmental biology and drug discovery.
2001: president george w. bush allows federal funding to support research on roughly 60—at this time, already existing—lines of embryonic stem cells. seeing as the limited lines that bush allowed research on had already been established, this law supported embryonic stem cell research without raising any ethical questions that could arise with the creation of new lines under federal budget.
2006: japanese scientists shinya yamanaka and kazutoshi takashi publish a paper describing the induction of pluripotent stem cells from cultures of adult mouse fibroblasts. induced pluripotent stem cells (ipscs) are a huge discovery, as they are seemingly identical to embryonic stem cells and could be used without sparking the same moral controversy.
january, 2009: the us food and drug administration (fda) provides approval for geron corporation's phase i trial of their human embryonic stem cell-derived treatment for spinal cord injuries. the announcement was met with excitement from the scientific community, but also with wariness from stem cell opposers. the treatment cells were, however, derived from the cell lines approved under george w. bush's esc policy.
march, 2009: executive order 13505 is signed by president barack obama, removing the restrictions put in place on federal funding for human stem cells by the previous presidential administration. this would allow the national institutes of health (nih) to provide funding for hesc research. the document also states that the nih must provide revised federal funding guidelines within 120 days of the order's signing.


== techniques and conditions for derivation and culture ==


=== derivation from humans ===
in vitro fertilization generates multiple embryos. the surplus of embryos is not clinically used or is unsuitable for implantation into the patient, and therefore may be donated by the donor with consent. human embryonic stem cells can be derived from these donated embryos or additionally they can also be extracted from cloned embryos using a cell from a patient and a donated egg. the inner cell mass (cells of interest), from the blastocyst stage of the embryo, is separated from the trophectoderm, the cells that would differentiate into extra-embryonic tissue. immunosurgery, the process in which antibodies are bound to the trophectoderm and removed by another solution, and mechanical dissection are performed to achieve separation. the resulting inner cell mass cells are plated onto cells that will supply support. the inner cell mass cells attach and expand further to form a human embryonic cell line, which are undifferentiated. these cells are fed daily and are enzymatically or mechanically separated every four to seven days. for differentiation to occur, the human embryonic stem cell line is removed from the supporting cells to form embryoid bodies, is co-cultured with a serum containing necessary signals, or is grafted in a three-dimensional scaffold to result.


=== derivation from other animals ===
embryonic stem cells are derived from the inner cell mass of the early embryo, which are harvested from the donor mother animal.  martin evans and matthew kaufman reported a technique that delays embryo implantation, allowing the inner cell mass to increase.  this process includes removing the donor mother's ovaries and dosing her with progesterone, changing the hormone environment, which causes the embryos to remain free in the uterus.  after 4–6 days of this intrauterine culture, the embryos are harvested and grown in in vitro culture until the inner cell mass forms “egg cylinder-like structures,” which are dissociated into single cells, and plated on fibroblasts treated with mitomycin-c (to prevent fibroblast mitosis).  clonal cell lines are created by growing up a single cell.  evans and kaufman showed that the cells grown out from these cultures could form teratomas and embryoid bodies, and differentiate in vitro, all of which indicating that the cells are pluripotent.gail martin derived and cultured her es cells differently.  she removed the embryos from the donor mother at approximately 76 hours after copulation and cultured them overnight in a medium containing serum.  the following day, she removed the inner cell mass from the late blastocyst using microsurgery.  the extracted inner cell mass was cultured on fibroblasts treated with mitomycin-c in a medium containing serum and conditioned by es cells.  after approximately one week, colonies of cells grew out.  these cells grew in culture and demonstrated pluripotent characteristics, as demonstrated by the ability to form teratomas, differentiate in vitro, and form embryoid bodies.  martin referred to these cells as es cells.it is now known that the feeder cells provide leukemia inhibitory factor (lif) and serum provides bone morphogenetic proteins (bmps) that are necessary to prevent es cells from differentiating. these factors are extremely important for the efficiency of deriving es cells.  furthermore, it has been demonstrated that different mouse strains have different efficiencies for isolating es cells. current uses for mouse es cells include the generation of transgenic mice, including knockout mice.  for human treatment, there is a need for patient specific pluripotent cells.  generation of human es cells is more difficult and faces ethical issues.  so, in addition to human es cell research, many groups are focused on the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (ips cells).


=== potential methods for new cell line derivation ===
on august 23, 2006, the online edition of nature scientific journal published a letter by dr. robert lanza (medical director of advanced cell technology in worcester, ma) stating that his team had found a way to extract embryonic stem cells without destroying the actual embryo. this technical achievement would potentially enable scientists to work with new lines of embryonic stem cells derived using public funding in the us, where federal funding was at the time limited to research using embryonic stem cell lines derived prior to august 2001.  in march, 2009, the limitation was lifted.human embryonic stem cells have also been derived by somatic cell nuclear transfer (scnt). this approach has also sometimes been referred to as ""therapeutic cloning"" because scnt bears similarity to other kinds of cloning in that nuclei are transferred from a somatic cell into an enucleated zygote. however, in this case scnt was used to produce embryonic stem cell lines in a lab, not living organisms via a pregnancy. the ""therapeutic"" part of the name is included because of the hope that scnt produced embryonic stem cells could have clinical utility.


=== induced pluripotent stem cells ===

the ipsc technology was pioneered by shinya yamanaka’s lab in kyoto, japan, who showed in 2006 that the introduction of four specific genes encoding transcription factors could convert adult cells into pluripotent stem cells. he was awarded the 2012 nobel prize along with sir john gurdon ""for the discovery that mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent."" in 2007 it was shown that pluripotent stem cells highly similar to embryonic stem cells can be generated by the delivery of three genes (oct4, sox2, and klf4) to differentiated cells. the delivery of these genes ""reprograms"" differentiated cells into pluripotent stem cells, allowing for the generation of pluripotent stem cells without the embryo. because ethical concerns regarding embryonic stem cells typically are about their derivation from terminated embryos, it is believed that reprogramming to these ""induced pluripotent stem cells"" (ips cells) may be less controversial. both human and mouse cells can be reprogrammed by this methodology, generating both human pluripotent stem cells and mouse pluripotent stem cells without an embryo.this may enable the generation of patient specific es cell lines that could potentially be used for cell replacement therapies.  in addition, this will allow the generation of es cell lines from patients with a variety of genetic diseases and will provide invaluable models to study those diseases.
however, as a first indication that the induced pluripotent stem cell (ips) cell technology can in rapid succession lead to new cures, it was used by a research team headed by rudolf jaenisch of the whitehead institute for biomedical research in cambridge, massachusetts, to cure mice of sickle cell anemia, as reported by science journal's online edition on december 6, 2007.on january 16, 2008, a california-based company, stemagen, announced that they had created the first mature cloned human embryos from single skin cells taken from adults. these embryos can be harvested for patient matching embryonic stem cells.


=== contamination by reagents used in cell culture ===
the online edition of nature medicine published a study on january 24, 2005, which stated that the human embryonic stem cells available for federally funded research are contaminated with non-human molecules from the culture medium used to grow the cells. it is a common technique to use mouse cells and other animal cells to maintain the pluripotency of actively dividing stem cells. the problem was discovered when non-human sialic acid in the growth medium was found to compromise the potential uses of the embryonic stem cells in humans, according to scientists at the university of california, san diego.however, a study published in the online edition of lancet medical journal on march 8, 2005 detailed information about a new stem cell line that was derived from human embryos under completely cell- and serum-free conditions. after more than 6 months of undifferentiated proliferation, these cells demonstrated the potential to form derivatives of all three embryonic germ layers both in vitro and in teratomas. these properties were also successfully maintained (for more than 30 passages) with the established stem cell lines.

omalizumab prefilled syringe,drug,"omalizumab, sold under the brand name xolair, is a medication originally designed to reduce sensitivity to allergens. it is typically prescribed to treat severe allergic asthma, which does not respond to high doses of corticosteroids and less widely for chronic spontaneous urticaria.
omalizumab is a recombinant dna-derived humanized igg1k monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to free human immunoglobulin e (ige) in the blood and interstitial fluid and to membrane-bound form of ige (mige) on the surface of mige-expressing b lymphocytes. unlike an ordinary anti-ige antibody, it does not bind to ige that is already bound by the high affinity ige receptor (fcεri) on the surface of mast cells, basophils, and antigen-presenting dendritic cells.


== medical uses ==


=== allergic asthma ===
omalizumab is used to treat people with severe, persistent allergic asthma, uncontrollable with oral or injectable corticosteroids. those patients have already failed step i to step iv treatments and are in step v of treatment. such a treatment scheme is consistent with the widely adopted guidelines for the management and prevention of asthma, issued by global initiative of asthma (gina), which was a medical guidelines organization launched in 1993 in collaboration with the national heart, lung, and blood institute, national institutes of health, usa, and the world health organization.


=== chronic spontaneous urticaria ===
omalizumab is indicated for chronic spontaneous urticaria  in adults and adolescents (>12 years old) poorly responsive to h1-antihistamine therapy. when administered subcutaneously once every four weeks, omalizumab has been shown to significantly decrease itch severity and hive count.


== adverse effects ==
the main adverse effect is anaphylaxis (a life-threatening systemic allergic reaction), with a rate of occurrence of 1 to 2 patients per 1,000.limited studies are available to confirm whether omalizumab increases the risk of developing cardiovascular (cv) or cerebrovascular disease (cbv). cohort and randomised controlled studies have shown that the risk of developing cv/cbv disease is around 20-32% higher in patients taking omalizumab compared to those not taking omalizumab[46,47]. additional multi-national, longitudinal studies with increased subject numbers are required to provide further clarification into the relationship and clinical significance between omalizumab and cv/cbv disease[46,47]. due to the severity of cv/cbvs side effects, clinicians and health care providers should continue to remain vigilant and monitor side effects when treating patients with omalizumab. 
ige may play an important role in the immune system's recognition of cancer cells. therefore, indiscriminate blocking of ige-receptor interaction with omalizumab may have unforeseen risks. the data pooled in 2003 from the earlier phase i to phase iii clinical trials showed a numeric imbalance in malignancies arising in omalizumab recipients (0.5%) compared with control subjects (0.2%). a 2012 study found that a causal link with cancer was unlikely.


== mechanism of action ==
the rationale for designing the anti-ige therapeutic antibodies and the pharmacological mechanisms of anti-ige therapy have been summarized in review articles by the inventor of the anti-ige therapy, tse wen chang, and his colleagues.perhaps the most dramatic effect, which was not foreseen at the time when the anti-ige therapy was designed and which was discovered during clinical trials, is that as the free ige in patients is depleted by omalizumab, the fcεri receptors on basophils, mast cells, and dendritic cells are gradually down-regulated with somewhat different kinetics, rendering those cells much less sensitive to stimulation by allergens.  thus, therapeutic anti-ige antibodies such as omalizumab represent a new class of potent mast cell stabilizers. this is now thought to be the fundamental mechanism for omalizumab's effects on allergic and non-allergic diseases involving mast cell degranulation. many investigators have identified or elucidated a host of pharmacological effects, which help bring down the inflammatory status in omalizumab-treated patients.


=== ige in allergic diseases ===
in conjunction with achieving the practical goal to investigate the applicability of the anti-ige therapy as a potential treatment for allergic diseases, the many corporate-sponsored clinical trials of tnx-901 and omalizumab on asthma, allergic rhinitis, peanut allergy, chronic idiopathic urticaria, atopic dermatitis, and other allergic diseases, have helped define the role of ige in the pathogenesis of these prevalent allergic diseases. for example, the clinical trial results of omalizumab on asthma have unambiguously settled the long debate whether ige plays a central role in the pathogenesis of asthma.
numerous investigator-initiated case studies or small-scale pilot studies of omalizumab have been performed on various allergic diseases and several non-allergic diseases, especially inflammatory skin diseases. these diseases include atopic dermatitis, various subtypes of physical urticaria (solar, cold-induced, local heat-induced, or delayed pressure-induced), and a spectrum of relatively less prevalent allergic or non-allergic diseases or conditions, such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, cutaneous or systemic mastocytosis, bee venom sensitivity (anaphylaxis), idiopathic anaphylaxis, eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal disorder, bullous pemphigoid, interstitial cystitis, nasal polyps, and idiopathic angiodema,.


=== roles in non-allergic diseases ===
several groups have reported clinical trial results that omalizumab may be effective in patients with non-allergic asthma. this seems to be contrary to the general understanding of the pharmacological mechanisms of the anti-ige therapy discussed above. furthermore, among the diseases in which omalizumab has been studied for efficacy and safety, some are not allergic diseases, because hypersensitivity reactions toward external antigens is not involved. for example, a portion of the cases of chronic idiopathic urticaria and all cases of bullous pemphigoid are clearly autoimmune diseases. for the remaining cases of chronic idiopathic urticaria and those of the different subtypes of physical urticaria, the internal abnormalities leading to the disease manifestation have not been identified. notwithstanding these developments, it is apparent that many of those diseases involve inflammatory reactions in the skin and the activation of mast cells. an increasing series of papers have shown that ige potentiates the activities of mast cells and omalizumab can function as a mast cell-stabilizing agent, rendering these inflammatory cells to be less active.


== chemistry and formulations ==
omalizumab is a glycosylated igg1 monoclonal antibody produced by cells of an adapted chinese hamster ovary (cho) cell line. the antibody molecules are secreted by the host cells in a cell culture process employing large-scale bioreactors. at the end of culturing, the igg contained in the medium is purified by an affinity-column using protein a as the adsorbent, followed by chromatography steps, and finally concentrated by uf/df (paired ultra filtration/depth filtration).  omalizumab is manufactured at the novartis' huningue manufacturing site (france) through a partnership agreement with genentech.
omalizumab was for several years provided only in a dry powder formulation, which requires the reconstitution with a prepacked solvent with the help of a shaker at the treating clinician's office before injection. a prefilled syringe liquid formulation has become available in many countries.


== history ==
the product concept of anti-ige antibodies against autologous ige epitopes was discovered by perinatal monoclonal ige immunization in rodents prior to the emergence of endogenous self ige  by swey-shen chen at the scripps research institute (tsri) and in case western reserve university (cwru), and later confirmed by dr. alfred nisonoff at brandeis university using monoclonal ige in incomplete freund's adjuvant in perinates. immunized or vaccinated rodents will develop low or undetectable levels of circulating ige in a long-term ige tolerance. consequently, the passive monoclonal antibodies against human ige can be tested for neutralizing pathological levels circulating ige in allergic patients. swey-shen chen was later an advisory consultant of tanox, inc.

tanox, a biopharmaceutical company based in houston, texas, started the anti-ige program, created antibody drug candidates, and filed its first patent application on the anti-ige therapeutic approach in 1987. in the next year, the company converted one candidate antibody to a chimeric antibody (which was later named cgp51901 and further developed into a humanized antibody, tnx-901 or talizumab). the anti-ige therapeutic concept was not well received in the early period of the program. in order to seek  funding for the anti-ige program, the two scientist founders of tanox, nancy t. chang and tse wen chang, visited about 25 pharmaceutical and larger biotech companies in the u.s., canada, europe, japan, and other countries to discuss collaboration throughout 1989. representatives of ciba-geigy (which merged with sandoz to form novartis in 1996) thought the anti-ige program scientifically interesting and executives from tanox and ciba-geigy signed a collaborative agreement in 1990 to develop the anti-ige program.in 1991, after several rounds of pre-ind (""investigational new drug"") meetings with officials/scientists of the fda, the fda finally gave a nod for cgp51901 to be tested in human subjects. this approval of ind for an anti-ige antibody for the first time was regarded a brave demonstration of professionalism for both the fda officials and the tanox/ciba-geigy team. the scientists participating in the pre-ind discussion comprehended that an ordinary anti-ige antibody (i.e., one without the set of binding specificity of cgp51901) would invariably activate mast cells and basophils and cause anaphylactic shocks and probably deaths among injected persons. notwithstanding this concern, they came to the same view that based on the presented scientific data, cgp51901 should have an absolutely required clean distinction from an ordinary anti-ige antibody in this regard. in 1991–1993, researchers from ciba-geigy and tanox and a leading clinical research group (headed by stephen holgate) in the asthma/allergy field ran a successful phase i human clinical trial of cgp51901 in southampton, england and showed that the tested antibody is safe. in 1994–1995, the tanox/ciba-geigy team conducted a phase ii trial of cgp51901 in patients with severe allergic rhinitis in texas and showed that cgp51901 is safe and efficacious in relieving allergic symptoms.while the tanox/ciba-geigy anti-ige program was gaining momentum, genentech announced in 1993 that it also had an anti-ige program for developing antibody therapeutics for asthma and other allergic diseases. scientists in genentech had made a mouse anti-ige monoclonal antibody with the binding specificity similar to that of cgp51901 and subsequently humanized the antibody (the antibody was later named ""omalizumab""). this caused great concerns in tanox, because it had disclosed its anti-ige technology and sent its anti-ige antibody candidate, which was to become cgp51901 and tnx-901, to genentech in 1989 for the latter to evaluate for the purpose of considering establishing a corporate partnership. having failed to receive reconciliation from genentech, tanox filed a lawsuit against genentech for trade secret violation. coincidentally, tanox started to receive major patents for its anti-ige invention from the european union and from the u.s. in 1995. after a 3-year legal entanglement, genentech and tanox settled their lawsuits out-of-court and tanox, novartis, and genentech formed a tripartite partnership to jointly develop the anti-ige program in 1996. omalizumab became the drug of choice for further development, because it had a better developed manufacturing process than tnx-901. a large number of corporate-sponsored clinical trials and physician-initiated case series studies on omalizumab have been planned and performed since 1996 and a large number of research reports, especially those of clinical trial results, have been published since around 2000, as described and referenced in other sections of this article.
in 2007, genetech bought tanox at $20/share for approximately $900 million.


== society and culture ==
due to the high cost of an omalizumab, and the concern over long-term safety, treatment is not yet very common, especially in developing countries. another barrier to wide use is its injectable dosage form. in august 2010, the national institute for clinical excellence (nice) in the united kingdom ruled that omalizumab should not be prescribed on the national health service (nhs) to children under 12. nice concluded that the high costs of the compound, over £250 per vial, did not represent a sufficiently high increase in quality of life. however, on march 7, 2013, nice issued “final draft guidance” about the allowance of omalizumab. it recommended the medication as an option for treating severe, persistent allergic asthma in adults, adolescents and children following additional analyses and submission of a patient access scheme (pas) by novartis, the manufacturer.in august 2013, a researcher at leiden university medical center responsible for the tiger trial was fired for unrelated research fraud. the tiger trial was halted as a result.in the united states it costs about $us540 to $4,600 per month as of 2020.

peyer's patch macrophage,cell,"peyer's patches (or aggregated lymphoid nodules) are organized lymphoid follicles, named after the 17th-century swiss anatomist johann conrad peyer. they are an important part of gut associated lymphoid tissue usually found in humans in the lowest portion of the small intestine, mainly in the distal jejunum and the ileum, but also could be detected in the duodenum.


== structure ==
peyer's patches are observable as elongated thickenings of the intestinal epithelium measuring a few centimeters in length. about 100 are found in humans. microscopically, peyer's patches appear as oval or round lymphoid follicles (similar to lymph nodes) located in the mucosa layer of the ileum and extend into the submucosa layer.
the number of peyer's patches peaks at age 15–25 and then declines during adulthood.
in the distal ileum, they are numerous and they form a lymphoid ring. at least 46% of peyer's patches are concentrated in the distal 25 cm of ileum in humans. it is important to note that there are large variations in size, shape, and distribution of peyer's patches from one individual to another one.
in adults, b lymphocytes are seen to dominate the follicles' germinal centers.  t lymphocytes are found in the zones between follicles. among the mononuclear cells, cd4+/cd25+ (10%) cells and cd8+/cd25+ (5%) cells are more abundant in peyer's patches than in the peripheral blood.peyer's patches are characterized by the follicle-associated epithelium (fae), which covers all lymphoid follicles. fae differs from typical small intestinal villus epithelium: it has fewer goblet cells therefore mucus layer is thinner, and it is also characterized by the presence of specialized m cells or microfold cells, which provide uptake and transport of antigens from lumen. moreover, basal lamina of follicle-associated epithelium is more porous compared to intestinal villus. finally, follicle-associated epithelium is less permeable for ions and macromolecules, basically due to higher expression of tight junction proteins.


== function ==
because the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract is exposed to the external environment, much of it is populated with potentially pathogenic microorganisms. peyer's patches thus establish their importance in the immune surveillance of the intestinal lumen and in facilitating production of the immune response within the mucosa.
pathogenic microorganisms and other antigens entering the intestinal tract encounter macrophages, dendritic cells, b-lymphocytes, and t-lymphocytes found in peyer's patches and other sites of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (galt). peyer's patches thus act for the gastrointestinal system much as the tonsils act for the respiratory system, trapping foreign particles, surveilling them, and destroying them.
peyer's patches are covered by a special follicle-associated epithelium that contains specialized cells called microfold cells (m cells) which sample antigen directly from the lumen and deliver it to antigen-presenting cells (located in a unique pocket-like structure on their basolateral side). dendritic cells and macrophages can also directly sample the lumen by extending dendrites through transcellular m cell-specific pores. at the same time the paracellular pathway of follicle-associated epithelium is closed tightly to prevent penetration of antigens and continuous contact with immune cells. t cells, b-cells and memory cells are stimulated upon encountering antigen in peyer's patches. these cells then pass to the mesenteric lymph nodes where the immune response is amplified. activated lymphocytes pass into the blood stream via the thoracic duct and travel to the gut where they carry out their final effector functions. the maturation of b-lymphocytes takes place in the peyer's patch.


== clinical significance ==
although important in the immune response, excessive growth of lymphoid tissue in peyer's patches is pathologic, as hypertrophy of peyer's patches has been closely associated with idiopathic intussusception.
having too many or larger than normal peyer's patches is associated with an increased risk of prion diseases.
salmonella typhi and poliovirus also target this section of the intestine.

ile-arg-ala,reagent,"modified grf (1-29) often abbreviated as mod grf (1-29), originally known as tetrasubstitued grf (1-29), is a term used to identify a 29 amino acid peptide analogue of growth-hormone-releasing hormone (ghrh), a releasing hormone of growth hormone (gh). it is a modified version of the shortest fully functional fragment of ghrh, often referred to as growth hormone releasing factor (1-29) (abbreviated as grf (1-29)), and also known by its standardized name, sermorelin.


== origin ==
the first 29 amino acids of ghrh were discovered to be as equally potent as its full 44 amino acid structure this fragment became known as grf (1-29). however, due to a rapid metabolic clearance analogues of grf (1-29) were synthesized to enhance the biological activity and reduce the rapidity of metabolic clearance. these analogues were primarily created by substituting amino acids within the peptide structure for amino acids more resistant to enzymatic cleavage. one early analogue substituted the amino acid l-alanine (abbreviated as ala or a) at the 2nd position of the peptide structure for its optical isomer (mirror image), d-alanine (abbreviated as d-ala). this substitution resulted in a peptide bond between d-ala and the 3rd amino acid in the structure aspartic acid (asp) more able to resist rapid cleavage by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4, a cleavage which had previously led to an inactive peptide fragment. this successful modification prompted the further creation of analogues with additional amino acid substitutions.
in 2005, the first specific mention of tetrasubstitued grf (1-29) appeared in a study that used it as one of the grf (1-29) analogue peptide structures studied. the term was used to describe the replacement of the 2nd, 8th, 15th, and 27th amino acids in the structure of grf (1-29).

france–madagascar relations,non_science,"france–madagascar relations refers to the diplomatic relations between the french republic and the republic of madagascar. france controlled madagascar beginning in 1895 until the islands nation's independence in 1960. both nations are today members of the francophonie and the united nations.


== history ==
in 1643, the french east india company came to madagascar and built a fort in the southern town of fort dauphin (today known as tôlanaro). for the next 30 years, the french maintained a fort there until 1674. since then, many french pirates operated on the island and maintained homes on nearby île sainte-marie.
in 1883, the french government sent a military expedition to madagascar which soon escalated into an armed conflict between the malagasy and the french and became known as the first franco-hova war (1893-1895). after the war, madagascar became a french protectorate. soon after the end of the war, a second conflict began between the royal government of queen ranavalona iii of madagascar and the french military escalating into the second franco-hova war (1894-1895). in 1895, queen ranavalona surrendered and in 1896 madagascar was formerly annexed by france.during world war ii madagascar fell under control of vichy france. from may through november 1942, the battle of madagascar took place on the northern tip of the island nation near the town of antsiranana (also known as diego-suarez). allied forces feared that the japanese government would take madagascar and use it as a base to control the indian ocean. in may 1942, british and allied force invaded madagascar and defeated the french forces loyal to vichy in november 1942.soon after the war, madagascar began to demand independence from france. in march 1947, the malagasy uprising began and lasted until december 1948 when french forces defeated the malagasy rebels. madagascar moved towards greater autonomy in several stages between 1958 and 1960. france offered three options in the constitutional referendum of september 1958: to be an overseas territory; a department; or ""a state  [...] that will deal with the french republic on a basis of equality... within the larger community"". madagascans chose the latter option. however throughout the regime of tsiranana (1959–72) the relationship to france remained strong, with french representation in the provincial assemblies and a french role in military and intelligence affairs, while the currency was linked to the french franc.today, relations between both nations remain strong, both politically and culturally. leaders of both nations have paid state visits to the each other's nations, respectively, and madagascar is huge recipient of french government aid and development assistance. madagascar is home to several thousand french expatriates and france is also home to a large malagasy diaspora.


== trade ==
in 2012, bilateral trade between both nations amounted to €632 million. madagascar's main export products to france include: textiles, agricultural and fish products whereas france's main exports to madagascar include: mechanical and electrical machinery and processed food and drinks. several french multinational companies operate in madagascar particularly in the banking, telephone and energy industries. french companies such as crédit agricole, société générale, orange and total all have offices and operate in madagascar.


== resident diplomatic missions ==

france has an embassy in antananarivo.

retinal bipolar neuron,cell,"a bipolar neuron, or bipolar cell, is a type of neuron that has two extensions (one axon and one dendrite). many bipolar cells are specialized sensory neurons for the transmission of sense. as such, they are part of the sensory pathways for smell, sight, taste, hearing, touch, balance and proprioception. the other shape classifications of neurons include unipolar, pseudounipolar and multipolar. during embryonic development, pseudounipolar neurons begin as bipolar in shape but become pseudounipolar as they mature.common examples are the retina bipolar cell, the ganglia of the vestibulocochlear nerve, the extensive use of bipolar cells to transmit efferent (motor) signals to control muscles, olfactory receptor neurons in the olfactory epithelium for smell (axons form the olfactory nerve), and neurons in the spiral ganglion for hearing (cn viii).


== in the retina ==
	
often found in the retina, bipolar cells are crucial as they serve as both direct and indirect cell pathways. the specific location of the bipolar cells allow them to facilitate the passage of signals from where they start in the receptors to where they arrive at the amacrine and ganglion cells. bipolar cells in the retina are also unusual in that they do not fire impulses like the other cells found within the nervous system. rather, they pass the information by graded signal changes. bipolar cells come in two varieties, having either an on-center or an off-center receptive field, each with a surround of the opposite sign. the off-center bipolar cells have excitatory synaptic connections with the photoreceptors, which fire continuously in the dark and are hyperpolarized (suppressed) by light. the excitatory synapses thus convey a suppressive signal to the off-center bipolar cells. on-center bipolar cells have inhibitory synapses with the photoreceptors and therefore are excited by light and suppressed in the dark.


== in the vestibular nerve ==
bipolar neurons exist within the vestibular nerve as it is responsible for special sensory sensations including hearing, equilibrium and motion detection. the majority of the bipolar neurons belonging to the vestibular nerve exist within the vestibular ganglion with axons extending into the maculae of utricle and saccule as well as into the ampullae of the semicircular canals.


== in the spinal ganglia ==
bipolar cells are also found in the spinal ganglia, when the cells are in an embryonic condition.
sometimes the extensions, also called processes, come off from opposite poles of the cell, and the cell then assumes a spindle shape.
in some cases where two fibers are apparently connected with a cell, one of the fibers is really derived from an adjoining nerve cell and is passing to end in a ramification around the ganglion cell, or, again, it may be coiled helically around the nerve process which is issuing from the cell.


== in the cerebral cortex ==
von economo neurons, also known as spindle neurons, found in a few select parts of the cerebral cortex of apes and some other intelligent animals, possess a single axon and dendrite and as such have been described as bipolar.

national autonomous university of león,non_science,"the national autonomous university of léon (spanish: universidad nacional autónoma de nicaragua, léon), founded in 1812, is a university in nicaragua. it was the second university founded in central america and the last founded under the colonial rule of the spanish empire.


== history ==
the first institution of higher learning in the colony of nicaragua was the conciliar seminary of st. raymond nonnatus, or tridentine college, which had been founded in 1680 by andrés de las navas y quevedo, o. de m., a friar of the mercedarian order who was the bishop of nicaragua. he did this upon his appointment to the leadership of that diocese in keeping with the requirements established by the council of trent for the training of the clergy of the catholic church.
the university was founded in 1812 by decree of the cortes of cádiz to raise this institution to a higher academic level. the original curriculum consisted of civil law, canon law and medicine. pharmaceutical studies were soon added.

transketolase-like protein 1 isoform h1 (human),protein,"dehydrogenase e1 and transketolase domain containing 1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the dhtkd1 gene. this gene encodes a component of a mitochondrial 2-oxoglutarate-dehydrogenase-complex-like protein involved in the degradation pathways of several amino acids, including lysine. mutations in this gene are associated with 2-aminoadipic 2-oxoadipic aciduria and charcot-marie-tooth disease type 2q.


== structure ==
the dhtkd1 gene encodes a protein that has 919 amino acids, and is one of two isoforms within the 2-oxoglutarate-dehydrogenase complex.


== function ==
dhtkd1 is part of an ogdhc-like supercomplex that is responsible for a crucial step in the degradation pathways of l-lysine, l-hydroxylysine, and l-tryptophan. specifically, this enzyme catalyzes the decarboxylation of 2-oxoadipate to glutaryl-coa.
there is a strong correlation between dhtkd1 expression levels and atp production, which signifies that dhtkd1 plays a critical role in energy production in mitochondria. moreover, suppression of dhtkd1 results in decreased levels of biogenesis and increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ros) within the mitochondria. globally, this impairs cell growth and enhances cell apoptosis.


== clinical significance ==
mutations in the dhtkd1 gene are associated with alpha-aminoadipic and alpha-ketoadipic aciduria, an autosomal recessive inborn error of lysine, hydroxylysine, and tryptophan degradation. only a handful of mutations have been observed in patients, including three missense mutations, two nonsense mutations, two splice donor mutations, one duplication, and one deletion and insertion. two missense mutations are the most common cause of the deficiency. the clinical presentation of this disease in inconsistent.mutations in this gene could also cause neurological abnormalities. indeed, one form of charcot-marie-tooth (cmt) disease has been associated with dhtkd1, although the disease encompasses a wide spectrum of clinical neuropathies. specifically, a hyterozygous nonsense mutation within the gene leads to decreased levels of dhtkd1 mrna and proteins, and impaired atp generation. this implicates this mutation as a causative agent for cmt-2 disease.

supporting cell of cochlea,cell,"the cochlea is the part of the inner ear involved in hearing. it is a spiral-shaped cavity in the bony labyrinth, in humans making 2.75 turns around its axis, the modiolus. a core component of the cochlea is the organ of corti, the sensory organ of hearing, which is distributed along the partition separating the fluid chambers in the coiled tapered tube of the cochlea.
the name cochlea derives from ancient greek  κοχλίας (kokhlias) 'spiral, snail shell'.


== structure ==

the cochlea (plural is cochleae) is a spiraled, hollow, conical chamber of bone, in which waves propagate from the base (near the middle ear and the oval window) to the apex (the top or center of the spiral). the spiral canal of the cochlea is a section of the bony labyrinth of the inner ear that is approximately 30 mm long and makes 2¾ turns about the modiolus. the cochlear structures include:

three scalae or chambers:
the vestibular duct or scala vestibuli (containing perilymph), which lies superior to the cochlear duct and abuts the oval window
the tympanic duct or scala tympani (containing  perilymph), which lies inferior to the cochlear duct and terminates at the round window
the cochlear duct  or scala media (containing endolymph) a region of high potassium ion concentration that the stereocilia of  the hair cells project into
the helicotrema, the location where the tympanic duct and the vestibular duct merge, at the apex of the cochlea
reissner's membrane, which separates the vestibular duct from the cochlear duct
the osseous spiral lamina, a main structural element that separates the cochlear duct from the tympanic duct
the basilar membrane, a main structural element that separates the cochlear duct from the tympanic duct and determines the mechanical wave propagation properties of the cochlear partition
the organ of corti, the sensory epithelium, a cellular layer on the basilar membrane, in which sensory hair cells are powered by the potential difference between the perilymph and the endolymph
hair cells, sensory cells in the organ of corti, topped with hair-like structures called stereocilia
the spiral ligament.the cochlea is a portion of the inner ear that looks like a snail shell (cochlea is greek for snail.) the cochlea receives sound in the form of vibrations, which cause the stereocilia to move. the stereocilia then convert these vibrations into nerve impulses which are taken up to the brain to be interpreted. two of the three fluid sections are canals and the third is a sensitive 'organ of corti' which detects pressure impulses that travel along the auditory nerve to the brain. the two canals are called the vestibular canal and the tympanic canal.


=== microanatomy ===
the walls of the hollow cochlea are made of bone, with a thin, delicate lining of epithelial tissue. this coiled tube is divided through most of its length by an inner membranous partition. two fluid-filled outer spaces (ducts or scalae) are formed by this dividing membrane. at the top of the snailshell-like coiling tubes, there is a reversal of the direction of the fluid, thus changing the vestibular duct to the tympanic duct. this area is called the helicotrema. this continuation at the helicotrema allows fluid being pushed into the vestibular duct by the oval window to move back out via movement in the tympanic duct and deflection of the round window; since the fluid is nearly incompressible and the bony walls are rigid, it is essential for the conserved fluid volume to exit somewhere.
the lengthwise partition that divides most of the cochlea is itself a fluid-filled tube, the third duct. this central column is called the cochlear duct. its fluid, endolymph, also contains electrolytes and proteins, but is chemically quite different from perilymph. whereas the perilymph is rich in sodium ions, the endolymph is rich in potassium ions, which produces an ionic, electrical potential.
the hair cells are arranged in four rows in the organ of corti along the entire length of the cochlear coil. three rows consist of outer hair cells (ohcs) and one row consists of inner hair cells (ihcs). the inner hair cells provide the main neural output of the cochlea. the outer hair cells, instead, mainly receive neural input from the brain, which influences their motility as part of the cochlea's mechanical pre-amplifier. the input to the ohc is from the olivary body via the medial olivocochlear bundle.
the cochlear duct is almost as complex on its own as the ear itself.  the cochlear duct is bounded on three sides by the basilar membrane, the stria vascularis, and reissner's membrane.  stria vascularis is a rich bed of capillaries and secretory cells; reissner's membrane is a thin membrane that separates endolymph from perilymph; and the basilar membrane is a mechanically somewhat stiff membrane, supporting the receptor organ for hearing, the organ of corti, and determines the mechanical wave propagation properties of the cochlear system.


== function ==

the cochlea is filled with a watery liquid, the endolymph, which moves in response to the vibrations coming from the middle ear via the oval window. as the fluid moves, the cochlear partition (basilar membrane and organ of corti) moves; thousands of hair cells sense the motion via their stereocilia, and convert that motion to electrical signals that are communicated via neurotransmitters to many thousands of nerve cells. these primary auditory neurons transform the signals into electrochemical impulses known as action potentials, which travel along the auditory nerve to structures in the brainstem for further processing.


=== hearing ===

the stapes (stirrup) ossicle bone of the middle ear transmits vibrations to the fenestra ovalis (oval window) on the outside of the cochlea, which vibrates the perilymph in the vestibular duct (upper chamber of the cochlea). the ossicles are essential for efficient coupling of sound waves into the cochlea, since the cochlea environment is a fluid–membrane system, and it takes more pressure to move sound through fluid–membrane waves than it does through air. a pressure increase is achieved by reducing the area ratio from the tympanic membrane (drum) to the oval window (stapes bone) by 20. as pressure =force/area, results in a pressure gain of about 20 times from the original sound wave pressure in air. this gain is a form of impedance matching – to match the soundwave travelling through air to that travelling in the fluid–membrane system.
at the base of the cochlea, each duct ends in a membranous portal that faces the middle ear cavity: the vestibular duct ends at the oval window, where the footplate of the stapes sits. the footplate vibrates when the pressure is transmitted via the ossicular chain.  the wave in the perilymph moves away from the footplate and towards the helicotrema. since those fluid waves move the cochlear partition that separates the ducts up and down, the waves have a corresponding symmetric part in perilymph of the tympanic duct, which ends at the round window, bulging out when the oval window bulges in.
the perilymph in the vestibular duct and the endolymph in the cochlear duct act mechanically as a single duct, being kept apart only by the very thin reissner's membrane.
the vibrations of the endolymph in the cochlear duct displace the basilar membrane in a pattern that peaks a distance from the oval window depending upon the soundwave frequency. the organ of corti vibrates due to outer hair cells further amplifying these vibrations. inner hair cells are then displaced by the vibrations in the fluid, and depolarise by an influx of k+ via their tip-link-connected channels, and send their signals via neurotransmitter to the primary auditory neurons of the spiral ganglion.
the hair cells in the organ of corti are tuned to certain sound frequencies by way of their location in the cochlea, due to the degree of stiffness in the basilar membrane.  this stiffness is due to, among other things, the thickness and width of the basilar membrane, which along the length of the cochlea is stiffest nearest its beginning at the oval window, where the stapes introduces the vibrations coming from the eardrum.  since its stiffness is high there, it allows only high-frequency vibrations to move the basilar membrane, and thus the hair cells.  the farther a wave travels towards the cochlea's apex (the helicotrema), the less stiff the basilar membrane is; thus lower frequencies travel down the tube, and the less-stiff membrane is moved most easily by them where the reduced stiffness allows:  that is, as the basilar membrane gets less and less stiff, waves slow down and it responds better to lower frequencies.  in addition, in mammals, the cochlea is coiled, which has been shown to enhance low-frequency vibrations as they travel through the fluid-filled coil.  this spatial arrangement of sound reception is referred to as tonotopy.
for very low frequencies (below 20 hz), the waves propagate along the complete route of the cochlea – differentially up vestibular duct and tympanic duct all the way to the helicotrema. frequencies this low still activate the organ of corti to some extent but are too low to elicit the perception of a pitch.  higher frequencies do not propagate to the helicotrema, due to the stiffness-mediated tonotopy.
a very strong movement of the basilar membrane due to very loud noise may cause hair cells to die. this is a common cause of partial hearing loss and is the reason why users of firearms or heavy machinery often wear earmuffs or earplugs.


=== hair cell amplification ===
not only does the cochlea ""receive"" sound, a healthy cochlea generates and amplifies sound when necessary.  where the organism needs a mechanism to hear very faint sounds, the cochlea amplifies by the reverse transduction of the ohcs, converting electrical signals back to mechanical in a positive-feedback configuration.  the ohcs have a protein motor called prestin on their outer membranes; it generates additional movement that couples back to the fluid–membrane wave. this ""active amplifier"" is essential in the ear's ability to amplify weak sounds.the active amplifier also leads to the phenomenon of soundwave vibrations being emitted from the cochlea back into the ear canal through the middle ear (otoacoustic emissions).


=== otoacoustic emissions ===
otoacoustic emissions are due to a wave exiting the cochlea via the oval window, and propagating back through the middle ear to the eardrum, and out the ear canal, where it can be picked up by a microphone.  otoacoustic emissions are important in some types of tests for hearing impairment, since they are present when the cochlea is working well, and less so when it is suffering from loss of ohc activity.


=== role of gap junctions ===
gap-junction proteins, called connexins, expressed in the cochlea play an important role in auditory functioning. mutations in gap-junction genes have been found to cause syndromic and nonsyndromic deafness.  certain connexins, including connexin 30 and connexin 26, are prevalent in the two distinct gap-junction systems found in the cochlea.  the epithelial-cell gap-junction network couples non-sensory epithelial cells, while the connective-tissue gap-junction network couples connective-tissue cells.  gap-junction channels recycle potassium ions back to the endolymph after mechanotransduction in hair cells.  importantly, gap junction channels are found between cochlear supporting cells, but not auditory hair cells.


== clinical significance ==


=== hearing loss ===


=== bionics ===
in 2009, engineers at the massachusetts institute of technology created an electronic chip that can quickly analyze a very large range of radio frequencies while using only a fraction of the power needed for existing technologies; its design specifically mimics a cochlea.


== other animals ==
the coiled form of cochlea is unique to mammals. in birds and in other non-mammalian vertebrates, the compartment containing the sensory cells for hearing is occasionally also called ""cochlea,"" despite not being coiled up. instead, it forms a blind-ended tube, also called the cochlear duct. this difference apparently evolved in parallel with the differences in frequency range of hearing between mammals and non-mammalian vertebrates. the superior frequency range in mammals is partly due to their unique mechanism of pre-amplification of sound by active cell-body vibrations of outer hair cells. frequency resolution is, however, not better in mammals than in most lizards and birds, but the upper frequency limit is – sometimes much – higher. most bird species do not hear above 4–5 khz, the currently known maximum being ~ 11 khz in the barn owl. some marine mammals hear up to 200 khz. a long coiled compartment, rather than a short and straight one, provides more space for additional octaves of hearing range, and has made possible some of the highly derived behaviors involving mammalian hearing.as the study of the cochlea should fundamentally be focused at the level of hair cells, it is important to note the anatomical and physiological differences between the hair cells of various species.  in birds, for instance, instead of outer and inner hair cells, there are tall and short hair cells.  there are several similarities of note in regard to this comparative data.  for one, the tall hair cell is very similar in function to that of the inner hair cell, and the short hair cell, lacking afferent auditory-nerve fiber innervation, resembles the outer hair cell.  one unavoidable difference, however, is that while all hair cells are attached to a tectorial membrane in birds, only the outer hair cells are attached to the tectorial membrane in mammals.


== history ==
the name cochlea is derived from the latin word for snail shell, which in turn is from the greek κοχλίας kokhlias (""snail, screw""), from κόχλος kokhlos (""spiral shell"") in reference to its coiled shape; the cochlea is coiled in mammals with the exception of monotremes.

serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (mouse),protein,"serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (srsf1) also known as alternative splicing factor 1 (asf1), pre-mrna-splicing factor sf2 (sf2) or asf1/sf2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the srsf1 gene. asf/sf2 is an essential sequence specific splicing factor involved in pre-mrna splicing. srsf1 is the gene that codes for asf/sf2 and is found on chromosome 17.  the resulting splicing factor is a protein of approximately 33 kda. asf/sf2 is necessary for all splicing reactions to occur, and influences splice site selection in a concentration-dependent manner, resulting in alternative splicing. in addition to being involved in the splicing process, asf/sf2 also mediates post-splicing activities, such as mrna nuclear export and translation.


== structure ==
asf/sf2 is an sr protein, and as such, contains two functional modules: an arginine-serine rich region (rs domain), where the bulk of asf/sf2 regulation takes place, and two rna recognition motifs (rrms), through which asf/sf2 interacts with rna and other splicing factors. these modules have different functions within general splicing factor function.


== splicing ==
asf/sf2 is an integral part of numerous components of the splicing process.  asf/sf2 is required for 5’ splice site cleavage and selection, and is capable of discriminating between cryptic and authentic splice sites. subsequent lariat formation during the first chemical step of pre-mrna splicing also requires asf/sf2. asf/sf2 promotes recruitment of the u1 snrnp to the 5’ splice site, and bridges the 5’ and 3’ splice sites to facilitate splicing reactions. asf/sf2 also associates with the u2 snrnp. during the  reaction, asf/sf2 promotes the use of intron proximal sites and hinders the use of intron distal sites, affecting alternative splicing. alternative splicing is affected by asf/sf2 in a concentration-dependent manner; differing concentrations of asf/sf2 is a mechanism for alternative splicing regulation, and will result in differing amounts of product isoforms. asf/sf2 accomplishes this regulation through direct or indirect binding to exonic splicing enhancer (ese) sequences.


== post-splicing ==
asf/sf2, in the presence of elf4e, promotes the initiation of translation of ribosome-bound mrna by suppressing the activity of 4e-bp and recruiting molecules for further regulation of translation. asf/sf2 interacts with the nuclear export protein tap in a regulated manner, controlling the export of mature mrna from the nucleus. an increase in cellular asf/sf2 also will increase the efficiency of nonsense-mediated mrna decay (nmd), favoring nmd that occurs before mrna release from the nucleus over nmd that occurs after mrna export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. this shift in nmd caused by increased asf/sf2 is accompanied by overall enhancement of the pioneer round of translation, through elf4e-bound mrna translation and subsequent translationally active ribosomes, increased association of pioneer translation initiation complexes with asf/sf2, and increased levels of active tap.


== regulation through phosphorylation ==
asf/sf2 has the ability to be phosphorylated at the serines in its rs domain by the sr specific protein kinase, srpk1. srpk1 and asf/sf2 form an unusually stable complex of apparent kd of 50nm. srpk1 selectively phosphorylates up to twelve serines in the rs domain of asf/sf2 through a directional and processive mechanism, moving from the c terminus to the n terminus. this multi-phosphorylation directs asf/sf2 to the nucleus, influencing a number of protein-protein interactions associated with splicing. asf/sf2's function in export of mature mrna from the nucleus is dependent on its phosphorylation state; dephosphorylation of asf/sf2 facilitates binding to tap, while phosphorylation directs asf/sf2 to nuclear speckles. both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of asf/sf2 are important and necessary for proper splicing to occur, as sequential phosphorylation and dephosphorylation marks the transitions between stages in the splicing process. in addition, hypophosphorylation and hyperphosphorylation of asf/sf2 by clk/sty can lead to inhibition of splicing.

asf/sf2 is involved in genomic stability; it is thought that rna polymerase recruits asf/sf2 to nascent rna transcripts to impede formation of mutagenic dna:rna hybrid r-loop structures between the transcript and the template dna. in this way, asf/sf2 is protecting cells from the potential deleterious effects of transcription itself. asf/sf2 is also implicated in cellular mechanisms to hinder exon skipping and to ensure splicing is occurring accurately and correctly.


=== development and growth ===
asf/sf2 has been shown to have a critical function in heart development, embryogenesis, tissue formation, cell motility, and cell viability in general.


== clinical significance ==
sfrs1 is a proto-oncogene, and thus asf/sf2 can act as an oncoprotein; it can alter the splicing patterns of crucial cell cycle regulatory genes and suppressor genes. asf/sf2 controls the splicing of various tumor suppressor genes, kinases, and kinase receptors, all of which have the potential to be alternatively spliced into oncogenic isoforms. as such, asf/sf2 is an important target for cancer therapy, as it is over-expressed in many tumors.modifications and defects in the alternative splicing pathway are associated with a variety of human diseases.asf/sf2 is involved in the replication of hiv-1, as hiv-1 needs a delicate balance of spliced and unspliced forms of its viral dna. asf/sf2 action in the replication of hiv-1 is a potential target for hiv therapy. asf/sf2 is also implicated in the production of t cell receptors in systemic lupus erythematosus, altering specific chain expression in t cell receptors through alternative splicing.

respiratory epithelial cell,cell,"respiratory epithelium, or airway epithelium, is a type of ciliated columnar epithelium found lining most of the respiratory tract as respiratory mucosa, where it serves to moisten and protect the airways. it is not present in the vocal cords of the larynx, or the oropharynx and laryngopharynx, where instead the epithelium is stratified squamous. it also functions as a barrier to potential pathogens and foreign particles, preventing infection and tissue injury by the secretion of mucus and the action of mucociliary clearance.


== structure ==

the respiratory epithelium lining the upper respiratory airways is classified as ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium. this designation is due to the arrangement of the multiple cell types composing the respiratory epithelium. while all cells make contact with the basement membrane and are, therefore, a single layer of cells, the nuclei are not aligned in the same plane. hence, it appears as though several layers of cells are present and the epithelium is called pseudostratified (falsely layered). the respiratory mucosa transitions to simple cuboidal epithelium and finally to simple squamous epithelium in the alveolar ducts and alveoli.


=== cells ===
the cells in the respiratory epithelium are of four main types: a) ciliated cells, b) goblet cells, c) club cells, and d) airway basal cells. goblet cells become increasingly fewer further down the respiratory tree until they are absent in the terminal bronchioles; club cells take over their role to some extent here. another important cell type is the pulmonary neuroendocrine cell. these are innervated cells that only make up around 0.5% of the respiratory epithelial cells. the ciliated cells are columnar epithelial cells with specialized ciliary modifications. the ciliated cells make up between 50 and 80 per cent of the epithelium.between the ciliated cells are numerous microvilli, attached as tufts to brush cells sometimes referred to as pulmonary brush cells; these are also known as the tuft cells of the gastrointestinal tract, or intestinal tuft cells, although there is a difference between the two types: the brush cells lack the terminal web that lies under the microvilli of the tuft cells. their function is unknown but their locations particularly at the alveoli suggest a clearance role.


== function ==
the respiratory epithelium functions to moisten and protect the airways. it acts as a physical barrier to pathogens, as well as their removal in the mechanism  of mucociliary clearance.
the ciliated cells are the primary components in the mucociliary clearance mechanism. each epithelial cell has around 200 cilia that beat constantly at a rate of between 10 and 20 times per second. the direction of their beat is targeted towards the pharynx, either upwards from the lower respiratory tract or downwards from the nasal structures.goblet cells, so named because they are shaped like a wine goblet, are columnar epithelial cells that contain membrane-bound mucous granules and secrete mucus as part of the airway surface liquid (asl), also known as the epithelial lining fluid, the composition of which is tightly regulated; the mucus helps maintain epithelial moisture and traps particulate material and pathogens moving through the airway. and determines how well mucociliary clearance works.the basal cells are small, nearly cuboidal that differentiate into the other cell types found within the epithelium. basal cells respond to injury of the airway epithelium, migrating to cover a site denuded of differentiated epithelial cells, and subsequently differentiating to restore a healthy epithelial cell layer. the differentiated epithelial cells can also dedifferentiate into stem cells and contribute to the repairing of the barrier.club cells carry out similar functions in the more distal airways. 
certain parts of the respiratory tract, such as the oropharynx, are also subject to the abrasive swallowing of food. to prevent the destruction of the epithelium in these areas, it changes  to stratified squamous epithelium, which is better suited to the constant sloughing and abrasion.  the squamous layer of the oropharynx is continuous with the esophagus.the respiratory epithelium has a further role of immunity for the lungs -  that of glucose homeostasis. the glucose concentration in the airway surface liquid is held at a level of around 12 times lower than that of the blood sugar concentration. the tight junctions act as a barrier that restricts the passage of glucose across the epithelium into the airway lumen. some glucose passes through, where it diffuses into the airway surface liquid to be kept at its reduced level by pulmonary glucose transport, and metabolism. however, airway inflammation decreases the effectiveness of the tight junctions making the barrier more permeable to glucose. higher levels of glucose promote the proliferation of bacteria by providing glucose as a source for carbon for them. increased levels of glucose in the airway surface liquid is associated with respiratory diseases, and hyperglycemia.


== clinical significance ==
long-term irritation of the epithelial cells can cause the overproduction of mucus, known as mucus hypersecretion. mucus hypersecretion results in the productive cough of chronic bronchitis.pulmonary neuroendocrine cells have been associated with a range of chronic lung disorders. they are also the originating cells of small-cell lung cancer.

hypocretin-secreting neuron,cell,"narcolepsy is a long-term neurological disorder that involves a decreased ability to regulate sleep-wake cycles. symptoms often include periods of excessive daytime sleepiness and brief involuntary sleep episodes. about 70% of those affected also experience episodes of sudden loss of muscle strength, known as cataplexy. these experiences can be brought on by strong emotions. less commonly, there may be vivid hallucinations or an inability to move (sleep paralysis) while falling asleep or waking up. people with narcolepsy tend to sleep about the same number of hours per day as people without, but the quality of sleep tends to be lessened.the exact cause of narcolepsy is unknown, with potentially several causes. in up to 10% of cases, there is a family history of the disorder. often, those affected have low levels of the neuropeptide orexin, which may be due to an autoimmune disorder. in rare cases, narcolepsy can be caused by traumatic brain injury, tumors, or other diseases affecting the parts of the brain that regulate wakefulness or rem sleep. diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms and sleep studies, after ruling out other potential causes. excessive daytime sleepiness can also be caused by other sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, major depressive disorder, anemia, heart failure, drinking alcohol and not getting enough sleep. cataplexy may be mistaken for seizures.while there is no cure, a number of lifestyle changes and medications may help. lifestyle changes include taking regular short naps and sleep hygiene. medications used include modafinil, sodium oxybate and methylphenidate. while initially effective, tolerance to the benefits may develop over time. tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) may improve cataplexy.estimates of frequency range from 0.2 to 600 per 100,000 people in various countries. the condition often begins in childhood, with males and females being affected equally. untreated narcolepsy increases the risk of motor vehicle collisions and falls.


== signs and symptoms ==
there are two main characteristics of narcolepsy: excessive daytime sleepiness and abnormal rem sleep. excessive daytime sleepiness occurs even after adequate night time sleep. a person with narcolepsy is likely to become drowsy or fall asleep, often at inappropriate or undesired times and places, or just be very tired throughout the day. narcoleptics may not be able to experience the amount of restorative deep sleep that healthy people experience due to abnormal rem regulation – they are not ""over-sleeping"". narcoleptics typically have higher rem sleep density than non-narcoleptics, but also experience more rem sleep without atonia. many narcoleptics have sufficient rem sleep, but do not feel refreshed or alert throughout the day. this can feel like living their entire lives in a constant state of sleep deprivation.excessive sleepiness can vary in severity, and it appears most commonly during monotonous situations that don't require much interaction. daytime naps may occur with little warning and may be physically irresistible. these naps can occur several times a day. they are typically refreshing, but only for a few hours or less. vivid dreams may be experienced on a regular basis, even during very brief naps. drowsiness may persist for prolonged periods or remain constant. in addition, night-time sleep may be fragmented, with frequent awakenings. a second prominent symptom of narcolepsy is abnormal rem sleep. narcoleptics are unique in that they enter into the rem phase of sleep in the beginnings of sleep, even when sleeping during the day.the classic symptoms of the disorder, often referred to as the ""tetrad of narcolepsy,"" are cataplexy, sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations, and excessive daytime sleepiness. other symptoms may include automatic behaviors and night-time wakefulness. these symptoms may not occur in all people with narcolepsy.

cataplexy is an episodic loss of muscle function, ranging from slight weakness such as limpness at the neck or knees, sagging facial muscles, weakness at the knees often referred to as ""knee buckling"", or inability to speak clearly, to a complete body collapse. episodes may be triggered by sudden emotional reactions such as laughter, anger, surprise, or fear. the person remains conscious throughout the episode. in some cases, cataplexy may resemble epileptic seizures. usually speech is slurred and vision is impaired (double vision, inability to focus), but hearing and awareness remain normal. cataplexy also has a severe emotional impact on narcoleptics, as it can cause extreme anxiety, fear, and avoidance of people or situations that might elicit an attack. cataplexy is generally considered to be unique to narcolepsy and is analogous to sleep paralysis in that the usually protective paralysis mechanism occurring during sleep is inappropriately activated. the opposite of this situation (failure to activate this protective paralysis) occurs in rapid eye movement behavior disorder.
periods of wakefulness at night
sleep paralysis is the temporary inability to talk or move when waking (or less often, when falling asleep). it may last a few seconds to minutes. this is often frightening but is not dangerous.
hypnagogic hallucinations are vivid, often frightening, dreamlike experiences that occur while dozing or falling asleep. hypnopompic hallucinations refer to the same sensations while awakening from sleep. these hallucinations may manifest in the form of visual or auditory sensations.in most cases, the first symptom of narcolepsy to appear is excessive and overwhelming daytime sleepiness. the other symptoms may begin alone or in combination months or years after the onset of the daytime naps. there are wide variations in the development, severity, and order of appearance of cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations in individuals. only about 20 to 25 percent of people with narcolepsy experience all four symptoms. the excessive daytime sleepiness generally persists throughout life, but sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations may not.
many people with narcolepsy also suffer from insomnia for extended periods of time. the excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy often become severe enough to cause serious problems in a person's social, personal, and professional life. normally, when an individual is awake, brain waves show a regular rhythm. when a person first falls asleep, the brain waves become slower and less regular, which is called non-rapid eye movement (nrem) sleep. after about an hour and a half of nrem sleep, the brain waves begin to show a more active pattern again, called rem sleep (rapid eye movement sleep), when most remembered dreaming occurs. associated with the eeg-observed waves during rem sleep, muscle atonia is present called rem atonia.in narcolepsy, the order and length of nrem and rem sleep periods are disturbed, with rem sleep occurring at sleep onset instead of after a period of nrem sleep. also, some aspects of rem sleep that normally occur only during sleep, like lack of muscular control, sleep paralysis, and vivid dreams, occur at other times in people with narcolepsy. for example, the lack of muscular control can occur during wakefulness in a cataplexy episode; it is said that there is an intrusion of rem atonia during wakefulness. sleep paralysis and vivid dreams can occur while falling asleep or waking up. simply put, the brain does not pass through the normal stages of dozing and deep sleep but goes directly into (and out of) rapid eye movement (rem) sleep.as a consequence night time sleep does not include as much deep sleep, so the brain tries to ""catch up"" during the day, hence excessive daytime sleepiness. people with narcolepsy may visibly fall asleep at unpredicted moments (such motions as head bobbing are common). people with narcolepsy fall quickly into what appears to be very deep sleep, and they wake up suddenly and can be disoriented when they do (dizziness is a common occurrence). they have very vivid dreams, which they often remember in great detail. people with narcolepsy may dream even when they only fall asleep for a few seconds. along with vivid dreaming, people with narcolepsy are known to have audio or visual hallucinations prior to falling asleep.narcoleptics can gain excess weight; children can gain 20 to 40 lb (9 to 18 kg) when they first develop narcolepsy; in adults the body-mass index is about 15% above average.


== causes ==
the exact cause of narcolepsy is unknown, and it may be caused by several distinct factors. the mechanism involves the loss of orexin-releasing neurons within the lateral hypothalamus (about 70,000 neurons).in up to 10% of cases there is a family history of the disorder. family history is more common in narcolepsy with cataplexy. there is a strong link with certain genetic variants. in addition to genetic factors, low levels of orexin peptides have been correlated with a past history of infection, diet, contact with toxins such as pesticides, and brain injuries due to head trauma, brain tumors or strokes. autoimmunity may also play a role.


=== genetics ===
the primary genetic factor that has been strongly implicated in the development of narcolepsy involves an area of chromosome 6 known as the human leukocyte antigen (hla) complex. specific variations in hla genes are strongly correlated with the presence of narcolepsy; however, these variations are not required for the condition to occur and sometimes occur in individuals without narcolepsy. these genetic variations in the hla complex are thought to increase the risk of an auto-immune response to orexin-releasing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus.the allele hla-dqb1*06:02 of the human gene hla-dqb1 was reported in more than 90% of people with narcolepsy, and alleles of other hla genes such as hla-dqa1*01:02 have been linked. a 2009 study found a strong association with polymorphisms in the trac gene locus (dbsnp ids rs1154155, rs12587781, and rs1263646). a 2013 review article reported additional but weaker links to the loci of the genes tnfsf4 (rs7553711), cathepsin h (rs34593439), and p2ry11-dnmt1 (rs2305795).
another gene locus that has been associated with narcolepsy is eif3g (rs3826784).


=== h1n1 vaccine ===
a link between glaxosmithkline's h1n1 flu vaccine pandemrix and narcolepsy has been found in both children and adults. finland's national institute of health and welfare recommended that pandemrix vaccinations be suspended pending further investigation into narcolepsy.


== pathophysiology ==


=== loss of neurons ===
orexin, otherwise known as hypocretin, is a neuropeptide that acts within the brain to regulate appetite and wakefulness as well as a number of other cognitive and physiological processes. loss of these orexin-producing neurons causes narcolepsy and most individuals with narcolepsy have a reduced number of these neurons in their brains. selective destruction of the hcrt/ox neurons with preservation of proximate structures suggests a highly specific autoimmune pathophysiology. cerebrospinal fluid hcrt-1/ox-a is undetectable in up to 95% of patients with type 1 narcolepsy.the system which regulates sleep, arousal, and transitions between these states in humans is composed of three interconnected subsystems: the orexin projections from the lateral hypothalamus, the reticular activating system, and the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus. in narcoleptic individuals, these systems are all associated with impairments due to a greatly reduced number of hypothalamic orexin projection neurons and significantly fewer orexin neuropeptides in cerebrospinal fluid and neural tissue, compared to non-narcoleptic individuals. those with narcolepsy generally experience the rem stage of sleep within five minutes of falling asleep, while people who do not have narcolepsy (unless they are significantly sleep deprived) do not experience rem until after a period of slow-wave sleep, which lasts for about the first hour or so of a sleep cycle.


=== disturbed sleep states ===
the neural control of normal sleep states and the relationship to narcolepsy are only partially understood. in humans, narcoleptic sleep is characterized by a tendency to go abruptly from a waking state to rem sleep with little or no intervening non-rem sleep. the changes in the motor and proprioceptive systems during rem sleep have been studied in both human and animal models. during normal rem sleep, spinal and brainstem alpha motor neuron hyperpolarization produces almost complete atonia of skeletal muscles via an inhibitory descending reticulospinal pathway. acetylcholine may be one of the neurotransmitters involved in this pathway. in narcolepsy, the reflex inhibition of the motor system seen in cataplexy has features normally seen only in normal rem sleep.


== diagnosis ==
the third edition of the international classification of sleep disorders (icsd-3) differentiates between narcolepsy with cataplexy (type 1) and narcolepsy without cataplexy (type 2), while the fifth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (dsm-5) uses the diagnosis of narcolepsy to refer to type 1 narcolepsy only. the dsm-5 refers to narcolepsy without cataplexy as hypersomnolence disorder. the most recent edition of the international classification of diseases, icd-11, currently identifies three types of narcolepsy: type 1 narcolepsy, type 2 narcolepsy, and unspecified narcolepsy.icsd-3 diagnostic criteria posits that the individual must experience ""daily periods of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into sleep"" for both subtypes of narcolepsy. this symptom must last for at least three months. for a diagnosis of type 1 narcolepsy, the person must present with either cataplexy, a mean sleep latency of less than 8 minutes, and two or more sleep-onset rem periods (soremps), or they must present with a hypocretin-1 concentration of less than 110 pg/ml. a diagnosis of type 2 narcolepsy requires a mean sleep latency of less than 8 minutes, two or more soremps, and a hypocretin-1 concentration of more than 110 pg/ml. in addition, the hypersomnolence and sleep latency findings cannot be better explained by other causes.dsm-5 narcolepsy criteria requires that the person to display recurrent periods of ""an irrepressible need to sleep, lapsing into sleep, or napping"" for at least three times a week over a period of three months. the individual must also display one of the following: cataplexy, hypocretin-1 concentration of less than 110 pg/ml, rem sleep latency of less than 15 minutes, or a multiple sleep latency test (mslt) showing sleep latency of less than 8 minutes and two or more soremps. for a diagnosis of hypersomnolence disorder, the individual must present with excessive sleepiness despite at least 7 hours of sleep as well as either recurrent lapses into daytime sleep, nonrestorative sleep episodes of 9 or more hours, or difficulty staying awake after awakening. in addition, the hypersomnolence must occur at least three times a week for a period of three months, and must be accompanied by significant distress or impairment. it also cannot be explained by another sleep disorder, coexisting mental or medical disorders, or medication.


=== tests ===
diagnosis is relatively easy when all the symptoms of narcolepsy are present, but if the sleep attacks are isolated and cataplexy is mild or absent, diagnosis is more difficult. three tests that are commonly used in diagnosing narcolepsy are polysomnography (psg), the multiple sleep latency test (mslt), and the epworth sleepiness scale (ess). these tests are usually performed by a sleep specialist.polysomnography involves the continuous recording of sleep brain waves and a number of nerve and muscle functions during night time sleep. when tested, people with narcolepsy fall asleep rapidly, enter rem sleep early, and may often awaken during the night. the polysomnogram also helps to detect other possible sleep disorders that could cause daytime sleepiness.the epworth sleepiness scale is a brief questionnaire that is administered to determine the likelihood of the presence of a sleep disorder, including narcolepsy.the multiple sleep latency test is performed after the person undergoes an overnight sleep study. the person will be asked to sleep once every 2 hours, and the time it takes for them to do so is recorded. most individuals will fall asleep within 5 to 8 minutes, as well as display rem sleep faster than non-narcoleptic people.measuring orexin levels in a person's cerebrospinal fluid sampled in a spinal tap may help in diagnosing narcolepsy, with abnormally low levels serving as an indicator of the disorder. this test can be useful when mslt results are inconclusive or difficult to interpret.


== treatment ==
people with narcolepsy can be substantially helped, but not cured. however, the technology exists in early form such as experiments in using the prepro-orexin transgene via gene editing restored normal function in mice models by making other neurons produce orexin after the original set have been destroyed or replacing the missing orexinergic neurons with hypocretin stem cell transplantation are both steps in that direction for fixing the biology effectively permanently once applied in humans. additionally effective ideal non-gene editing and chemical-drug methods involve hypocretin treatments methods such as future drugs like hypocretin agonists (such as tak-994)  which the enterprise targets it to be available by 2024 or hypocretin replacement, in the form of hypocretin 1
given intravenous (injected into the veins), intracisternal (direct injection into the brain), and intranasal (sprayed through the nose), the latter being low in efficacy, at the low amount used in current experiments but may be effective at very high doses in the future.general strategies like people and family education, sleep hygiene and medication compliance, and discussion of safety issues for example driving license can be useful. potential side effects of medication can also be addressed. regular follow-up is useful to be able to monitor the response to treatment, to assess the presence of other sleep disorders like obstructive sleep apnea, and to discuss psychosocial issues.the main treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy is central nervous system stimulants such as methylphenidate, amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, modafinil, and armodafinil. in late 2007 an alert for severe adverse skin reactions to modafinil was issued by the fda.several studies also showed that sodium oxybate is effective to treat cataplexy.another drug that is used is atomoxetine, a non-stimulant and a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (nri), which has no addiction liability or recreational effects. in many cases, planned regular short naps can reduce the need for pharmacological treatment of the eds, but only improve symptoms for a short duration. a 120-minute nap provided benefit for 3 hours in the person's alertness whereas a 15-minute nap provided no benefit. daytime naps are not a replacement for night time sleep. ongoing communication between the health care provider, person, and their family members is important for optimal management of narcolepsy.
another fda-approved treatment option for narcolepsy is sodium oxybate, also known as sodium gamma-hydroxybutyrate (ghb). it can be used for cataplexy associated with narcolepsy and excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy.solriamfetol is a new molecule indicated for narcolespy of type 1 and 2.


=== antidepressants ===
narcolepsy has sometimes been treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants, such as clomipramine, imipramine, or protriptyline, as well as other drugs that suppress rem sleep. venlafaxine, an antidepressant which blocks the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, has shown usefulness in managing symptoms of cataplexy, however, it has notable side-effects including sleep disruption. the antidepressant class is used mainly for the treatment of cataplexy, for people with narcolepsy without cataplexy these are usually not used.


=== children ===
common behavioral treatments for childhood narcolepsy include improved sleep hygiene, scheduled naps, and physical exercise.many medications are used in treating adults and may be used to treat children. these medications include central nervous system stimulants such as methylphenidate, modafinil, amphetamine, and dextroamphetamine. other medications, such as sodium oxybate or atomoxetine may also be used to counteract sleepiness. medications such as sodium oxybate, venlafaxine, fluoxetine, and clomipramine may be prescribed if the child presents with cataplexy.


== epidemiology ==
estimates of frequency range from 0.2 per 100,000 in israel to 600 per 100,000 in japan. these differences may be due to how the studies were conducted or the populations themselves.in the united states, narcolepsy is estimated to affect as many as 200,000 americans, but fewer than 50,000 are diagnosed. the prevalence of narcolepsy is about 1 per 2,000 persons. narcolepsy is often mistaken for depression, epilepsy, the side effects of medications, poor sleeping habits or recreational drug use, making misdiagnosis likely. while narcolepsy symptoms are often confused with depression, there is a link between the two disorders. research studies have mixed results on co-occurrence of depression in people with narcolepsy, as the numbers quoted by different studies are anywhere between 6% and 50%.narcolepsy can occur in both men and women at any age, although typical symptom onset occurs in adolescence and young adulthood. there is about a ten-year delay in diagnosing narcolepsy in adults. cognitive, educational, occupational, and psychosocial problems associated with the excessive daytime sleepiness of narcolepsy have been documented. for these to occur in the crucial teen years when education, development of self-image, and development of occupational choice are taking place is especially devastating. while cognitive impairment does occur, it may only be a reflection of the excessive daytime somnolence.


== society and culture ==

in 2015, it was reported that the british department of health was paying for sodium oxybate medication at a cost of £12,000 a year for 80 people who are taking legal action over problems linked to the use of the pandemrix swine flu vaccine. sodium oxybate is not available to people with narcolepsy through the national health service.


=== name ===
the term ""narcolepsy"" is from the french narcolepsie. the french term was first used in 1880 by jean-baptiste-édouard gélineau, who used the greek νάρκη (narkē), meaning ""numbness"", and λῆψις (lepsis) meaning ""attack"".


== research ==


=== histamine-directed medications ===
it remains to be seen whether h3 antagonists (i.e., compounds such as pitolisant that promote the release of the wakefulness-promoting molecule amine histamine) will be particularly useful as wake-promoting agents. however, usage now does exist in various nations such as in france, united kingdom's (nhs as of september 2016) after being given marketing authorisation by european commission on the advice of the european medicines agency and in the united states by the approval of the food and drug administration (fda) as of august 2019.


=== gaba-directed medications ===
given the possible role of hyper-active gabaa receptors in the primary hypersomnias (narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia), medications that could counteract this activity are being studied to test their potential to improve sleepiness. these currently include clarithromycin and flumazenil.


==== flumazenil ====
flumazenil is the only gabaa receptor antagonist on the market as of jan 2013, and it is currently manufactured only as an intravenous formulation. given its pharmacology, researchers consider it to be a promising medication in the treatment of primary hypersomnias. results of a small, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial were published in november 2012. this research showed that flumazenil provides relief for most people whose csf contains the unknown ""somnogen"" that enhances the function of gabaa receptors, making them more susceptible to the sleep-inducing effect of gaba. for one person, daily administration of flumazenil by sublingual lozenge and topical cream has proven effective for several years. a 2014 case report also showed improvement in primary hypersomnia symptoms after treatment with a continuous subcutaneous flumazenil infusion. the supply of generic flumazenil was initially thought to be too low to meet the potential demand for treatment of primary hypersomnias. however, this scarcity has eased, and dozens of people are now being treated with flumazenil off-label.


==== clarithromycin ====
in a test tube model, clarithromycin (an antibiotic approved by the fda for the treatment of infections) was found to return the function of the gaba system to normal in people with primary hypersomnias. investigators therefore treated a few people with narcolepsy with off-label clarithromycin, and most felt their symptoms improved with this treatment. in order to help further determine whether clarithromycin is truly beneficial for the treatment of narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia, a small, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial was completed in 2012. ""in this pilot study, clarithromycin improved subjective sleepiness in gaba-related hypersomnia. larger trials of longer duration are warranted."" in 2013, a retrospective review evaluating longer-term clarithromycin use showed efficacy in a large percentage of people with gaba-related hypersomnia. “it is important to note that the positive effect of clarithromycin is secondary to a benzodiazepine antagonist-like effect, not its antibiotic effects, and treatment must be maintained.”


=== orexin receptor agonists ===

orexin-a (a.k.a. hypocretin-1) has been shown to be strongly wake-promoting in animal models, but unfortunately it does not cross the blood-brain barrier. therefore, companies have developed orexin receptor antagonists, like suvorexant, for the treatment of insomnia. it is also likely that an orexin-a receptor agonist will be found and developed for the treatment of hypersomnia.in august 2015, nagahara et al published their work in synthesizing the first hcrt/ox2r agonist, compound 26, with good potency and selectivity.


=== l-carnitine ===
abnormally low levels of acylcarnitine have been observed in people with narcolepsy. these same low levels have been associated with primary hypersomnia in general in mouse studies. “mice with systemic carnitine deficiency exhibit a higher frequency of fragmented wakefulness and rapid eye movement (rem) sleep, and reduced locomotor activity.” administration of acetyl-l-carnitine was shown to improve these symptoms in mice. a subsequent human trial found that people with narcolepsy given l-carnitine spent less total time in daytime sleep than people who were given a placebo.


=== animal models ===
animal studies try to mimic the disorder in humans by either modifying the hypocretin/orexin receptors or by eliminating this peptide. an orexin deficit caused by the degeneration of hypothalamic neurons is suggested to be one of the causes of narcolepsy. more recent clinical studies on both animals and humans have also revealed that hypocretin is involved in other functions beside regulation of wakefulness and sleep. these functions include autonomic regulation, emotional processing, reward learning behaviour or energy homeostasis. in studies where the concentration of the hypocretin was measured under different circumstances, it was observed that the hypocretin levels increased with the positive emotion, anger or social interaction but stayed low during sleep or during pain experience.the most reliable and valid animal models developed are the canine (narcoleptic dogs) and the rodent (orexin-deficient mice) ones which helped investigating the narcolepsy and set the focus on the role of orexin in this disorder.


==== dog models ====
dogs, as well as other species like cats or horses, can also exhibit spontaneous narcolepsy with similar symptoms as the one reported in humans. the attacks of cataplexy in dogs can involve partial or full collapse. narcolepsy with cataplexy was identified in a few breeds like labrador retrievers or doberman pinschers where it was investigated the possibility to inherit this disorder in the autosomal recessive mode. according to  a reliable canine model for narcolepsy would be the one in which the narcoleptic symptoms are the result of a mutation in the gene hcrt 2. the animals affected exhibited excessive daytime sleepiness with a reduced state of vigilance and severe cataplexy resulted after palatable food and interactions with the owners or with other animals.


==== rodent models ====
mice that are genetically engineered to lack orexin genes demonstrate many similarities to human narcolepsy. during nocturnal hours, when mice are normally present, those lacking orexin demonstrated murine cataplexy and displayed brain and muscle electrical activity similar to the activity present during rem and nrem sleep. this cataplexy is able to be triggered through social interaction, wheel running, and ultrasonic vocalizations. upon awakening, the mice also display behavior consistent with excessive daytime sleepiness.mice models have also been used to test whether the lack of orexin neurons is correlated with narcolepsy. mice whose orexin neurons have been ablated have shown sleep fragmentation, soremps, and obesity.rat models have been used to demonstrate the association between orexin deficiency and narcoleptic symptoms. rats who lost the majority of their orexinergic neurons exhibited multiple soremps as well as less wakefulness during nocturnal hours, shortened rem latency, and brief periods of cataplexy.

smad2 sequence variant d450e (human),protein,"tumor protein p53, also known as p53, cellular tumor antigen p53 (uniprot name), the guardian of the genome, phosphoprotein p53,  tumor suppressor p53, antigen ny-co-13, or transformation-related protein 53 (trp53), is any isoform of a protein encoded by homologous genes in various organisms, such as tp53 (humans) and trp53 (mice). this homolog (originally thought to be, and often spoken of as, a single protein) is crucial in multicellular vertebrates, where it prevents cancer formation, and thus functions as a tumor suppressor. as such, p53 has been described as ""the guardian of the genome"" because of its role in conserving stability by preventing genome mutation. hence tp53 is classified as a tumor suppressor gene.the name p53 was given in 1979 describing the apparent molecular mass; sds-page analysis indicates that it is a 53-kilodalton (kda) protein. however, the actual mass of the full-length p53 protein (p53α) based on the sum of masses of the amino acid residues is only 43.7 kda. this difference is due to the high number of proline residues in the protein, which slow its migration on sds-page, thus making it appear heavier than it actually is. in addition to the full-length protein, the human tp53 gene encodes at least 15 protein isoforms, ranging in size from 3.5 to 43.7 kda. all these p53 proteins are called the p53 isoforms. the tp53 gene is the most frequently mutated gene (>50%) in human cancer, indicating that the tp53 gene plays a crucial role in preventing cancer formation. tp53 gene encodes proteins that bind to dna and regulate gene expression to prevent mutations of the genome.


== gene ==
in humans, the tp53 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p13.1). the gene spans 20 kb, with a non-coding exon 1 and a very long first intron of 10 kb. the coding sequence contains five regions showing a high degree of conservation in vertebrates, predominantly in exons 2, 5, 6, 7 and 8, but the sequences found in invertebrates show only distant resemblance to mammalian tp53. tp53 orthologs have been identified in most mammals for which complete genome data are available.


=== human tp53 gene ===
in humans, a common polymorphism involves the substitution of an arginine for a proline at codon position 72. many studies have investigated a genetic link between this variation and cancer susceptibility; however, the results have been controversial. for instance, a meta-analysis from 2009 failed to show a link for cervical cancer. a 2011 study found that the tp53 proline mutation did have a profound effect on pancreatic cancer risk among males. a study of arab women found that proline homozygosity at tp53 codon 72 is associated with a decreased risk for breast cancer. one study suggested that tp53 codon 72 polymorphisms, mdm2 snp309, and a2164g may collectively be associated with non-oropharyngeal cancer susceptibility and that mdm2 snp309 in combination with tp53 codon 72 may accelerate the development of non-oropharyngeal cancer in women. a 2011 study found that tp53 codon 72 polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer.meta-analyses from 2011 found no significant associations between tp53 codon 72 polymorphisms and both colorectal cancer risk and endometrial cancer risk. a 2011 study of a brazilian birth cohort found an association between the non-mutant arginine tp53 and individuals without a family history of cancer. another 2011 study found that the p53 homozygous (pro/pro) genotype was associated with a significantly increased risk for renal cell carcinoma.


== structure ==

an acidic n-terminus transcription-activation domain (tad), also known as activation domain 1 (ad1), which activates transcription factors. the n-terminus contains two complementary transcriptional activation domains, with a major one at residues 1–42 and a minor one at residues 55–75, specifically involved in the regulation of several pro-apoptotic genes.
activation domain 2 (ad2) important for apoptotic activity: residues 43–63.
proline rich domain important for the apoptotic activity of p53 by nuclear exportation via mapk: residues 64–92.
central dna-binding core domain (dbd). contains one zinc atom and several arginine amino acids: residues 102–292. this region is responsible for binding the p53 co-repressor lmo3.
nuclear localization signaling (nls) domain, residues 316–325.
homo-oligomerisation domain (od): residues 307–355. tetramerization is essential for the activity of p53 in vivo.
c-terminal involved in downregulation of dna binding of the central domain: residues 356–393.mutations that deactivate p53 in cancer usually occur in the dbd. most of these mutations destroy the ability of the protein to bind to its target dna sequences, and thus prevents transcriptional activation of these genes. as such, mutations in the dbd are recessive loss-of-function mutations. molecules of p53 with mutations in the od dimerise with wild-type p53, and prevent them from activating transcription. therefore, od mutations have a dominant negative effect on the function of p53.
wild-type p53 is a labile protein, comprising folded and unstructured regions that function in a synergistic manner.


== function ==


=== dna damage and repair ===
p53 plays a role in regulation or progression through the cell cycle, apoptosis, and genomic stability by means of several mechanisms:

it can activate dna repair proteins when dna has sustained damage. thus, it may be an important factor in aging.
it can arrest growth by holding the cell cycle at the g1/s regulation point on dna damage recognition—if it holds the cell here for long enough, the dna repair proteins will have time to fix the damage and the cell will be allowed to continue the cell cycle.
it can initiate apoptosis (i.e., programmed cell death) if dna damage proves to be irreparable.
it is essential for the senescence response to short telomeres.
waf1/cip1 encoding for p21 and hundreds of other down-stream genes. p21 (waf1) binds to the g1-s/cdk (cdk4/cdk6, cdk2, and cdk1) complexes (molecules important for the g1/s transition in the cell cycle) inhibiting their activity.
when p21(waf1) is complexed with cdk2, the cell cannot continue to the next stage of cell division. a mutant p53 will no longer bind dna in an effective way, and, as a consequence, the p21 protein will not be available to act as the ""stop signal"" for cell division. studies of human embryonic stem cells (hescs) commonly describe the nonfunctional p53-p21 axis of the g1/s checkpoint pathway with subsequent relevance for cell cycle regulation and the dna damage response (ddr). importantly, p21 mrna is clearly present and upregulated after the ddr in hescs, but p21 protein is not detectable. in this cell type, p53 activates numerous micrornas (like mir-302a, mir-302b, mir-302c, and mir-302d) that directly inhibit the p21 expression in hescs.
the p21 protein binds directly to cyclin-cdk complexes that drive forward the cell cycle and inhibits their kinase activity, thereby causing cell cycle arrest to allow repair to take place. p21 can also mediate growth arrest associated with differentiation and a more permanent growth arrest associated with cellular senescence. the p21 gene contains several p53 response elements that mediate direct binding of the p53 protein, resulting in transcriptional activation of the gene encoding the p21 protein.
the p53 and rb1 pathways are linked via p14arf, raising the possibility that the pathways may regulate each other.p53 expression can be stimulated by uv light, which also causes dna damage. in this case, p53 can initiate events leading to tanning.


=== stem cells ===
levels of p53 play an important role in the maintenance of stem cells throughout development and the rest of human life.
in human embryonic stem cells (hescs)s, p53 is maintained at low inactive levels. this is because activation of p53 leads to rapid differentiation of hescs. studies have shown that knocking out p53 delays differentiation and that adding p53 causes spontaneous differentiation, showing how p53 promotes differentiation of hescs and plays a key role in cell cycle as a differentiation regulator. when p53 becomes stabilized and activated in hescs, it increases p21 to establish a longer g1. this typically leads to abolition of s-phase entry, which stops the cell cycle in g1, leading to differentiation. work in mouse embryonic stem cells has recently shown however that the expression of p53 does not necessarily lead to differentiation.  p53 also activates mir-34a and mir-145, which then repress the hescs pluripotency factors, further instigating differentiation.in adult stem cells, p53 regulation is important for maintenance of stemness in adult stem cell niches. mechanical signals such as hypoxia affect levels of p53 in these niche cells through the hypoxia inducible factors, hif-1α and hif-2α. while hif-1α stabilizes p53, hif-2α suppresses it. suppression of p53 plays important roles in cancer stem cell phenotype, induced pluripotent stem cells and other stem cell roles and behaviors, such as blastema formation. cells with decreased levels of p53 have been shown to reprogram into stem cells with a much greater efficiency than normal cells. papers suggest that the lack of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis gives more cells the chance to be reprogrammed. decreased levels of p53 were also shown to be a crucial aspect of blastema formation in the legs of salamanders. p53 regulation is very important in acting as a barrier between stem cells and a differentiated stem cell state, as well as a barrier between stem cells being functional and being cancerous.


=== other ===
apart from the cellular and molecular effects above, p53 has a tissue-level anticancer effect that works by inhibiting angiogenesis.  as tumors grow they need to recruit new blood vessels to supply them, and p53 inhibits that by (i) interfering with regulators of tumor hypoxia that also affect angiogenesis, such as hif1 and hif2, (ii) inhibiting the production of angiogenic promoting factors, and (iii) directly increasing the production of angiogenesis inhibitors, such as arresten.p53 by regulating leukemia inhibitory factor has been shown to facilitate implantation in the mouse and possibly humans reproduction.


== regulation ==
p53 becomes activated in response to myriad stressors, including but not limited to dna damage (induced by either uv, ir, or chemical agents such as hydrogen peroxide), oxidative stress, osmotic shock, ribonucleotide depletion, and deregulated oncogene expression. this activation is marked by two major events. first, the half-life of the p53 protein is increased drastically, leading to a quick accumulation of p53 in stressed cells. second, a conformational change forces p53 to be activated as a transcription regulator in these cells. the critical event leading to the activation of p53 is the phosphorylation of its n-terminal domain. the n-terminal transcriptional activation domain contains a large number of phosphorylation sites and can be considered as the primary target for protein kinases transducing stress signals.
the protein kinases that are known to target this transcriptional activation domain of p53 can be roughly divided into two groups. a first group of protein kinases belongs to the mapk family (jnk1-3, erk1-2, p38 mapk), which is known to respond to several types of stress, such as membrane damage, oxidative stress, osmotic shock, heat shock, etc. a second group of protein kinases (atr, atm, chk1 and chk2, dna-pk, cak, tp53rk) is implicated in the genome integrity checkpoint, a molecular cascade that detects and responds to several forms of dna damage caused by genotoxic stress. oncogenes also stimulate p53 activation, mediated by the protein p14arf.
in unstressed cells, p53 levels are kept low through a continuous degradation of p53. a protein called mdm2 (also called hdm2 in humans), binds to p53, preventing its action and transports it from the nucleus to the cytosol. mdm2 also acts as an ubiquitin ligase and covalently attaches ubiquitin to p53 and thus marks p53 for degradation by the proteasome. however, ubiquitylation of p53 is reversible. on activation of p53, mdm2 is also activated, setting up a feedback loop. p53 levels can show oscillations (or repeated pulses) in response to certain stresses, and these pulses can be important in determining whether the cells survive the stress, or die.mi-63 binds to mdm2, reactivating p53 in situations where p53's function has become inhibited.a ubiquitin specific protease, usp7 (or hausp), can cleave ubiquitin off p53, thereby protecting it from proteasome-dependent  degradation via the ubiquitin ligase pathway . this is one means by which p53 is stabilized in response to oncogenic insults. usp42 has also been shown to deubiquitinate p53 and may be required for the ability of p53 to respond to stress.recent research has shown that hausp is mainly localized in the nucleus, though a fraction of it can be found in the cytoplasm and mitochondria. overexpression of hausp results in p53 stabilization. however, depletion of hausp does not result to a decrease in p53 levels but rather increases p53 levels due to the fact that hausp binds and deubiquitinates mdm2. it has been shown that hausp is a better binding partner to mdm2 than p53 in unstressed cells.
usp10 however has been shown to be located in the cytoplasm in unstressed cells and deubiquitinates cytoplasmic p53, reversing mdm2 ubiquitination. following dna damage, usp10 translocates to the nucleus and contributes to p53 stability. also usp10 does not interact with mdm2.phosphorylation of the n-terminal end of p53 by the above-mentioned protein kinases disrupts mdm2-binding. other proteins, such as pin1, are then recruited to p53 and induce a conformational change in p53, which prevents mdm2-binding even more. phosphorylation also allows for binding of transcriptional coactivators, like p300 and pcaf, which then acetylate the carboxy-terminal end of p53, exposing the dna binding domain of p53, allowing it to activate or repress specific genes. deacetylase enzymes, such as sirt1 and sirt7, can deacetylate p53, leading to an inhibition of apoptosis. some oncogenes can also stimulate the transcription of proteins that bind to mdm2 and inhibit its activity.


== role in disease ==

if the tp53 gene is damaged, tumor suppression is severely compromised. people who inherit only one functional copy of the tp53 gene will most likely develop tumors in early adulthood, a disorder known as li-fraumeni syndrome.
the tp53 gene can also be modified by mutagens (chemicals, radiation, or viruses), increasing the likelihood for uncontrolled cell division. more than 50 percent of human tumors contain a mutation or deletion of the tp53 gene. loss of p53 creates genomic instability that most often results in an aneuploidy phenotype.increasing the amount of p53 may seem a solution for treatment of tumors or prevention of their spreading. this, however, is not a usable method of treatment, since it can cause premature aging. restoring endogenous normal p53 function holds some promise. research has shown that this restoration can lead to regression of certain cancer cells without damaging other cells in the process. the ways by which tumor regression occurs depends mainly on the tumor type. for example, restoration of endogenous p53 function in lymphomas may induce apoptosis, while cell growth may be reduced to normal levels. thus, pharmacological reactivation of p53 presents itself as a viable cancer treatment option. the first commercial gene therapy, gendicine, was approved in china in 2003 for the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. it delivers a functional copy of the p53 gene using an engineered adenovirus.certain pathogens can also affect the p53 protein that the tp53 gene expresses. one such example, human papillomavirus (hpv), encodes a protein, e6, which binds to the p53 protein and inactivates it. this mechanism, in synergy with the inactivation of the cell cycle regulator prb by the hpv protein e7, allows for repeated cell division manifested clinically as warts. certain hpv types, in particular types 16 and 18, can also lead to progression from a benign wart to low or high-grade cervical dysplasia, which are reversible forms of precancerous lesions. persistent infection of the cervix over the years can cause irreversible changes leading to carcinoma in situ and eventually invasive cervical cancer. this results from the effects of hpv genes, particularly those encoding e6 and e7, which are the two viral oncoproteins that are preferentially retained and expressed in cervical cancers by integration of the viral dna into the host genome.the p53 protein is continually produced and degraded in cells of healthy people, resulting in damped oscillation. the degradation of the p53 protein is associated with binding of mdm2. in a negative feedback loop, mdm2 itself is induced by the p53 protein. mutant p53 proteins often fail to induce mdm2, causing p53 to accumulate at very high levels. moreover, the mutant p53 protein itself can inhibit normal p53 protein levels. in some cases, single missense mutations in p53 have been shown to disrupt p53 stability and function.suppression of p53 in human breast cancer cells is shown to lead to increased cxcr5 chemokine receptor gene expression and activated cell migration in response to chemokine cxcl13.one study found that p53 and myc proteins were key to the survival of chronic myeloid leukaemia (cml) cells. targeting p53 and myc proteins with drugs gave positive results on mice with cml.


== experimental analysis of p53 mutations ==
most p53 mutations are detected by dna sequencing. however, it is known that single missense mutations can have a large spectrum from rather mild to very severe functional affects.the large spectrum of cancer phenotypes due to mutations in the tp53 gene is also supported by the fact that different isoforms of p53 proteins have different cellular mechanisms for prevention against cancer. mutations in tp53 can give rise to different isoforms, preventing their overall functionality in different cellular mechanisms and thereby extending the cancer phenotype from mild to severe. recents studies show that p53 isoforms are differentially expressed in different human tissues, and the loss-of-function or gain-of-function mutations within the isoforms can cause tissue-specific cancer or provides cancer stem cell potential in different tissues. tp53 mutation also hits energy metabolism and increases glycolysis in breast cancer cells.the dynamics of p53 proteins, along with its antagonist mdm2, indicate that the levels of p53, in units of concentration, oscillate as a function of time. this ""damped"" oscillation is both clinically documented  and mathematically modelled. mathematical models also indicate that the p53 concentration oscillates much faster once teratogens, such as double-stranded breaks (dsb) or uv radiation, are introduced to the system. this supports and models the current understanding of p53 dynamics, where dna damage induces p53 activation (see p53 regulation for more information). current models can also be useful for modelling the mutations in p53 isoforms and their effects on p53 oscillation, thereby promoting de novo tissue-specific pharmacological drug discovery.


== discovery ==
p53 was identified in 1979 by lionel crawford, david p. lane, arnold levine, and lloyd old, working at imperial cancer research fund (uk) princeton university/umdnj (cancer institute of new jersey), and memorial sloan-kettering cancer center, respectively. it had been hypothesized to exist before as the target of the sv40 virus, a strain that induced development of tumors. the tp53 gene from the mouse was first cloned by peter chumakov of the academy of sciences of the ussr in 1982, and independently in 1983 by moshe oren in collaboration with david givol (weizmann institute of science). the human tp53 gene was cloned in 1984 and the full length clone in 1985.it was initially presumed to be an oncogene due to the use of mutated cdna following purification of tumor cell mrna. its role as a tumor suppressor gene was revealed in 1989 by bert vogelstein at the johns hopkins school of medicine and arnold levine at princeton university.warren maltzman, of the waksman institute of rutgers university first demonstrated that tp53 was responsive to dna damage in the form of ultraviolet radiation. in a series of publications in 1991–92, michael kastan of johns hopkins university, reported that tp53 was a critical part of a signal transduction pathway that helped cells respond to dna damage.in 1993, p53 was voted molecule of the year by science magazine.


== isoforms ==
as with 95% of human genes, tp53 encodes more than one protein. several isoforms were discovered in 2005, and so far 12 human p53 isoforms have been identified (p53α, p53β, p53γ, ∆40p53α, ∆40p53β, ∆40p53γ, ∆133p53α, ∆133p53β, ∆133p53γ, ∆160p53α, ∆160p53β, ∆160p53γ). furthermore, p53 isoforms are expressed in a tissue dependent manner and p53α is never expressed alone.the full length p53 isoform proteins can be subdivided into different protein domains. starting from the n-terminus, there are first the amino-terminal transactivation domains (tad 1, tad 2), which are needed to induce a subset of p53 target genes. this domain is followed by the proline rich domain (pxxp), whereby the motif pxxp is repeated (p is a proline and x can be any amino acid). it is required among others for p53 mediated apoptosis. some isoforms lack the proline rich domain, such as δ133p53β,γ and δ160p53α,β,γ; hence some isoforms of p53 are not mediating apoptosis, emphasizing the diversifying roles of the tp53 gene. afterwards there is the dna binding domain (dbd), which enables the proteins to sequence specific binding. the carboxyl terminal domain completes the protein. it includes the nuclear localization signal (nls), the nuclear export signal (nes) and the oligomerisation domain (od). the nls and nes are responsible for the subcellular regulation of p53. through the od, p53 can form a tetramer and then bind to dna. among the isoforms, some domains can be missing, but all of them share most of the highly conserved dna-binding domain.
the isoforms are formed by different mechanisms. the beta and the gamma isoforms are generated by multiple splicing of intron 9, which leads to a different c-terminus. furthermore, the usage of an internal promoter in intron 4 causes the ∆133 and ∆160 isoforms, which lack the tad domain and a part of the dbd. moreover, alternative initiation of translation at codon 40 or 160 bear the ∆40p53 and ∆160p53 isoforms.due to the isoformic nature of p53 proteins, there have been several sources of evidence showing that mutations within the tp53 gene giving rise to mutated isoforms are causative agents of various cancer phenotypes, from mild to severe, due to single mutation in the tp53 gene (refer to section experimental analysis of p53 mutations for more details).

its melting point may vary depending on the compound type and the source consulted. for example, the merck index gives a melting point of 155-156 celsius for the a1 type while the japanese pharmacopoeia reports 153-158 celsius. the merck index also gives a melting point of 122-125 celsius for the a3 type."
dapsone,antibiotic,"dapsone, also known as diaminodiphenyl sulfone (dds), is an antibiotic commonly used in combination with rifampicin and clofazimine for the treatment of leprosy. it is a second-line medication for the treatment and prevention of pneumocystis pneumonia and for the prevention of toxoplasmosis in those who have poor immune function. additionally, it has been used for acne, dermatitis herpetiformis, and various other skin conditions. dapsone is available both topically and by mouth.severe side effects may include a decrease in blood cells, red blood cell breakdown especially in those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (g-6-pd), or hypersensitivity. common side effects include nausea and loss of appetite. other side effects include liver inflammation and a number of types of skin rashes. while the safety of use during pregnancy is not entirely clear some physicians recommend that it be continued in those with leprosy. it is of the sulfone class.dapsone was first studied as an antibiotic in 1937. its use for leprosy began in 1945. it is on the world health organization's list of essential medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. the form, which is taken by mouth, is available as a generic drug and not very expensive.


== medical uses ==


=== infections ===
dapsone is commonly used in combination with rifampicin and clofazimine for the treatment of leprosy. it is also used to both treat and prevent pneumocystis pneumonia (pcp). it is also used for toxoplasmosis in people unable to tolerate trimethoprim with sulfamethoxazole.dapsone by mouth was one of the first medications used to treat moderate to severe acne vulgaris, and is still occasionally prescribed for the treatment of severe cases. a topical form of dapsone is also effective with potentially less side effects.it is unclear if the combination with pyrimethamine is useful in the prevention of malaria.


=== autoimmune disease ===
cutaneous lupus erythematosis. dapsone is effective and safe in persons with moderate, severe, or refractory cutaneous lupus erythematosis.
idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. dapsone is effective and safe for adjunctive glucocorticoid-sparing treatment of persons with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and is preferred over danazol or interferon alpha in those people with antinuclear antibodies.
chronic spontaneous urticaria. dapsone is effective and safe for treatment of second-line therapy for people with chronic spontaneous urticaria in those for whom antihistamines and other first-line agents have failed.
relapsing polychondritis. there are no clinical trials but there are many case reports that dapsone is effective at doses of 25 mg/day to 200 mg/day for treatment of relapsing polychondritis.


=== other ===
dermatitis herpetiformis in combination with a gluten-free diet.dapsone may be used to treat brown recluse spider bites that become necrotic.dapsone is the recommended treatment for erythema elevatum diutinum, as a review found that using oral dapsone alone was effective in 80% of early cases of the disease. however, dapsone can potentially cause severe side effects, meaning that sometimes steroids or other antibiotics should be used instead, although these alternative treatments are much less effective.an august 2015 review notes that dapsone is reported to be effective against generalized granuloma annulare.dapsone has been used as a monomer in the design of dye adsorbent polymers.


== contraindications and precautions ==
people with porphyria, anemia, cardiac disease, lung disease, hiv infection, g6pd deficiency, and liver impairment are at higher risks of adverse effects when using dapsone.
recommend using pulse oximeter 2x/day to monitor for methemoglobinemia.


== adverse effects ==
hypersensitivity reactions occur in 1.4% of persons treated with dapsone, and can be fatal in medical settings with low resources. it is a form of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (scars) in which a scars disorder, primarily the dress syndrome or a dress syndrome-like reaction occurs.


=== blood ===
the most prominent side-effects of this drug are dose-related hemolysis (which may lead to hemolytic anemia) and methemoglobinemia. about 20% of patients treated with dapsone suffer hemolysis and the side-effect is more common and severe in those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, leading to the dapsone-containing antimalarial combination lapdap being withdrawn from clinical use. a case of hemolysis in a neonate from dapsone in breast milk has been reported. agranulocytosis occurs rarely when dapsone is used alone but more frequently in combination regimens for malaria prophylaxis. abnormalities in white blood cell formation, including aplastic anemia, are rare, yet are the cause of the majority of deaths attributable to dapsone therapy.


=== liver ===
toxic hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported by the manufacturer. these toxic reactions may also occur as part of the dapsone hypersensitivity syndrome (a form of scars-see above) or dapsone syndrome (see below). dapsone is metabolized by the cytochrome p450 system, specifically isozymes cyp2d6, cyp2b6, cyp3a4, and cyp2c19. dapsone metabolites produced by the cytochrome p450 2c19 isozyme are associated with the methemoglobinemia side effect of the drug.


=== skin ===
when used topically, dapsone can cause mild skin irritation, redness, dry skin, burning, and itching. when used together with benzoyl peroxide products, temporary yellow or orange skin discolorations can occur.


=== other adverse effects ===
other adverse effects include nausea, headache, and rash (which are common), and insomnia, psychosis, and peripheral neuropathy. effects on the lung occur rarely and may be serious, though are generally reversible.


=== dapsone syndrome ===
hypersensitivity reactions occur in some patients. this reaction may be more frequent in patients receiving multiple-drug therapy.the reaction always involves a rash, may also include fever, jaundice, and eosinophilia, and is likely to be one manifestation of the scars reaction viz., the dress syndrome (see above). in general, these symptoms will occur within the first six weeks of therapy or not at all, and may be ameliorated by corticosteroid therapy.


== mechanism of action ==
as an antibacterial, dapsone inhibits bacterial synthesis of dihydrofolic acid, via competition with para-aminobenzoate for the active site of dihydropteroate synthase, thereby inhibiting nucleic acid synthesis. though structurally distinct from dapsone, the sulfonamide group of antibacterial drugs also work in this way.
as an anti-inflammatory, dapsone inhibits the myeloperoxidase-h2o2-halide-mediated cytotoxic system in polymorphonucleocytes. as part of the respiratory burst that neutrophils use to kill bacteria, myeloperoxidase converts hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) into hypochlorous acid (hocl). hocl is the most potent oxidant generated by neutrophils, and can cause significant tissue damage during inflammation. dapsone arrests myeloperoxidase in an inactive intermediate form, reversibly inhibiting the enzyme.  this prevents accumulation of hypochlorous acid, and reduces tissue damage during inflammation. myeloperoxidase inhibition has also been suggested as a neuron-sparing mechanism for reducing inflammation in neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer's disease and stroke.dapsone's anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects are thought to be its mechanism of action in treating dermatitis herpetiformis.dapsone is an odorless white to creamy-white crystalline powder with a slightly bitter taste.


== history ==


=== discovery ===

in the early 20th century, the german chemist paul ehrlich was developing theories of selective toxicity based largely on the ability of certain dyes to kill microbes. gerhard domagk, who would later win a nobel prize for his efforts, made a major breakthrough in 1932 with the discovery of the antibacterial prontosil red (sulfonamidochrysoidine). further investigation into the involved chemicals opened the way to sulfa drug and sulfone therapy, first with the discovery of sulfanilamide, the active agent of prontosil, by daniel bovet and his team at pasteur institute (1935), then with that of dapsone independently by ernest fourneau in france and gladwin buttle in the united kingdom.


=== proposed use in antimalarial drugs ===
the spread of drug-resistant malaria in africa has encouraged the development of new, low-cost antimalarial drugs. plasmodium falciparum, one of the plasmodium species that causes malaria, has developed resistance both to chloroquine and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, two of the most common treatments for malaria. artemisinin, another antimalarial drug, had been developed in the 1980s but was too expensive for large-scale use. this led glaxosmithkline to develop lapdap, a combination drug consisting of chlorproguanil and dapsone. lapdap was licensed in the united kingdom starting in october 2003.one advantage of lapdap was that chlorproguanil and dapsone are both low-cost drugs. another was that by virtue of being a combination drug, it was less likely to cause drug resistance. however, because dapsone causes hemolytic anemia in patients with g6pd deficiency, and because g6pd deficiency affects 10-25% of the population of sub-saharan africa, it was discovered that lapdap is not safe for use in africa. it was available in many african countries for four years before glaxosmithkline took it off the market in february 2008.


=== dapsone gel ===
dapsone had been reported in a few cases to effectively treat acne, but the risk of hemolytic anemia kept it from being widely used for this purpose. for many years scientists attempted to develop a topical formulation of dapsone that would be as effective against acne as oral dapsone, but without the hemolysis side effect. this was difficult to accomplish because dapsone is highly insoluble in aqueous solvents. in the early 2000s qlt usa developed aczone, a 5% dapsone gel that was shown to be effective against acne without causing clinically significant declines in hemoglobin levels, even in subjects with g6pd deficiency.  in february 2016, the fda approved a 7.5% dapsone gel.  this higher strength has the advantage of a once-daily application, versus twice-daily application of the 5% formulation.


== other uses ==
dapsone also find uses as a curing agent in the manufacture of paints, adhesives, composites, powder coats and printed circuit boards.

dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide--protein glycosyltransferase subunit 4,protein,"in molecular biology, ost4 (dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide—protein glycosyltransferase subunit 4) is a subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex.
ost4 is a very short, approximately 30 amino acids, protein found from fungi to vertebrates. it appears to be an integral membrane protein that mediates the en bloc transfer of a pre-assembled high-mannose oligosaccharide onto asparagine residues of nascent polypeptides as they enter the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

transcription initiation factor tfiid subunit 12 isoform htafii20 (human),protein,"transcription factor p65 also known as nuclear factor nf-kappa-b p65 subunit is a protein that in humans is encoded by the rela gene.rela, also known as p65, is a rel-associated protein involved in nf-κb heterodimer formation, nuclear translocation and activation. nf-κb is an essential transcription factor complex involved in all types of cellular processes, including cellular metabolism, chemotaxis, etc. phosphorylation and acetylation of rela are crucial post-translational modifications required for nf-κb activation. rela has also been shown to modulate immune responses, and activation of rela is positively associated with multiple types of cancer.


== gene and expression ==
rela, or v-rel avian reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog a, is also known as p65 or nfkb3. it is located on chromosome 11 q13, and its nucleotide sequence is 1473 nucleotide long. rela protein has four isoforms, the longest and the predominant one being 551 amino acids. rela is expressed alongside p50 in various cell types, including epithelial/endothelial cells and neuronal tissues.


== structure ==
rela is one member of the nf-κb family, one of the essential transcription factors under intensive study. seven proteins encoded by five genes are involved in the nf-κb complex, namely p105, p100, p50, p52, rela, c-rel and relb. like other proteins in this complex, rela contains a n-terminal rel-homology domain (rhd), and also a c-terminal transactivation domain (tad). rhd is involved in dna binding, dimerization and nf-κb/rel inhibitor interaction. on the other hand, tad is responsible for interacting with the basal transcription complex including many coactivators of transcription such as tbp, tfiib and creb-cbp. rela and p50 is the mostly commonly found heterodimer complex among nf-κb homodimers and heterodimers, and is the functional component participating in nuclear translocation and activation of nf-κb.
rela is a 65 kda protein.


=== phosphorylation ===
phosphorylation of rela plays a key role in regulating nf-κb activation and function. subsequent to nf-κb nuclear translocation, rela undergoes site-specific post-translational modifications to further enhance the nf-κb function as a transcription factor. rela can either be phosphorylated in the rhd region or the tad region, attracting different interaction partners. triggered by lipopolysaccharide (lps), protein kinase a (pka) specifically phosphorylates serine 276 in the rhd domain in the cytoplasm, controlling nf-κb dna-binding and oligomerization. on the other hand, mitogen and stress-activated kinase 1 (msk1) are also able to phosphorylate rela at residue 276 under tnfα induction in the nucleus, increasing nf-κb response at the transcriptional level. phosphorylation of serine 311 by protein kinase c zeta type (pkcζ) serves the same purpose.
two residues in the tad region are targeted by phosphorylation. after il-1or tnfα stimulation, serine 529 is phosphorylated by casein kinase ii (ckii), while serine 536 is phosphorylated by iκb kinases (ikks). in response to dna damage, ribosomal subunit kinase-1 (rsk1) also has the ability to phosphorylate rela at serine 536 in a p53-dependent manner. a couple of other kinases are also able to phosphorylate rela at different conditions, including glycogen-synthase kinase-3β (gsk3β), akt/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k) and nf-κb activating kinase (nak, i.e. tank-binding kinase-1 (tbk1) and traf2-associated kinase (t2k)). the fact that rela can be modified by a collection of kinases via phosphorylation at different sites/regions within the protein under different stimulations might suggest a synergistic effect of these modifications. 
phosphorylation at these sites enhances nf-κb transcriptional response via tightened binding to transcription coactivators. for example, cbp and p300 binding to rela are enhanced when serine 276 or 311 is phosphorylated.
status of several phosphorylation sites determines rela stability mediated by the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. cell-type-specific phosphorylation is also observed for rela. multiple-site phosphorylation is common in endothelial cells, and different cell types may contain different stimuli, leading to targeted phosphorylation of rela by different kinases. for instance, ikk2 is found to be mainly responsible for phosphorylating serine 536 in monocytes and macrophages, or in cd40 receptor binding in hepatic stellate cells. ikk1 functions as the major kinase phosphorylating serine 536 under different stimuli, such as the ligand activation of the lymphotoxin-β receptor (ltβr).


=== acetylation ===
in vivo studies revealed that rela is also under acetylation modification in the nucleus, which is just as important as phosphorylation as a post-translational modification of proteins. 
lysines 218, 221 and 310 are acetylation targets within rela, and response to acetylation is site-specific. for instance, lysine 221 acetylation facilitates rela dissociation from iκbα and enhances its dna-binding affinity. lysine 310 acetylation is indispensable for the full transcriptional activity of rela, but does not affect its dna-binding ability. hypothesis about rela acetylation suggests acetylation aids its subsequent recognition by transcriptional co-activators with bromodomains, which are specialized in recognizing acetylated lysine residues. lysine 122 and 123 acetylation are found to be negatively correlated with rela transcriptional activation. 
unknown mechanisms mediate the acetylation of rela possibly using p300/cbp and p300/cbp factor associated coactivators under tnfα or phorbol myristate acetate (pmf) stimulation both in vivo and in vitro. rela is also under the control of deacetylation via hdac, and hdac3 is the mediator of this process both in vivo and in vitro.


=== methylation ===
methylation of lysine 218 and 221 together or lysine 37 alone in the rhd domain of rela can lead to increased response to cytokines such as il-1 in mammalian cell culture.


== interactions ==
as the prototypical heterodimer complex member of the nf-κb, together with p50, rela/p65 interacts with various proteins in both the cytoplasm and in the nucleus during the process of classical nf-κb activation and nuclear translocation. in the inactive state, rela/p50 complex is mainly sequestered by iκbα in the cytosol. tnfα, lps and other factors serve as activation inducers, followed by phosphorylation at residue 32 and 36 of iκbα, leading to rapid degradation of iκbα via the ubiquitin-proteasomal system and subsequent release of rela/p50 complex. rela nuclear localization signal used to be sequestered by iκbα is now exposed, and rapid translocation of the nf-κb occurs. in parallel, there is a non-classical nf-κb activation pathway involving the proteolytic cleavage of p100 into p52 instead of p50. this process does not require rela, hence will not be discussed in detail here. 
after nf-κb nuclear localization due to tnfα stimulation, p50/rela heterodimer will function as a transcription factor and bind to a variety of genes involved in all kinds of biological processes, such as leukocyte activation/chemotaxis, negative regulation of tnfikk pathway, cellular metabolism, antigen processing, just to name a few . 
phosphorylation of rela at different residues also enables its interaction with cdks and p-tefb. phosphorylation at serine 276 in rela allows its interaction with p-tefb containing cdk9 and cyclin t1 subunits, and phospho-ser276 rela-p-tefb complex is necessary for il-8 and gro-β activation. another mechanism is involved in the activation of genes preloaded with pol ii in a rela serine 276 phosphorylation independent manner.
rela has been shown to interact with:


== role in immune system ==
gene knockout of nf-κb genes via homologous recombination in mice showed the role of these components in innate and adaptive immune responses. rela knockout mice is embryonic lethal due to liver apoptosis. lymphocyte activation failure is also observed, suggesting that rela is indispensable in the proper development of the immune system. in comparison, deletion of other rel-related genes will not cause embryonic development failure, though different levels of defects are also noted. the fact that cytokines such as tnfα and il-1 can stimulate the activation of rela also supports its participation in immune response. 
in general, rela participates in adaptive immunity and responses to invading pathogens via nf-κb activation. mice without individual nf-κb proteins are deficient in b- and t-cell activation and proliferation, cytokine production and isotype switching. mutations in rela is found responsible for inflammatory bowel disease as well.


== cancer ==
nf-κb/rela activation has been found to be correlated with cancer development, suggesting the potential of rela as a cancer biomarker. specific modification patterns of rela have also been observed in many cancer types.


=== prostate ===
rela may have a potential role as biomarker for prostate cancer progression and metastases, as suggested by the association found between rela nuclear localization and prostate cancer aggressiveness and biochemical recurrence.


=== thyroid ===
strong correlation between nuclear localization of rela and clinicopathological parameters for papillary thyroid carcinoma (ptc), suggesting the role of nf-κb activation in tumor growth and aggressiveness in ptc. 
other than usage as an biomarker, serine 536 phosphorylation in rela is also correlated with nuclear translocation and the expression of some transactivating genes such as cox-2, il-8 and gst-pi in follicular thyroid carcinomas via morphoproteomic analysis.


=== leukemia ===
mutations in the transactivation domain of rela can lead to decrease in transactivating ability and this mutation can be found in lymphoid neoplasia.


=== head and neck ===
nuclear localization of nf-κb/rela is positively correlated with tumor micrometastases into lymph and blood and negatively correlated with patient survival outcome in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc). this suggests a role of nf-κb/rela as a possible target for targeted-therapy.


=== breast ===
there is both a physical and a functional association between rela and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (ahr), and the subsequent activation of c-myc gene transcription in breast cancer cells. another paper reported interactions between estrogen receptor (er) and nf-κb members, including p50 and rela. it is shown that erα interacts with both p50 and rela in vitro and in vivo, and rela antibody can reduce erα:ere complex formation. the paper claims a mutual repression between er and nf-κb.


=== monogenic behçet’s disease-like conditions ===
behçet's disease-like conditions are increasingly recognized and to date predominantly involve loss-of-function variants in tnfaip3. however, a rela mutation that results in truncated protein variant has been reported  to cause severe autoinflammatory disease due to impaired nf-κb signaling and increased apoptosis. the phenotypes associated with this disease include mucocutaneous ulcerative syndrome and neuromyelitis optica (nmo).

amniotic epithelial stem cell,cell,"an amniotic epithelial cell is a form of stem cell extracted from the lining of the inner membrane of the placenta.  amniotic epithelial cells start to develop around 8 days post fertilization. these cells are known to have some of the same markers as embryonic stem cells, more specifically, oct-4 and nanog. these transcription factors are the basis of the pluripotency of stem cells. amniotic epithelial cells have the ability to develop into any of the three germ layers: endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. they can develop into several organ tissues specific to these germ layers including heart, brain, and liver.  the pluripotency of the human amniotic epithelial cells makes them useful in treating and fighting diseases and disorders of the nervous system as well as other tissues of the human body.  artificial heart valves and working tracheas, as well as muscle, fat, bone, heart, neural and liver cells have all been engineered using amniotic stem cells. tissues obtained from amniotic cell lines show promise for patients suffering from congenital diseases or malformations of the heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, and cerebral tissue.


== transplantation ==
amniotic epithelial cells have shown to be safe and successfully transplanted into hosts that are not related to the donor. one possible reason for this is that amniotic epithelial cells have low antigen levels that inhibit compatibility from a donor to the recipient. this makes the possibility of rejection of the cells by the recipient tissue less likely. unlike traditional tissue transplants, where the donor and recipient have to be in complete sync as far as blood type and overall compatibility and even still can show tissue rejection, amniotic epithelial cells can be used and show a higher likelihood of tissue acceptance. also, amniotic epithelial cells are known to promote natural wound healing as well as the inhibition of angiogenesis, which is the basic conversion of a tumor into malignant cancer.


== advantages over embryonic stem cells ==
in harvesting embryonic stem cells, a human embryo is destroyed.  many anti-abortion individuals associate this act with abortion and consider it immoral.  amniotic epithelial cells are harvested from the placenta, which is commonly discarded after birth. the cells are very easily obtainable without the use of intrusive procedures. thus their use averts the controversy about embryonic stem cells. there are also large amounts of amniotic epithelial cells found in the placenta and can be found in upwards of 50-100 million cells from one extraction. however, several billion cells are required to use for transplantation in order to treat and fight diseases. therefore, the cells must be expanded in a lab to have enough cells for transplantation.
unlike embryonic stem cells, amniotic stem cells have not shown a propensity for developing into teratomas and other cancer-like tumors upon injection into living tissue. amniotic epithelial cells have not been known to produce cancerous tumors in the host despite the fact that these cells do express genes found in embryonic stem cells that are known to promote tumor formation.
organs engineered from amniotic epithelial cells obtained from the placenta associated with a particular person's birth would not be rejected by that person; such organs would have the same genotype as that person and thus be fully compatible with that person's immune system.


== expansion ==
because there is not a sufficient amount of amniotic epithelial cells extracted from a single term placenta to be use in cellular therapies, the cells must be expanded in a lab. however, some studies have shown that once these cells are duplicated in the lab, some of the pluripotency is lost. also, these lab grown cells have shown altered gene expression causing a differing phenotype as well as differing antigen levels. this may change their ability to be compatible across non related tissues. much of the effects of expanding these cells are unknown and scientists are continuing to study ways to cultivate these cells without changing their pluripotent properties.
scientists have found that freezing amniotic epithelial cells causes them to not function as they normally would, which have scientists thinking that the extracellular matrix is the part of the cell that controls its functions.


== cellular therapies ==
there have been several studies conducted on the potential benefits of using amniotic epithelial cells in various parts of the body. one prospective use of these cells includes cellular therapies aimed at dropping inflammation and scarring. models have shown that using these cells to reduce such inflammation has shown rewarding affects in the lungs and liver. more specifically, amniotic epithelial cells have been used in the past to treat genetic liver diseases such as ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, familial hypercholesterolemia, and crigler–najjar syndrome. these cells are being looked at by scientists as a new and more efficient way to treat diseases of the liver particularly because of the problem arising from a lack of liver donors. scientists are also working with genetically modified human amniotic epithelial cells in new experimental procedures and cellular therapies.
also, amniotic epithelial cells have shown potential for encouraging tissue repair of the recipient. studies have shown that the use of amniotic epithelial cells in cellular therapies involving spinal cord injuries is promising because of their ability to differentiate into fully operational neurons and can release neurotransmitters. these cells can also be used to treat diseases that affect the central nervous system as well as other neurological disorders.
amniotic epithelial cells are able to make and release acetylcholine and catecholamine. they also show gene expression for dopamine receptors and transporters. because of this, they are also studied by scientists who research effects of new drugs on dopamine receptors and transporters as well as the basic functions including dopamine secretion and uptake.
several scientists have concluded using lab rats with parkinson's disease that these cells, when transplanted, reversed the effects of the disease by replacing those dopamine releasing neurons that had died and prevented other neurons from being destroyed by the disease. currently, parkinson's disease is treated with dopamine replacement therapy but is not functional with the late progression of the disease and can't cure the disease. also, other cells that have been used in the past for transplantation to treat parkinson's, such as neural stem cells and embryonic stem cells, are either limited or controversial in their retrieval. similar positive effects have also been shown in studies involving chickens with neurological disorders.
experiments with lab mice have concluded that amniotic epithelial cells can also differentiate into cells of the pancreas that function to produce insulin and regulate blood sugar levels. this could be a possible cure or treatment for diabetes of both types.
these stem cells can also be used in the lung because they are able to differentiate into cells that produce surfactant, which promotes lung development in unborn fetuses. this could be used as treatment for babies born prematurely that have underdeveloped lung capacities. another promising use of amniotic epithelial cells is to apply them to the cornea to restore its function in individuals with cornea failure. studies have shown that when these cells are applied, it decreases the swelling of the ocular plane. amniotic epithelial cells have also shown positive effects when used to treat severe burn victims by encouraging tissue repair of the recipient as well as treatment for certain autoimmune diseases.
researchers from the kyoto prefectural university of medicine recently conducted a study in which they transplanted amniotic epithelial cells into the oral cavity to treat oral mucosal defects. because skin grafts taken from the oral cavity cause defects on the donor site, scientists were looking for a better way of treating these defects without creating defects from transplantation. these scientists used lab rabbits with the oral mucosal defects and transplanted cultured amniotic epithelial cells to the defected areas. the cultured amniotic epithelial cells showed markers found on the oral mucosal cells such as certain keratins. they found that the amniotic epithelial cells differentiation into mucosal-like cells and remained on the mucosal defect and therefore could be a possible mechanism for treating those defects. scientists have recently discovered that human amniotic epithelial cells are able to produce and release the plasma protein albumin.

c-c motif chemokine 7,protein,"c-c chemokine receptor type 7 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ccr7 gene. two ligands have been identified for this receptor: the chemokines (c-c motif) ligand 19 (ccl19/elc) and (c-c motif) ligand 21 (ccl21).ccr7 has also recently been designated cd197 (cluster of differentiation 197).


== function ==
the protein encoded by this gene is a member of the g protein-coupled receptor family. this receptor was identified as a gene induced by the epstein-barr virus (ebv), and is thought to be a mediator of ebv effects on b lymphocytes. this receptor is expressed in various lymphoid tissues and activates b and t lymphocytes. ccr7 has been shown to stimulate dendritic cell maturation. ccr7 is also involved in homing of t cells to various secondary lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes and the spleen as well as trafficking of t cells within the spleen.activation of dendritic cells in peripheral tissues induces ccr7 expression on the cell's surface, which recognize ccl19 and ccl21 produced in the lymph node and increases dendritic cell expression of co-stimulation molecules (b7), and mhc class i or mhc class ii.

ergotamine / propyphenazone rectal suppository,drug,"tramadol, sold under the brand name ultram among others, is an opioid pain medication used to treat moderate to moderately severe pain. when taken by mouth in an immediate-release formulation, the onset of pain relief usually begins within an hour. it is also available by injection. it may be sold in combination with paracetamol (acetaminophen) or as longer-acting formulations.as is typical of opioids, common side effects include constipation, itchiness, and nausea. serious side effects may include seizures, increased risk of serotonin syndrome, decreased alertness, and drug addiction. a change in dosage may be recommended in those with kidney or liver problems. it is not recommended in those who are at risk of suicide or in those who are pregnant. while not recommended in women who are breastfeeding, those who take a single dose should not generally stop breastfeeding. tramadol is converted in the liver to o-desmethyltramadol (desmetramadol), an opioid with stronger binding to the μ-opioid receptor. tramadol is also a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (snri).tramadol was patented in 1963 and launched under the name ""tramal"" in 1977 by the west german pharmaceutical company grünenthal gmbh. in the mid-1990s, it was approved in the united kingdom and the united states. it is available as a generic medication and marketed under many brand names worldwide. in 2018, it was the 25th most commonly prescribed medication in the united states, with more than 24 million prescriptions.


== medical uses ==

tramadol (a schedule iv drug in the us) is used primarily to treat mild to severe pain, both acute and chronic. there is moderate evidence for use as a second-line treatment for fibromyalgia but is not fda approved for this use, however, its use is approved for treatment of fibromyalgia as a secondary painkiller by the nhs.its analgesic effects take about one hour to come into effect and 2 to 4 h to peak after oral administration with an immediate-release formulation. on a dose-by-dose basis, tramadol has about one-tenth the potency of morphine (thus 100 mg is commensurate to 10 mg morphine but may vary) and is practically equally potent when compared with pethidine and codeine . for pain moderate in severity, its effectiveness is equivalent to that of codeine at low doses, and hydrocodone at very high doses; for severe pain it is less effective than morphine.these painkilling effects last about 6 h. the potency of analgesia varies considerably as it depends on an individual's genetics. people with specific variants of cyp2d6 enzymes may not produce adequate amounts of the active metabolite (desmetramadol) for effective pain control.sleep medicine physicians sometimes prescribe tramadol (or other opiate medications) for refractory restless legs syndrome (rls); that is, rls that does not respond adequately to treatment with first-line medications such as dopamine agonists (like pramipexole) or alpha-2-delta (α2δ) ligands (gabapentinoids), often due to augmentation.


== contraindications ==
tramadol may not provide adequate pain control for individuals with certain genetic variants of cyp2d6 enzymes as they metabolize tramadol to the inactive molecule. these genetic polymorphisms are not currently routinely tested for in clinical practice.


=== pregnancy and lactation ===
tramadol's use in pregnancy is generally avoided, as it may cause some reversible withdrawal effects in the newborn. a small prospective study in france found, while an increased risk of miscarriages existed, no major malformations were reported in the newborn. its use during lactation is also generally advised against, but a small trial found that infants breastfed by mothers taking tramadol were exposed to about 2.88% of the dose the mothers were taking. no evidence of this dose having a harmful effect on the newborn was seen.


=== labor and delivery ===
its use as an analgesic during labor is not advised due to its long onset of action (1 hour). the ratio of the mean concentration of the drug in the fetus compared to that of the mother when it is given intramuscularly for labor pains has been estimated to be 1:94.


=== children ===
its use in children is generally advised against, although it may be done under the supervision of a specialist. on 21 september 2015, the fda started investigating the safety of tramadol in use in persons under the age of 17. the investigation was initiated because some of these people have experienced slowed or difficult breathing. the fda lists age under 12 years old as a contraindication.


=== elderly ===
the risk of opioid-related adverse effects such as respiratory depression, falls, cognitive impairment and sedation is increased. tramadol may interact with other medications and increase the risk for adverse events.


=== liver and kidney failure ===
the drug should be used with caution in those with liver or kidney failure, due to metabolism in the liver (to the active molecule desmetramadol) and elimination by the kidneys.


== side effects ==

the most common adverse effects of tramadol include nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, indigestion, abdominal pain, vertigo, vomiting, constipation, drowsiness, and headache. other side effects may result from interactions with other medications. tramadol has the same dose-dependent adverse effects as morphine including respiratory depression.


=== dependence and withdrawal ===
long-term use of high doses of tramadol causes physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome. these include both symptoms typical of opioid withdrawal and those associated with serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (snri) withdrawal; symptoms include numbness, tingling, paresthesia, and tinnitus.  psychiatric symptoms may include hallucinations, paranoia, extreme anxiety, panic attacks, and confusion. in most cases, tramadol withdrawal will set in 12–20 hours after the last dose, but this can vary. tramadol withdrawal typically lasts longer than that of other opioids. seven days or more of acute withdrawal symptoms can occur as opposed to typically 3 or 4 days for other codeine analogues.


== overdose ==
recognised risk factors for tramadol overdose include depression, addiction, and seizures. naloxone only partially reverses the toxic effects of tramadol overdose and may increase the risk of seizures.deaths with tramadol overdose have been reported and are increasing in frequency in northern ireland; the majority of these overdoses involves other drugs including alcohol. there were 254 tramadol-related deaths in england and wales in 2013, and 379 in florida in 2011. in 2011, 21,649 emergency room visits in the united states were related to tramadol.


== interactions ==
tramadol can interact with other medications with similar mechanisms of action.
tramadol acts as a serotonin-norephinephrine reuptake inhibitor and thus can interact with other serotonergic medications (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, triptans, cough and cold medications containing dextromethorphan, herbal products containing st. john’s wort, and medications that inhibit the metabolism of serotonin, such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors) and, in combination, may lead to serotonin syndrome. it may also make some  serotonergic antagonist anti-emetic medications (ondansetron) less effective.tramadol also acts as an opioid agonist and thus can increase the risk for side effects when used with other opioid analgesics (such as morphine, pethidine, tapentadol, oxycodone, and fentanyl).tramadol is metabolized by cyp2d6 enzymes which contribute to the metabolism of approximately 25% of all medications. any medications with the ability to inhibit or induce these enzymes may interact with tramadol.tramadol increases the risk for seizures by lowering the seizure threshold. using other medications that lower seizure threshold (such as antipsychotic medications or amphetamines), further increases this risk.


== pharmacology ==


=== mechanism of action ===
tramadol induces analgesic effects through a variety of different targets on the noradrenergic system, serotoninergic system and opioid receptors system. tramadol exists as a racemic mixture, the positive enantiomer inhibits serotonin reuptake while the negative enantiomer inhibits noradrenaline re-uptake, by binding to and blocking the transporters. tramadol has also been shown to act as a serotonin releasing agent. both enantiomers of tramadol are agonists of the μ-opioid receptor and its m1 metabolite, o-demethylate, is also a μ-opioid receptor agonist but is 6 times more potent than tramadol itself. all these effects work synergistically to induce analgesia.

tramadol has been found to possess these actions:
agonist of the μ-opioid receptor (mor) and to a far lesser extent of the δ-opioid receptor (dor) and κ-opioid receptor (kor)
serotonin reuptake inhibitor (sri) and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor; hence, an snri
serotonin 5-ht2c receptor antagonist
m1 and m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist
α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist
nmda receptor antagonist (very weak)
trpa1 inhibitortramadol acts on the opioid receptors through its major active metabolite desmetramadol, which has as much as 700-fold higher affinity for the mor relative to tramadol. moreover, tramadol itself has been found to possess no efficacy in activating the mor in functional activity assays, whereas desmetramadol activates the receptor with high intrinsic activity (emax equal to that of morphine). as such, desmetramadol is exclusively responsible for the opioid effects of tramadol. both tramadol and desmetramadol have pronounced selectivity for the mor over the dor and kor in terms of binding affinity.tramadol is well-established as an sri. in addition, a few studies have found that it also acts as a serotonin releasing agent (1–10 μm), similar in effect to fenfluramine. the serotonin releasing effects of tramadol could be blocked by sufficiently high concentrations of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor 6-nitroquipazine, which is in accordance with other serotonin releasing agents such as fenfluramine and mdma. however, two more recent studies failed to find a releasing effect of tramadol at respective concentrations up to 10 and 30 μm. in addition to serotonergic activity, tramadol is also a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. it is not a norepinephrine releasing agent. tramadol does not inhibit the reuptake or induce the release of dopamine.a positron emission tomography imaging study found that single oral 50-mg and 100-mg doses of tramadol to human volunteers resulted in 34.7% and 50.2% respective mean occupation of the serotonin transporter (sert) in the thalamus. the estimated median effective dose (ed50) for sert occupancy hence was 98.1 mg, which was associated with a plasma tramadol level of about 330 ng/ml (1,300 nm). the estimated maximum daily dosage of tramadol of 400 mg (100 mg q.i.d.) would result in as much as 78.7% occupancy of the sert (in association with a plasma concentration of 1,220 ng/ml or 4,632 nm). this is close to that of ssris, which occupy the sert by 80% or more.peak plasma concentrations during treatment with clinical dosages of tramadol have generally been found to be in the range of 70 to 592 ng/ml (266–2,250 nm) for tramadol and 55 to 143 ng/ml (221–573 nm) for desmetramadol. the highest levels of tramadol were observed with the maximum oral daily dosage of 400 mg per day divided into one 100-mg dose every 6 hours (i.e., four 100-mg doses evenly spaced out per day). some accumulation of tramadol occurs with chronic administration; peak plasma levels with the maximum oral daily dosage (100 mg q.i.d.) are about 16% higher and the area-under-the-curve levels 36% higher than following a single oral 100-mg dose. positron emission tomography imaging studies have reportedly found that tramadol levels are at least four-fold higher in the brain than in plasma. conversely, brain levels of desmetramadol ""only slowly approach those in plasma"". the plasma protein binding of tramadol is only 4 to 20%; hence, almost all tramadol in circulation is free, thus bioactive.


==== correspondence to effects ====
co-administration of quinidine, a potent cyp2d6 enzyme inhibitor, with tramadol, a combination which results in markedly reduced levels of desmetramadol, was found not to significantly affect the analgesic effects of tramadol in human volunteers. however, other studies have found that the analgesic effects of tramadol are significantly decreased or even absent in cyp2d6 poor metabolizers. the analgesic effects of tramadol are only partially reversed by naloxone in human volunteers, hence indicating that its opioid action is unlikely the sole factor; tramadol's analgesic effects are also partially reversed by α2-adrenergic receptor antagonists such as yohimbine, the 5-ht3 receptor antagonist ondansetron, and the 5-ht7 receptor antagonists sb-269970 and sb-258719. pharmacologically, tramadol is similar to tapentadol and methadone in that it not only binds to the mor, but also inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine due to its action on the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems, such as its ""atypical"" opioid activity.tramadol has inhibitory actions on the 5-ht2c receptor. antagonism of 5-ht2c could be partially responsible for tramadol's reducing effect on depressive and obsessive–compulsive symptoms in patients with pain and co-morbid neurological illnesses. 5-ht2c blockade may also account for its lowering of the seizure threshold, as 5-ht2c knockout mice display significantly increased vulnerability to epileptic seizures, sometimes resulting in spontaneous death. however, the reduction of seizure threshold could be attributed to tramadol's putative inhibition of gabaa receptors at high doses (significant inhibition at 100 μm). in addition, desmetramadol is a high-affinity ligand of the dor, and activation of this receptor could be involved in tramadol's ability to provoke seizures in some individuals, as dor agonists are well known for inducing seizures.nausea and vomiting caused by tramadol are thought to be due to activation of the 5-ht3 receptor via increased serotonin levels. in accordance, the 5-ht3 receptor antagonist metoclopramide can be used to treat tramadol-associated nausea and vomiting. tramadol and desmetramadol themselves do not bind to the 5-ht3 receptor.


=== pharmacokinetics ===

tramadol undergoes hepatic metabolism via the cytochrome p450 isozyme cyp2b6, cyp2d6, and cyp3a4, being o- and n-demethylated to five different metabolites. of these, desmetramadol (o-desmethyltramadol) is the most significant, since it has 200 times the μ-affinity of (+)-tramadol, and furthermore has an elimination half-life of 9 hours, compared with 6 hours for tramadol itself. as with codeine, in the 6% of the population who have reduced cyp2d6 activity (hence reducing metabolism), a reduced analgesic effect is seen. those with decreased cyp2d6 activity require a dose increase of 30% to achieve the same degree of pain relief as those with a normal level of cyp2d6 activity.phase ii hepatic metabolism renders the metabolites water-soluble, which are excreted by the kidneys. thus, reduced doses may be used in renal and hepatic impairment.its volume of distribution is around 306 l after oral administration and 203 l after parenteral administration.


== chemistry ==
tramadol is marketed as a racemic mixture of both r- and s-stereoisomers, because the two isomers complement each other's analgesic activities.  the (+)-isomer is predominantly active as an opiate with a higher affinity for the µ-opiate receptor (20 times higher affinity than the (-)-isomer).


=== synthesis and stereoisomerism ===
the chemical synthesis of tramadol is described in the literature. tramadol [2-(dimethylaminomethyl)-1-(3-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexanol] has two stereogenic centers at the cyclohexane ring. thus, 2-(dimethylaminomethyl)-1-(3-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexanol may exist in four different configurational forms:

(1r,2r)-isomer
(1s,2s)-isomer
(1r,2s)-isomer
(1s,2r)-isomerthe synthetic pathway leads to the racemate (1:1 mixture) of (1r,2r)-isomer and the (1s,2s)-isomer as the main products. minor amounts of the racemic mixture of the (1r,2s)-isomer and the (1s,2r)-isomer are formed as well. the isolation of the (1r,2r)-isomer and the (1s,2s)-isomer from the diastereomeric minor racemate [(1r,2s)-isomer and (1s,2r)-isomer] is realized by the recrystallization of the hydrochlorides.
the drug tramadol is a racemate of the hydrochlorides of the (1r,2r)-(+)- and the (1s,2s)-(−)-enantiomers.
the resolution of the racemate [(1r,2r)-(+)-isomer / (1s,2s)-(−)-isomer] was described employing (r)-(−)- or (s)-(+)-mandelic acid. this process does not find industrial application, since tramadol is used as a racemate, despite known different physiological effects of the (1r,2r)- and (1s,2s)-isomers, because the racemate showed higher analgesic activity than either enantiomer in animals and in humans.


=== detection in biological fluids ===
tramadol and desmetramadol may be quantified in blood, plasma or serum to monitor for abuse, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning or assist in the forensic investigation of a sudden death. most commercial opiate immunoassay screening tests do not cross-react significantly with tramadol or its major metabolites, so chromatographic techniques must be used to detect and quantitate these substances. the concentration of desmetramadol in the blood or plasma of a person who has taken tramadol is generally 10–20% those of the parent drug.


== society and culture ==


=== formulations ===
available dosage forms include liquids, syrups, drops, elixirs, effervescent tablets and powders for mixing with water, capsules, tablets including extended-release formulations, suppositories, compounding powder, and injections.


=== patent history ===
the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) approved tramadol in march 1995, and an extended-release (er) formulation in september 2005. er tramadol was protected by us patents nos. 6,254,887 and 7,074,430. the fda listed the patents' expiration as 10 may 2014. however, in august 2009, us district court for the district of delaware ruled the patents invalid, a decision upheld the following year by the court of appeals for the federal circuit. manufacture and distribution of generic equivalents of ultram er in the united states was therefore permitted prior to the expiration of the patents.


=== legal status ===
effective 18 august 2014, tramadol has been placed into schedule iv of the federal controlled substances act in the united states. before that, some us states had already classified tramadol as a schedule iv controlled substance under their respective state laws.tramadol is classified in schedule 4 (prescription only) in australia, rather than as a schedule 8 controlled drug (possession without authority illegal) like most other opioids.effective may 2008, sweden classified tramadol as a controlled substance in the same category as codeine and dextropropoxyphene, but allows a normal prescription to be used.the uk classified tramadol as a class c, schedule 3 controlled drug on 10 june 2014, but exempted it from the safe custody requirement.


=== misuse ===
illicit use of the drug is thought to be a major factor in the success of the boko haram terrorist organization. when used at higher doses, the drug ""can produce similar effects to heroin."" said one former member, ""whenever we took tramadol, nothing mattered to us anymore except what we were sent to do because it made us very high and very bold, it was impossible to go on a mission without taking it."" tramadol is also used as a coping mechanism in the gaza strip.

=== false findings about sources in nature ===
in 2013, researchers reported that tramadol was found in relatively high concentrations (1%+) in the roots of the african pin cushion tree (nauclea latifolia). in 2014, however, it was reported that the presence of tramadol in the tree roots was the result of tramadol having been administered to cattle by farmers in the region: tramadol and its metabolites were present in the animals' excreta, which contaminated the soil around the trees. therefore, tramadol and its mammalian metabolites were found in tree roots in the far north of cameroon, but not in the south where it is not administered to farm animals.a 2014 editorial in lab times online contested the notion that tramadol in tree roots was the result of anthropogenic contamination, stating that samples were taken from trees which grew in national parks, where livestock were forbidden; it also quoted researcher michel de waard, who stated that ""thousands and thousands of tramadol-treated cattle sitting around a single tree and urinating there"" would be required to produce the concentrations discovered.in 2015, radiocarbon analysis confirmed that the tramadol found in n.latifolia roots could not be plant-derived and was of synthetic origin.


== veterinary medicine ==
tramadol may be used to treat post-operative, injury-related, and chronic (e.g., cancer-related) pain in dogs and cats as well as rabbits, coatis, many small mammals including rats and flying squirrels, guinea pigs, ferrets, and raccoons.

"hla class ii histocompatibility antigen, drb1-7 beta chain (human)",protein,"the human leukocyte antigen (hla) system or complex is a group of related proteins that are encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (mhc) gene complex in humans. these cell-surface proteins are responsible for the regulation of the immune system. the hla gene complex resides on a 3 mbp stretch within chromosome 6p21. hla genes are highly polymorphic, which means that they have many different alleles, allowing them to fine-tune the adaptive immune system. the proteins encoded by certain genes are also known as antigens, as a result of their historic discovery as factors in organ transplants. different classes have different functions:
hlas corresponding to mhc class i (a, b, and c), all of which are the hla class1 group, present peptides from inside the cell. for example, if the cell is infected by a virus, the hla system brings fragments of the virus to the surface of the cell so that the cell can be destroyed by the immune system. these peptides are produced from digested proteins that are broken down in the proteasomes. in general, these particular peptides are small polymers, of about 8-10 amino acids in length. foreign antigens presented by mhc class i attract t-lymphocytes called killer t-cells (also referred to as cd8-positive or cytotoxic t-cells) that destroy cells. some new work has proposed that antigens longer than 10 amino acids, 11-14 amino acids, can be presented on mhc i eliciting a cytotoxic t cell response. mhc class i proteins associate with β2-microglobulin, which unlike the hla proteins is encoded by a gene on chromosome 15.
hlas corresponding to mhc class ii (dp, dm, do, dq, and dr) present antigens from outside of the cell to t-lymphocytes. these particular antigens stimulate the multiplication of t-helper cells (also called cd4-positive t cells), which in turn stimulate antibody-producing b-cells to produce antibodies to that specific antigen. self-antigens are suppressed by regulatory t cells.
hlas corresponding to mhc class iii encode components of the complement system.
hlas have other roles. they are important in disease defense. they are the major cause of organ transplant rejections. they may protect against or fail to protect (if down-regulated by an infection) against cancers. mutations in hla may be linked to autoimmune disease (examples: type i diabetes, coeliac disease). hla may also be related to people's perception of the odor of other people, and may be involved in mate selection, as at least one study found a lower-than-expected rate of hla similarity between spouses in an isolated community.aside from the genes encoding the six major antigen-presenting proteins, there are many other genes, many involved in immune function, located on the hla complex. diversity of hlas in the human population is one aspect of disease defense, and, as a result, the chance of two unrelated individuals with identical hla molecules on all loci is extremely low. hla genes have historically been identified as a result of the ability to successfully transplant organs between hla-similar individuals.


== functions ==
the proteins encoded by hlas are those on the outer part of body cells that are (in effect) unique to that person. the immune system uses the hlas to differentiate self cells and non-self cells. any cell displaying that person's hla type belongs to that person and, therefore, is not an invader.


=== in infectious disease ===
when a foreign pathogen enters the body, specific cells called antigen-presenting cells (apcs) engulf the pathogen through a process called phagocytosis. proteins from the pathogen are digested into small pieces (peptides) and loaded onto hla antigens (to be specific, mhc class ii). they are then displayed by the antigen-presenting cells to cd4+ helper t cells, which then produce a variety of effects and cell to cell interactions to eliminate the pathogen.
through a similar process, proteins (both native and foreign, such as the proteins of virus) produced inside most cells are displayed on hlas (to be specific, mhc class i) on the cell surface. infected cells can be recognized and destroyed by cd8+ t cells.the image off to the side shows a piece of a poisonous bacterial protein (sei peptide) bound within the binding cleft portion of the hla-dr1 molecule. in the illustration far below, a different view, one can see an entire dq with a bound peptide in a similar cleft, as viewed from the side. disease-related peptides fit into these ""slots"" much like a hand fits into a glove. when bound, peptides are presented to t cells. t cells require presentation via mhc molecules to recognize foreign antigens — a requirement known as mhc restriction. t cells have receptors that are similar to b cell receptors, and each t cell recognizes only a few mhc class ii-peptide combinations. once a t cell recognizes a peptide within an mhc class ii molecule, it can stimulate b-cells that also recognize the same molecule in their b cell receptors. thus, t cells help b cells make antibodies to the same foreign antigens. each hla can bind many peptides, and each person has 3 hla types and can have 4 isoforms of dp, 4 isoforms of dq and 4 isoforms of dr (2 of drb1, and 2 of drb3, drb4, or drb5) for a total of 12 isoforms. in such heterozygotes, it is difficult for disease-related proteins to escape detection.


=== in graft rejection ===
any cell displaying some other hla type is ""non-self"" and is seen as an invader by the body's immune system, resulting in the rejection of the tissue bearing those cells. this is particularly important in the case of transplanted tissue, because it could lead to transplant rejection. because of the importance of hla in transplantation, the hla loci are some of the most frequently typed by serology and pcr. it has been shown that high resolution hla typing (hla-a, hla-b, hla-c, hla-drb1, hla-dqb1 and hla-dpb1) may be relevant in transplantation to identify a full match, even when the donor is related.


=== in autoimmunity ===
hla types are inherited, and some of them are connected with autoimmune disorders and other diseases. people with certain hla antigens are more likely to develop certain autoimmune diseases, such as type i diabetes, ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease, sle (systemic lupus erythematosus), myasthenia gravis, inclusion body myositis, sjögren syndrome, and narcolepsy. hla typing has led to some improvement and acceleration in the diagnosis of celiac disease and type 1 diabetes; however, for dq2 typing to be useful, it requires either high-resolution b1*typing (resolving *02:01 from *02:02), dqa1*typing, or dr serotyping. current serotyping can resolve, in one step, dq8. hla typing in autoimmunity is being increasingly used as a tool in diagnosis. in celiac disease, it is the only effective means of discriminating between first-degree relatives that are at risk from those that are not at risk, prior to the appearance of sometimes-irreversible symptoms such as allergies and secondary autoimmune disease.


=== in cancer ===
some hla-mediated diseases are directly involved in the promotion of cancer. gluten-sensitive enteropathy is associated with increased prevalence of enteropathy-associated t-cell lymphoma, and dr3-dq2 homozygotes are within the highest risk group, with close to 80% of gluten-sensitive enteropathy-associated t-cell lymphoma cases. more often, however, hla molecules play a protective role, recognizing increases in antigens that are not tolerated because of low levels in the normal state. abnormal cells might be targeted for apoptosis, which is thought to mediate many cancers before diagnosis.


=== in mate selection ===
there is evidence for non-random mate choice with respect to certain genetic characteristics.  this has led to a field known as genetic matchmaking.


== classification ==
mhc class i proteins form a functional receptor on most nucleated cells of the body.there are 3 major and 3 minor mhc class i genes in hla.
major mhc class i

hla-a
hla-b
hla-cminor genes are hla-e, hla-f and hla-g.  β2-microglobulin binds with major and minor gene subunits to produce a heterodimer

there are 3 major and 2 minor mhc class ii proteins encoded by the hla.
the genes of the class ii combine to form heterodimeric (αβ) protein
receptors that are typically expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells.
major mhc class ii proteins only occur on antigen-presenting cells, b cells, and t cells.

4 β-chains (only 3 possible per person), encoded by hla-drb1, drb3, drb4, drb5 locithe other mhc class ii proteins, dm and do, are used in the internal processing of antigens, loading the antigenic peptides generated from pathogens onto the hla molecules of antigen-presenting cell.


=== nomenclature ===
modern hla alleles are typically noted with a variety of levels of detail. most designations begin with hla- and the locus name, then * and some (even) number of digits specifying the allele. the first two digits specify a group of alleles, also known as supertypes. older typing methodologies often could not completely distinguish alleles and so stopped at this level. the third through fourth digits specify a nonsynonymous allele. digits five through six denote any synonymous mutations within the coding frame of the gene. the seventh and eighth digits distinguish mutations outside the coding region. letters such as l, n, q, or s may follow an allele's designation to specify an expression level or other non-genomic data known about it. thus, a completely described allele may be up to 9 digits long, not including the hla-prefix and locus notation.


=== variability ===

mhc loci are some of the most genetically variable coding loci in mammals, and the human hla loci are no exceptions. despite the fact that the human population went through a constriction several times during its history that was capable of fixing many loci, the hla loci appear to have survived such a constriction with a great deal of variation. of the 9 loci mentioned above, most retained a dozen or more allele-groups for each locus, far more preserved variation than the vast majority of human loci. this is consistent with a heterozygous or balancing selection coefficient for these loci. in addition, some hla loci are among the fastest-evolving coding regions in the human genome. one mechanism of diversification has been noted in the study of amazonian tribes of south america that appear to have undergone intense gene conversion between variable
alleles and loci within each hla gene class. less frequently, longer-range productive recombinations through hla genes have been noted producing chimeric genes.
six loci have over 100 alleles that have been detected in the human population. of these, the most variable are hla b and hla drb1. as of 2012, the number of alleles that have been determined are listed in the table below. to interpret this table, it is necessary to consider that an allele is a variant of the nucleotide (dna) sequence at a locus, such that each allele differs from all other alleles in at least one (single nucleotide polymorphism, snp) position. most of these changes result in a change in the amino acid sequences that result in slight to major functional differences in the protein.
there are issues that limit this variation. certain alleles like dqa1*05:01 and dqa1*05:05 encode proteins with identically processed products. other alleles like dqb1*0201 and dqb1*0202 produce proteins that are functionally similar. for class ii (dr, dp and dq), amino acid variants within the receptor's peptide-binding cleft tend to produce molecules with different binding capability.
however, the gene frequencies of the most common alleles (>5%) of hla-a, -b, -c and  hla-dpa1, -dpb1, -dqa1, -dqb1,  and -drb1 from south america have been reported from the typing and sequencing carried out in genetic diversity studies and cases and controls. in addition, information on the allele frequencies of hla-i and hla-ii genes for the european population has been compiled. in both cases the distribution of allele frequencies reveals a regional variation related with the history of the populations.

the large extent of variability in hla genes poses significant challenges in investigating the role of hla genetic variations in diseases. disease association studies typically treat each hla allele as a single complete unit, which does not illuminate the parts of the molecule associated with disease. karp d. r. et al. describes a novel sequence feature variant type (sfvt) approach for hla genetic analysis that categorizes hla proteins into biologically relevant smaller sequence features (sfs), and their variant types (vts). sequence features are combinations of amino acid sites defined based on structural information (e.g., beta-sheet 1), functional information (e.g., peptide antigen-binding), and polymorphism. these sequence features can be overlapping and continuous or discontinuous in the linear sequence. variant types for each sequence feature are defined based upon all known polymorphisms in the hla locus being described. sfvt categorization of hla is applied in genetic association analysis so that the effects and roles of the epitopes shared by several hla alleles can be identified. sequence features and their variant types have been described for all classical hla proteins; the international repository of hla sfvts will be maintained at imgt/hla database.  a tool to convert hla alleles into their component sfvts can be found on the immunology database and analysis portal (immport) website.


==== common, well-documented and rare alleles ====
although the number of individual hla alleles that have been identified is large, approximately 40% of these alleles appear to be unique, having only been identified in single individuals. roughly a third of alleles have been reported more than three times in unrelated individuals. because of this variation in the rate at which of individual hla alleles are detected, attempts have been made to categorize alleles at each expressed hla locus in terms of their prevalence. the result is a catalog of common and well-documented (cwd) hla alleles, and a catalogue of rare and very rare hla alleles.common hla alleles are defined as having been observed with a frequency of at least 0.001 in reference populations of at least 1500 individuals. well-documented hla alleles were originally defined as having been reported at least three times in unrelated individuals, and are now defined as having been detected at least five times in unrelated individuals via the application of a sequence-based typing (sbt) method, or at least three times via a sbt method and in a specific haplotype in unrelated individuals. rare alleles are defined as those that have been reported one to four times, and very rare alleles as those reported only once.


===== table of hla alleles in each prevalence category =====
while the current cwd and rare or very rare designations were developed using different datasets and different versions of the imgt/hla database, the approximate fraction of alleles at each hla locus in each category is shown below.


=== examining hla types ===


==== serotype and allele names ====
there are two parallel systems of nomenclature that are applied to hla. the first, and oldest, system is based on serological (antibody based) recognition. in this system, antigens were eventually assigned letters and numbers (e.g., hla-b27 or, shortened, b27). a parallel system that allowed more refined definition of alleles was developed. in this system, an
""hla"" is used in conjunction with a letter, *, and a four-or-more-digit number (e.g., hla-b*08:01, a*68:01, a*24:02:01n n=null) to designate a specific allele at a given hla locus. hla loci can be further classified into mhc class i and mhc class ii (or rarely, d locus). every two years, a nomenclature is put forth to aid researchers in interpreting
serotypes to alleles.


==== serotyping ====

in order to create a typing reagent, blood from animals or humans would be taken, the blood cells allowed to separate from the serum, and the serum diluted to its optimal sensitivity and used to type cells from other individuals or animals. thus, serotyping became a way of crudely identifying hla receptors and receptor isoforms. over the years, serotyping antibodies became more refined as techniques for increasing sensitivity improved and new serotyping antibodies continue to appear. one of the goals of serotype analysis is to fill gaps in the analysis. it is possible to predict based on 'square root','maximum-likelihood' method, or analysis of familial haplotypes to account for adequately typed alleles. these studies using serotyping techniques frequently revealed, in particular for non-european or north east asian populations many null or blank serotypes. this was particularly problematic for the cw locus until recently, and almost half of the cw serotypes went untyped in the 1991 survey of the human population.
there are several types of serotypes. a broad antigen serotype is a crude measure of identity of cells. for example, hla a9 serotype recognizes cells of a23- and a24-bearing individuals. it may also recognize cells that a23 and a24 miss because of small variations. a23 and a24 are split antigens, but antibodies specific to either are typically used more often than antibodies to broad antigens.


==== cellular typing ====
a representative cellular assay is the mixed lymphocyte culture (mlc) and used to determine the hla class ii types. the cellular assay is more sensitive in detecting hla differences than serotyping. this is because minor differences unrecognized by alloantisera can stimulate t cells. this typing is designated as dw types. serotyped dr1 has cellularly defined as either of dw1 or of dw20 and so on for other serotyped drs. table shows associated cellular specificities for dr alleles. however, cellular typing has inconsistency in the reaction between cellular-type individuals, sometimes resulting differently from predicted. together with difficulty of cellular assay in generating and maintaining cellular typing reagents, cellular assay is being replaced by dna-based typing method.


==== gene sequencing ====
minor reactions to subregions that show similarity to other types can be observed to the gene products of alleles of a serotype group. the sequence of the antigens determines the antibody reactivities, and so having a good sequencing capability (or sequence-based typing) obviates the need for serological reactions. therefore, different serotype reactions may indicate the need to sequence a person's hla to determine a new gene sequence.
broad antigen types are still useful, such as typing very diverse populations with many unidentified hla alleles (africa, arabia, southeastern iran and pakistan, india). africa, southern iran, and arabia show the difficulty in typing areas that were settled earlier. allelic diversity makes it necessary to use broad antigen typing followed by gene sequencing because there is an increased risk of misidentifying by serotyping techniques.
in the end, a workshop, based on sequence, decides which new allele goes into which serogroup either by sequence or by reactivity. once the sequence is verified, it is assigned a number. for example, a new allele of b44 may get a serotype (i.e. b44) and allele id i.e. b*44:65, as it is the 65th b44 allele discovered. marsh et al. (2005) can be considered a code book for hla serotypes and genotypes, and a new book biannually with monthly updates in tissue antigens.


==== phenotyping ====
gene typing is different from gene sequencing and serotyping.
with this strategy, pcr primers specific  to a variant region of dna are used (called ssp-pcr). if a product of the right size is found, the assumption is that the hla allele has been identified. new gene sequences often result in an increasing appearance of ambiguity. because gene typing is based on ssp-pcr, it is possible that new variants, in particular in the class i and drb1 loci, may be missed.
for example, ssp-pcr within the clinical situation is often used for identifying hla phenotypes. an example of an extended phenotype for a person might be:
a*01:01/*03:01, c*07:01/*07:02, b*07:02/*08:01, drb1*03:01/*15:01,
dqa1*05:01/*01:02, dqb1*02:01/*06:02
in general, this is identical to the extended serotype:
a1,a3,b7,b8,dr3,dr15(2), dq2,dq6(1)
for many populations, such as the japanese or european populations, so many patients have been typed that new alleles are relatively rare, and thus ssp-pcr is more than adequate for allele resolution. haplotypes can be obtained by typing family members in areas of the world where ssp-pcr is unable to recognize alleles and typing requires the sequencing of new alleles. areas of the world where ssp-pcr or serotyping may be inadequate include central africa, eastern africa, parts of southern africa, arabia, s. iran, pakistan, and india.


==== haplotypes ====
an hla haplotype is a series of hla ""genes"" (loci-alleles) by chromosome, one passed from the mother and one from the father.
the phenotype exampled above is one of the more common in ireland and is the result of two common genetic haplotypes:
a*01:01 ; c*07:01 ; b*08:01 ; drb1*03:01 ; dqa1*05:01 ; dqb1*02:01
(by serotyping a1-cw7-b8-dr3-dq2)
which is called ' 'super b8' ' or ' 'ancestral haplotype' ' and
a*03:01 ; c*07:02 ; b*07:02 ; drb1*15:01 ; dqa1*01:02 ; dqb1*06:02
(by serotyping a3-cw7-b7-dr15-dq6 or the older version  ""a3-b7-dr2-dq1"")
these haplotypes can be used to trace migrations in the human population
because they are often much like a fingerprint of an event that has occurred
in evolution. the super-b8 haplotype is enriched in the western irish, declines along gradients away from that region, and is found only in areas of the world where western europeans have migrated. the ""a3-b7-dr2-dq1"" is more widely spread, from eastern asia to iberia. the super-b8 haplotype is associated with a number of diet-associated autoimmune diseases. there are 100,000s of extended haplotypes, but only a few show a visible and nodal character in the human population.


== role of allelic variation ==
studies of humans and animals imply a heterozygous selection mechanism operating on these loci as an explanation for this  variability. one proposed mechanism is sexual selection in which females are able to detect males with different hla relative to their own type.  while the dq and dp encoding loci have fewer alleles, combinations of a1:b1 can produce a theoretical potential of 7,755 dq and 5,270 dp αβ heterodimers, respectively. while nowhere near this number of isoforms exist in the human population, each individual can carry 4 variable dq and dp isoforms, increasing the potential number of antigens that these receptors can present to the immune system.
studies of the variable positions of dp, dr, and dq reveal that peptide antigen contact residues on class ii molecules are most frequently the site of variation in the protein primary structure. therefore, through a combination of intense allelic variation and/or subunit pairing, the class ii peptide receptors are capable of binding an almost endless variation of peptides of 9 amino acids or longer in length, protecting interbreeding subpopulations from nascent or epidemic diseases. individuals in a population frequently have different haplotypes, and this results in many combinations, even in small groups. this diversity enhances the survival of such groups, and thwarts evolution of epitopes in pathogens, which would otherwise be able to be shielded from the immune system.


== antibodies ==
hla antibodies are typically not naturally occurring, and with few exceptions are formed as a result of an immunologic challenge to a foreign material containing non-self hlas via blood transfusion, pregnancy (paternally inherited antigens), or organ or tissue transplant.
antibodies against disease-associated hla haplotypes have been proposed as a treatment for severe autoimmune diseases.donor-specific hla antibodies have been found to be associated with graft failure in renal, heart, lung, and liver transplantation.


== hla matching for sick siblings ==

in some diseases requiring hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, preimplantation genetic diagnosis may be used to give rise to a sibling with matching hla, although there are ethical considerations.

knockanure,non_science,"the valley of knockanure is the name of several ballads  commemorating a murder by the royal irish constabulary that occurred during the irish war of independence at gortaglanna (gortagleanna) near knockanure, county kerry, ireland. the best-known of these was written by teacher and poet bryan macmahon (d. 1997) at the request of a local schoolmaster, pádraig ó ceallacháin.


== historical background ==
on 12 may 1921, a troop of black and tans were travelling out from listowel towards athea when they arrested four young unarmed men in gortaglanna. prior to this the barracks in listowel had been burnt out and in retaliation the troops, who were under the influence of alcohol, decided to execute the young men. the first to be shot was jerry lyons. when this happened, cornelius dee decided, as he was going to be shot anyway, to make a run for it. he did, and almost immediately took a bullet in the thigh but managed to keep going. he ran for about three miles and survived. he was never recaptured but remained in hiding until the truce. the other two men were shot on the spot. today a memorial stands by the roadside where the three died. a film about the events was made in 2009.

== production ==
the series was created by natasha lyonne, amy poehler, and leslye headland, all of whom also serve as executive producers. headland wrote the first episode, and she and lyonne also serve as writers for the series. production companies involved with the series consist of universal television, paper kite productions, jax media, and 3 arts entertainment.alongside the initial series order announcement, it was confirmed that lyonne would star in the series. alongside the premiere announcement, it was confirmed that greta lee, yul vazquez, elizabeth ashley, and charlie barnett had joined the main cast and that chloë sevigny, dascha polanco, brendan sexton iii, rebecca henderson, jeremy bobb, ritesh rajan, and jocelyn bioh would make guest appearances. in march 2021, annie murphy was cast for the second season in an undisclosed role and capacity while carolyn michelle smith joined the cast in a recurring role.principal photography for season one began on february 22, 2018, in new york city.on june 11, 2019, netflix renewed the series for a second season. in march 2020, filming for season two was delayed due to the covid-19 pandemic. production began one year later in march 2021.


== music ==
the song ""gotta get up"" by american singer-songwriter harry nilsson was used as the ""reset"" song each time the character nadia dies and is resurrected. lyonne explained to the new york times that in choosing the song she was struck by the ""buoyant doomsday quality"" of nilsson's life. other contenders for the reset song included ""not tonight"" by lil' kim, ""crazy feeling"" by lou reed and ""no fun"" by the stooges. though netflix finally obtained the usage rights to nilsson's song, the cost of using it so many times took up a significant portion of the music budget. his estate also limited how many times the song could be used. according to music supervisor brienne rose, the production was able to ""find a balance between the maximum number of uses and what the budget would allow."" the ""reset"" song utilized for the character alan was beethoven's ""piano concerto no. 4 in g major"".


== release ==
on january 9, 2019, netflix released the first trailer for the series. on january 23, 2019, the series held its official premiere at the metrograph theater in new york city, new york. those in attendance included series writer jocelyn bioh, taylor schilling, natasha lyonne, fred armisen, amy poehler, chloë sevigny, greta lee, dascha polanco, rosie o'donnell, danielle brooks, laura prepon, and david harbour.

abciximab,drug,"abciximab, a glycoprotein iib/iiia receptor antagonist manufactured by janssen biologics bv and distributed by eli lilly under the trade name reopro, is a platelet aggregation inhibitor mainly used during and after coronary artery procedures like angioplasty to prevent platelets from sticking together and causing thrombus (blood clot) formation within the coronary artery. it is a glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibitor.while abciximab has a short plasma half-life, due to its strong affinity for its receptor on the platelets, it may occupy some receptors for weeks. in practice, platelet aggregation gradually returns to normal about 96 to 120 hours after discontinuation of the drug. abciximab is made from the fab fragments of an immunoglobulin that targets the glycoprotein iib/iiia receptor on the platelet membrane.


== indications for use ==
abciximab is indicated for use in individuals undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (angioplasty with or without stent placement). the use of abciximab in this setting is associated with a decreased incidence of ischemic complications due to the procedure and a decreased need for repeated coronary artery revascularization in the first month following the procedure.research also shows that this drug can be of use for patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease. it is not the appropriate drug of choice if a patient is scheduled for an emergency surgery (i.e., heart surgery) because bleeding time may take about 12 hours to normalize. pediatric uses include treatment of kawasaki disease.


== pharmacokinetics ==
abciximab has a plasma half-life of about ten minutes, with a second phase half-life of about 30 minutes. however, its effects on platelet function can be seen for up to 48 hours after the infusion has been terminated, and low levels of glycoprotein iib/iiia receptor blockade are present for up to 15 days after the infusion is terminated. abciximab does not require dose adjustments for patients with kidney failure.


== side-effects ==
many of the side effects of abciximab are due to its anti-platelet effects which increase the risk of bleeding. the most common type of bleeding due to abciximab is gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
thrombocytopenia is a rare but known serious risk characterized by a severe drop in platelets circulating in the blood. abciximab induced thrombocytopenia is usually rapid occurring hours after administration but may occur up to 16 days later. transfusing platelets is the only known treatment for abciximab-induced thrombocytopenia, but this therapy may have limited effectiveness because the drug may bind and inhibit the receptors on the newly transfused platelets.

"nadph:adrenodoxin oxidoreductase, mitochondrial (mouse)",protein,"adrenodoxin reductase (enzyme nomenclature name: adrenodoxin-nadp+ reductase, ec 1.18.1.6), was first isolated from bovine adrenal cortex where it functions as the first enzyme in the mitochondrial p450 systems that catalyze essential steps in steroid hormone biosynthesis.
examination of complete genome sequences revealed that adrenodoxin reductase gene is present in most metazoans and prokaryotes.


== nomenclature ==
the name of the enzyme was coined based on its function to reduce a [2fe-2s] (2 iron, 2 sulfur) electron-transfer protein that was named adrenodoxin. later, in some studies, the enzyme was also referred to as a ""ferredoxin reductase"", as adrenodoxin is a ferredoxin. in the human gene nomenclature, the standard name is ferredoxin reductase and the symbol is fdxr, with adxr specified as a synonym.
the assignment of the name ""ferredoxin reductase"" has been criticized as a misnomer because determination of the structure of adrenodoxin reductase revealed that it is completely different from that of plant ferredoxin reductase and there is no homology between these two enzymes. with more proteins with a ferroxodin-reducing activity discovered in both families as well as novel families, this enzyme activity is now seen as an example of convergent evolution.


== function ==
adrenodoxin reductase is a flavoprotein as it carries a fad type coenzyme. the enzyme functions as the first electron transfer protein of mitochondrial p450 systems such as p450scc. the fad coenzyme receives two electrons from nadph and transfers them one at a time to the electron transfer protein adrenodoxin. adrenodoxin functions as a mobile shuttle that transfers electrons between adxr and mitochondrial p450s.it catalyzes the following reaction:

nadph + 2 oxidized adrenodoxin —→ 2 reduced adrenodoxin + nadp+ + h+


== gene structure ==
the cdna for adrenodoxin reductase was first cloned in 1987. in both bovine and human genomes there is only a single copy of the gene.


== sites of expression ==
adxr gene is expressed in all tissues that have mitochondrial p450s. the highest levels of the enzyme are found in the adrenal cortex, granulosa cells of the ovary and leydig cells of the testis that specialize in steroid hormone synthesis. immmunofluorescent staining shows that enzyme is localized in mitochondria.
the enzyme is also expressed in the liver, the kidney and the placenta.


== enzyme structure ==
adrenodoxin reductase has two domains that bind nadph and fad separately. the fad and nadp binding sites of the enzyme were predicted by sequence analysis of the enzyme. while the fad-binding site has a consensus sequence (gly-x-gly-x-x-gly) that is similar to other rossmann folds in fad and nad binding sites, the nadph binding site consensus sequence differs from the fad-binding site by the substitution of an alanine instead of the last gly (gly-x-gly-x-x-ala). the location of these fad and nadp binding sites were confirmed by the crystal structure of the enzyme.

com-s-s-cob,reagent,"s. g. warburg & co. was a london-based investment bank. it was listed on the london stock exchange and was once a constituent of the ftse 100 index. the firm was acquired by the swiss bank corporation in 1995 and ultimately became a part of ubs.


== history ==


=== founding and early history ===
this bank was founded in 1946 by siegmund warburg and henry grunfeld. siegmund was a member of the warburg family, a prominent german-jewish banking family. henry grunfeld was a former industrialist in the german steel industry, and is also jewish. warburg and grunfeld fled nazi germany in the 1930s.s. g. warburg and co. were recognised for its pioneering mergers and takeover work in the uk in the 1960s. these works included the first ever hostile takeover in the uk and the first-ever eurobond issue, which fostered the new eurodollar market. the firm's acquisition of seligman bros. in 1957 was a significant event in its rise to prominence; through this, warburg gained a place on the accepting houses committee, which is composed of the 17 top merchant banks with access to cheap capital backed by the bank of england.in 1958–1959, tube investments, advised by s. g. warburg & co, fought a fierce and ultimately successful battle to acquire british aluminium in a bidding war with a consortium of city of london bankers led by morgan grenfell. this battle is now remembered as the ""aluminium war"" and started a shift away from relational banking towards competitive banking.


=== the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s ===
the bank gained clients and grew rapidly in the 1960s and 1970s. in the early 1970s, s. g. warburg entered into a u.s. joint venture with paris-based paribas (banque de paris et des pays-bas, prior to the bank's nationalisation in 1982) named mercury securities. in 1974, s. g. warburg and paribas took a 40% interest in a.g. becker & co., a u.s.-based brokerage.  although the joint venture initially provided an international dimension for its three members, the relationships soured in the late 1970s and early 1980s. the joint venture was plagued by competition between warburg and paribas, as well as cultural conflicts between french, english, and american executives. although warburg had originally planned to buy out paribas, after siegmund warburg's death, paribas bought out warburg's interest in the joint venture in early 1983.  following the departure of warburg from the joint venture, the firm was renamed a.g. becker paribas.a major participant in the ""big bang"" reforms of the 1980s under the leadership of its chief executive sir david scholey, it acquired stockjobber ackroyd & smithers, stockbroker rowe & pitman, and the government gilt broker mullens & co. the bank became the preeminent uk-based m&a (merger and acquisition) adviser, equity underwriter, research house and (via its mercury asset management subsidiary) asset manager by the early 1990s. at its peak more than half the companies on the ftse 100 used mercury asset management for investment management purposes.


=== swiss bank corporation acquisition ===
following another flawed and costly expansion into the united states, in 1994 a merger was announced with morgan stanley, but the talks collapsed.the following year s. g. warburg was purchased by swiss bank corporation. swiss bank corporation merged s. g. warburg with its own existing investment banking unit to create sbc warburg, which became a leading player in global investment banking. in 1997, sbc warburg was merged with u.s. investment bank dillon, read & co. to create warburg dillon read.after the merger of swiss bank corporation and union bank of switzerland in 1998, warburg dillon read was renamed, ubs warburg.  the warburg name was finally retired in 2003 when the investment banking operation of ubs was renamed ubs investment bank.

cer(d44:0),reagent,"a ganglioside is a molecule composed of a glycosphingolipid (ceramide and oligosaccharide) with one or more sialic acids (e.g. n-acetylneuraminic acid, nana) linked on the sugar chain. neunac, an acetylated derivative of the carbohydrate sialic acid, makes the head groups of gangliosides anionic at ph 7, which distinguishes them from globosides.
the name ganglioside was first applied by the german scientist ernst klenk in 1942 to lipids newly isolated from ganglion cells of the brain. more than 60 gangliosides are known,  which differ from each other mainly in the position and number of nana residues. it is a component of the cell plasma membrane that modulates cell signal transduction events, and appears to concentrate in lipid rafts.
recently, gangliosides have been found to be highly important molecules in immunology. natural and semisynthetic gangliosides are considered possible therapeutics for neurodegenerative disorders.


== location ==
gangliosides are present and concentrated on cell surfaces, with the two hydrocarbon chains of the ceramide moiety embedded in the plasma membrane and the oligosaccharides located on the extracellular surface, where they present points of recognition for extracellular molecules or surfaces of neighboring cells. they are found predominantly in the nervous system where they constitute 6% of all phospholipids.


== function ==
the oligosaccharide groups on gangliosides extend well beyond the surfaces of the cell membranes, and act as distinguishing surface markers that can serve as specific determinants in cellular recognition and cell-to-cell communication. these carbohydrate head groups also act as specific receptors for certain pituitary glycoprotein hormones and certain bacterial protein toxins such as cholera toxin.
the functions of gangliosides as specific determinants suggest its important role in the growth and differentiation of tissues as well as in carcinogenesis. it has been found that tumor formation can induce the synthesis of a new complement of ganglioside, and very low concentrations of a specific ganglioside can induce differentiation of cultured neuronal tumor cells.

== pathology ==
gangliosides are continuously synthesized and degraded in cells. they are degraded to ceramides by sequential removal of sugar units in the oligosaccharide group, catalyzed by a set of highly specific lysosomal enzymes. mutations in genes coding for these enzymes leads to the accumulation of partially broken down gangliosides in lysosomes, which results in a group of diseases called gangliosidosis. for example, the fatal tay–sachs disease arises as a genetic defect which leads to no functional hexosaminidase a produced, causing gm2 to accumulate in lysosomes. ultimately the ganglion cells in the nervous system swell enormously, disturbing the normal functions of neurons.

gangliosides are also involved in several diseases:

influenza, in which haemagglutinin of influenza virus exploits certain gangliosides to enter and infect the cells expressing them.
guillain–barré syndrome, which has been linked to the production of anti-ganglioside antibodies.
cholera
tetanus
botulism
leprosy
obesity, where inadequate ganglioside expression in mediobasal hypothalamic neurons deregulates neuronal leptin and insulin signaling.

leen valley lines of the great northern railway,non_science,"the leen valley lines of the great northern railway were english railway branch lines built to get access to collieries in the nottinghamshire coalfield. the midland railway had long been dominant in the area, but there was resentment against its monopolistic policies from coalowners, who encouraged the great northern railway to build a line. the leen valley line was opened in 1881; it ran as far as annesley colliery. a passenger service was run the following year, and very considerable volumes of coal were hauled.
coal owners in areas further north made representations to the great northern railway, which agreed to extend the line, and the leen valley extension line opened in 1892. the manchester, sheffield and lincolnshire railway had built a line on a nearby alignment including a long tunnel, and to avoid the cost of duplicating the tunnel, the gnr arranged to use the ms&lr tunnel to connect its extension line to the original section. at its northern extremity, the line connected to the lancashire, derbyshire and east coast railway at shirebrook. a passenger operation was worked on the extension line too, but again coal traffic was massively dominant. in fact the passenger service was discontinued in 1931.
in the 1960s and 1970s coal production in the area declined steeply, and the duplication of railway routes in the area meant that rationalisation was inevitable: it was the former gnr lines that bore the brunt of this. in the 1980s plans were formulated to reopen a passenger train service from nottingham to mansfield; this was to be mainly on the former midland railway route, but a short section of the former gnr line was used around kirkby-in-ashfield. the new service and route, marketed as the robin hood line, was opened progressively from 1995 onwards.


== background ==
the great northern railway had established a terminal in nottingham in 1857, and used the ambergate, nottingham, boston and eastern junction railway to reach it from its main line at grantham. it later leased the ambergate company.there was considerable colliery activity in the coalfields to the north and west of nottingham, and for the time being the midland railway was dominant in serving the pits. the great northern railway sought to share in the business of hauling the coal to southern and eastern markets; at the same time the midland railway went to considerable lengths to exclude the gnr from the access it sought, and in 1871 prevented the gnr from using midland railway lines in the area at all. this exacerbated dissatisfaction on the part of coalowners, who saw that the midland was exploiting its monopoly of carriage of coal to their disadvantage, and they encouraged the provision of competing railway facilities.
the gnr obtained parliamentary authority for what became its derbyshire and staffordshire extension, a new independent railway line from the gnr line at colwick, on the eastern margin of nottingham. the new line was to circle round the north of nottingham and head west, connecting in kimberley and ilkeston on the way to derby and burton on trent, with a fork to link in pinxton. these lines opened between 1875 and 1878.


== demand for colliery connections ==
there was also a concentration of collieries in the valley of the river leen, which runs south from near newstead to join the river trent west of nottingham. railway connection in this area too was dominated by the midland railway. during the final stages of the construction of the derbyshire lines, the gnr was receiving representations from the leen valley collieries. a line was surveyed and a bill submitted for the 1880 session of parliament. the line would be broadly parallel to the midland railway's nottingham to mansfield line.the midland railway saw the danger and suggested in june that if the bill was withdrawn the charges for the use of its line would be substantially reduced. reductions from 1s 7d down to 1s were mentioned. the gnr had suffered heavily in the past under the midland railway's traffic arrangements, and refused. the leen valley's act was passed on 6 august 1880.


== leen valley line: construction and opening ==
construction was put in hand immediately: on 5 november 1880 a contractor named lovatt undertook the work for £89,077 and to complete by 1 january 1882. saxby and farmer were to install the signalling.
the new line was to make a junction with the derbyshire extension line near old basford and run north, paralleling the midland railway's line from nottingham to mansfield. in doing so the new line crossed the midland line twice, and connected with collieries at bestwood, hucknall, linby, newstead, and annesley. the gnr called the branch line the leen valley line, and the junction with the derbyshire & staffordshire extension line was named leen valley junction.
from leen valley junction the line ran for 6 miles 53 chains to newstead, and was double track throughout when completed. there were colliery branches to bestwood park, four to hucknall colliery, two to linby colliery, two to bestwood colliery, and two at the end of the line to annesley colliery. gradients were stiff, with considerable stretches of 1 in 70 and 1 in 75. leen valley junction signalbox was commissioned on 9 may 1881 and in july coal traffic from bestwood colliery began over a single line. on 18 october the line was opened to linby colliery and on 27 october 1881, the line opened throughout for coal. twelve passenger trains each way on weekdays and two on sundays, began between nottingham and newstead on 2 october 1882. the result was an increase for the half-year to 31 december 1881, of over a quarter of a million tons of coal carried over the gnr system.


== ms&lr extension to annesley ==
the ms&lr chairman, sir edward watkin, had for some time been known to want to extend the manchester, sheffield and lincolnshire railway to london. in time for the 1889 session of parliament, the ms&lr presented a bill for a line from beighton, a little east of sheffield, southwards to annesley, to make an end-on junction there with the gnr leen valley line. on the face of it the scheme looked like a harmless approach to get access to the collieries, but the gnr board suspected that this was a move towards a london extension. watkin also controlled the metropolitan railway, which reached as far north as verney in buckinghamshire, and in the same session, had deposited a bill for a line from quainton road to moreton pinkney; the gap between annesley and morton pinkney was only 60 miles.the ms&lr denied any intention to build south from annesley, but declined to make that a formal undertaking. amid much railway politics, it became evident that parliament was going to grant the ms&lr wishes, and the gnr acquiesced, gaining running powers to sheffield over the ms&lr as a sweetener. the ms&lr annesley branch was passed on 26 july 1889.
in fact the ms&lr promise was soon proven to be false, and it had a london extension bill in the 1891 session, but with london and north western railway and midland railway as well as gnr opposition it failed. nevertheless, it was obvious that the ms&lr would try again the following year, and the gnr board reviewed their strategy: should they continue to oppose the scheme, or go along with it and try to get the best accommodation out of it? they reluctantly chose the latter course of action. as part of that, a leen valley extension scheme was revived.the ms&lr extension southwards from beighton reached an end-on junction with the gnr leen valley line at annesley, north of newstead, on 24 october 1892. in accordance with the agreement, ms&lr goods and coal trains ran to nottingham, followed by passenger trains on 2 january 1893: there were four each way via the nottingham suburban railway to london road. from 28 january, there were a few gnr passenger trains over the ms&lr as far as staveley, but only for a few months. the gnr obtained access to several collieries, but unfortunately for the gnr, an ms&lr-lnwr agreement meant that the lnwr did too.meanwhile, the fresh ms&lr extension bill passed most stages by june 1892 but, held up when parliament was dissolved, did not become an act until 28 march 1893.


== leen valley extension line ==
the gnr now decided that it should extend further north from annesley, and this became the project for the leen valley extension line. it was authorised on 20 june 1892, with an amending act on 29 june 1893. at this time the gnr had so many commitments that construction was delayed. stanton ironworks co., which had collieries at silverhill, teversal and pleasley and sutton-in-ashfield, asked the gnr to hurry up.as originally planned, the line would have begun at the end of the original line, at annesley, which would have meant construction of a tunnel under robin hood hills. but as the ms&lr opened its extension to that spot through a tunnel built for their line, it was arranged that gnr trains would use the ms&lr line through their annesley tunnel, and then for 450 yards to south kirkby junction, where the new line would diverge. w binns had the contract, and began work in june 1895, but got into difficulties excavating a deep cutting through rock.work continued with financial support from the gnr, through a further deep cutting, and a bridge under the midland railway, where there was a difficult operation on a saturday night to install the bridge before the first midland train on sunday morning; the line continued by the erewash headwaters to sutton-in-ashfield, a distance of four miles. some land came from lord carnarvon, then the line went through another limestone cutting into the meden valley, through skegby to pleasley colliery. from skegby, there was a 2-mile branch to teversal and silver hill collieries. on 8 february 1897 the single line was opened for coal traffic to skegby, teversal and silverhill.meanwhile, the board decided to operate a passenger service when the line opened, and in april gave a contract to pattinsons for stations at sutton, skegby and teversal for £14,742. owing to binns' difficulties, his contract was transferred on 7 may to the halifax commercial banking co. the skegby to pleasley section opened for coal and general goods on 1 march 1898. a passenger service of seven trains each way between nottingham london road and skegby, and two each way as far as sutton, all via the nottingham suburban line, were run on weekdays and two suttons each way via gedling on sundays; these services began on 4 april. sutton station, with street-level booking office and covered stairways down to the platforms, was on an elaborate scale, the most centrally situated in the town. skegby, a mile further on, was smaller, on the high level with booking office below. teversal received a small passenger station too, but never had a regular service, only miners' trains and occasional excursions.the opening was celebrated by special trains from king's cross, and nottingham, bringing guests to a lunch at skegby, at which mr capel presided.


== lancashire, derbyshire and east coast railway ==

the lancashire, derbyshire and east coast railway was an ambitious scheme, with the primary intention of conveying coal. it was unable to secure the investment needed to make its network, and only a greatly reduced part was made. it opened its main section, a west to east line, on 8 march 1897. it ran through shirebrook, and the leen valley extension line made a connection to it, opening in 1898. the junction was named langwith junction, facing towards chesterfield. the gnr langwith station later became known as shirebrook south, where passenger services began on 1 november 1901. a connection was made from just south of the station to shirebrook colliery, opened on 26 november 1900.


== completion of the extension line ==
the original powers for the leen valley extension line included a branch to the colliery at langwith, north of the ld&ecr, but in october 1895 the gnr arranged to join the ld&ecr east of langwith station instead, forming a slightly shorter route, and giving a direct run towards both chesterfield and the beighton line; there was a branch to the colliery off that line, with running powers there over the section of the ld&ecr; that company obtained reciprocal running powers to shirebrook colliery. an act of 29 july 1896 authorised the deviation, and the shirebrook colliery branch. a north to west curve was laid to the gcr (former ms&lr) at kirkby in 1897, but was rarely used and was removed after a few years.from pleasley, the line continued above meden valley, leaving it at pleasley vale where a rock cutting was required to shirebrook station, and then a high embankment above the town to langwith junction. the line reached shirebrook colliery (on the branch south of the station), on 26 november 1900, and on 29 may 1901, langwith junction for coal and general goods. passenger trains to pleasley and shirebrook began on 1 november, ten each way, extras on saturdays. the shirebrook to langwith section had heavy coal traffic, and caused more use of powers over the ld&ecr. a south to west curve at langwith was discussed, but the work was limited to the laying of further sidings. the shirebrook passenger trains were extended to langwith, and over the ld&ecr to chesterfield from 1 february 1903, but soon withdrawn, and not restored until lner days.


== ms&lr london extension ==
contrary to the promise that no southward extension from annesley was intended by the ms&lr, the company proceeded with the project. it ran down the leen valley, providing a third railway in the confines of the valley. the london extension line came south from annesley (no longer an end-on junction) through bulwell, over the gnr derbyshire extension line to new basford, through sherwood rise tunnel to nottingham. connections at the intersection were complicated. the ms&lr (soon to be gcr) line ran broadly north to south and the gnr derbyshire line ran east to west. the leen valley line running southward made a connection from moorthorpe junction (or bestwood junction) into the gcr southbound at bulwell north junction, grade separated on the gcr line. this was known as the bestwood branch and was joint gcr and gnr, and it opened in 1898. also joint and also opened in 1898 was a west to north spur, the basford branch, from basford west junction to bulwell south junction. these connections were authorised by an ms&l act on 6 july 1895.
a south-to-west spur (the ""bagthorpe branch"") was provided by the gnr, bagthorpe junction to basford east junction, grade separated over the gnr line, opened in 1900. another connection was authorised by an ms&lr act on 6 july 1895, from moorbridge junction between bestwood and bulwell forest on the leen valley line, to bulwell common on the ms&lr london extension. the act also authorised a north-to-west spur, to basford and bulwell.the manchester, sheffield and lincolnshire railway changed its title to the great central railway on 1 august 1897.


== mansfield railway ==

as late as 1909 some coalowners in the mansfield area approached the gnr, requesting a gnr branch connection, but they were refused. as a result, they formed their own company, the mansfield railway. they got great central railway support, and deposited a bill for 1910. the gnr and the midland railway opposed. the line was to be from kirkby south, on the gcr extension, just beyond where the gn leen valley extension diverged, cross the gnr curve to kirkby north, and the leen valley extension near sutton-in-ashfield, and go via mansfield, serving several collieries, to the ld&ecr at clipstone. the gcr would work it.
the gnr suggested use of the leen valley extension instead of the southern part, but the promoters said they didn't want another concern between them and the gcr. the bill was passed in july, giving the gcr a useful line the gnr might have had; moreover the gnr did not get running powers.


== shirebrook colliery ==
shirebrook colliery became hugely productive. by 1909 the company was exporting coal to france, russia, italy, spain, germany, norway, and sweden. the colliery produced its first million tons of coal in 1970 and over 1.7 million tons by 1986-87, a north derbyshire area record. the colliery merged with pleasley colliery in 1983, before closing in april 1993.


== early retrenchment ==
as the colliery activity in the area served by the line declined so did the use of the line itself. the west to north spur from kirkby north junction on the great central saw little use, despite its high construction costs. it was virtually moribund by 1905, completely disused by 1918 and dismantled about 1922. passenger traffic had always been a financial liability and the lner withdrew services between shirebrook south and nottingham victoria on 14 september 1931. several goods yards on the line closed in the 1950s.meanwhile, passenger trains serving sutton in ashfield central (on the former mansfield railway) had ceased so british railways reintroduced services from the former great northern station at sutton in ashfield town to nottingham victoria, on 20 february 1956. the experiment was accompanied by the warning, ""use it or lose it""; the warning was apparently not heeded and the service was discontinued from 17 september 1956. the leen valley extension, in conjunction with the former ld&ec branch from beighton to langwith junction, remained an important diversionary route when the main line was closed for engineering work. excursions to the seaside london and other destinations continued to run from the otherwise-closed stations until the mid-1960s.
as colliery activity declined steeply—bestwood during 1967 and kirkby summit in july 1968—the leen valley extension and former great central line between langwith junction and kirkby south junction closed completely on 27 may 1968.annesley tunnel and its approach cuttings were gradually filled with spoil and refuse. the midland formation then suffered the same fate, following closure of the section of track from kirkby in ashfield to annesley on 11 october 1970. in order to eliminate the level crossing at kirkby in ashfield and release land for building, a diversion was brought into operation on 4 april 1972. this involved constructing a short spur between the pye bridge line and the former great northern route south of kirkby, reinstating a short length of the leen valley extension through the town, and laying another spur from the site of summit colliery to the mansfield line at kirkby hardwick. south of langwith, an east-north spur between the ld&ecr and midland railway routes opened on 11 november 1974, enabling the remaining part of the beighton branch from shirebrook north to whaley thorns to be closed. goods facilities at mansfield were withdrawn on 2 june 1975, and the remaining railways in the district were now entirely dependent on coal traffic for their survival.langwith colliery closed in february 1979 and teversal in july 1980. these were followed by silverhill april 1985, whitwell june 1986, hucknall october 1986, newstead march 1987, mansfield crown farm march 1988, linby july 1988. annesley was merged with bentinck in march 1988. babbington, annesley, sherwood and warsop collieries, all with links to the line, have closed since 1981. newstead colliery closed in 1987.

there was a long-standing grievance that mansfield was one of the few large towns which was not connected directly to the national rail network. discussions began in 1982, and in 1988 agreement was reached that a line could be reopened for passengers provided local authorities along the route were willing to provide subsidies.
the resulting railway has been named the ""robin hood line"". it was reopened in stages from nottingham northwards. the majority of the route follows the former midland railway leen valley line as far as sutton-in-ashfield, but north from there it uses the great northern route through kirkby before reverting to the midland formation. as part of reinstating the route it was necessary to excavate the midland tunnel at annesley, which had been filled in after closure. the first section from nottingham to newstead opened in 1993, extending to mansfield woodhouse in 1995, kirkby in 1996 and finally through to worksop on the former ms&lr line from lincoln to sheffield in 1998.between kirkby tunnel and sutton parkway station, the train uses trackbeds or track alignments from the midland railway dating from 1848; railtrack dating from 1995; the manchester, sheffield and lincolnshire railway dating from 1892, though now raised by 30 feet; the great northern railway dating from 1896, though now partly above it; british rail from 1972; and the mansfield and pinxton railway (originally horsedrawn) dating from 1819.

cetylpyridinium oral lozenge,drug,"cetylpyridinium chloride (cpc) is a cationic quaternary ammonium compound used in some types of mouthwashes, toothpastes, lozenges, throat sprays, breath sprays, and nasal sprays. it is an antiseptic that kills bacteria and other microorganisms. it has been shown to be effective in preventing dental plaque and reducing gingivitis. it has also been used as an ingredient in certain pesticides. 
though one study seems to indicate cetylpyridinium chloride does not cause brown tooth stains, at least one mouthwash containing cpc as an active ingredient bears the warning label ""in some cases, antimicrobial rinses may cause surface staining to teeth,"" following a class-action lawsuit brought by customers whose teeth were stained.the name breaks down as:

cetyl- means cetyl group, which derives from cetyl alcohol that was first isolated from the whale oil (latin: cetus);
pyridinium refers to the cation [c5h5nh]+, the conjugate acid of pyridine;
chloride refers to the anion cl−.


== medical use ==
otc (over the counter) products containing cetylpyridinium chloride include oral wash, oral rinse, as well as ingestable products (e.g. cpc lozenges). in addition, cough syrups containing cpc are also available as otc medications.
the fda monograph on oral antiseptic drug products reviewed the data regarding cpc and concluded the following:the agency believes that the information contained in its adverse reaction files, 30 years of safe marketing of an otc mouthwash containing cetylpyridinium chloride (nda 14- 598), and the safety data evaluated by the oral cavity panel are sufficient to conclude that 0.025 to 0.1 percent cetylpyridinium chloride is safe as an otc oral antiseptic when labeled for short-term use (not to exceed 7 days).
in addition, the national library of medicine toxicology data network (toxnet) reviewed the range of toxicity of cpc, and stated that, ""significant toxicity is rare after exposure to low concentration products that are typically available in the home.""the fatal dose in humans ingesting cationic detergents has been estimated to be 1 to 3 g. therefore, a person using a typical oral ingestible product that provides 0.25 mg cpc per dose would need to take 4000 doses at one time before they would be in the estimated fatal dose range.
a review found that mouthwashes containing cpc ""provide a small but significant additional benefit when compared with toothbrushing only or toothbrushing followed by a placebo rinse"" in reducing plaque and gingivitis-inflammation. in combination with chlorhexidine and zinc lactate, cpc has been found to be effective in treating halitosis.


== side effects ==


=== tooth staining ===
cetylpyridinium chloride is known to cause tooth staining in approximately 3 percent of users. the crest brand has noted that this staining is actually an indication that the product is working as intended, as the stains are a result of bacteria dying on the teeth. crest stated that because of the low incidence of staining, there was no need to label pro-health mouthwash as a potential tooth stainer. however, after numerous complaints and a federal class-action lawsuit, which was later dismissed, the mouthwash now contains a label warning consumers of its potential to stain teeth.


== toxicology and pharmacology ==
the ld50 of cetylpyridinium chloride has been measured at 30 mg/kg in rats and 36 mg/kg in rabbits when the chemical is administered by intravenous infusion but 200 mg/kg in rats, 400 mg/kg in rabbits, and 108 mg/kg in mice when administered orally.


== chemistry ==
the molecular formula of cetylpyridinium chloride is c21h38ncl. in its pure form it is a solid at room temperature. it has a melting point of 77 °c when anhydrous or 80–83 °c as a monohydrate . it is soluble in water but insoluble in acetone, acetic acid, or ethanol. it has a pyridine-like odor. it is combustible. concentrated solutions are destructive to mucous membranes. its critical micelle concentration (cmc) is ~ 0.0009-0.0011m, and is strongly dependent on the salt concentration of the solution.
some products are formulated instead with the bromide salt cetylpyridinium bromide, the properties of which are virtually identical.

"ergosta-5,7,24(28)-trien-3beta-ol",reagent,"in enzymology, a sterol 14-demethylase (ec 1.14.13.70) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

obtusifoliol + 3 o2 + 3 nadph + 3 h+ 
  
    
      
        ⇌
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rightleftharpoons }
   4alpha-methyl-5alpha-ergosta-8,14,24(28)-trien-3beta-ol + formate + 3 nadp+ + 4 h2othe 4 substrates of this enzyme are obtusifoliol, o2, nadph, and h+, whereas its 4 products are 4alpha-methyl-5alpha-ergosta-8,14,24(28)-trien-3beta-ol, formate, nadp+, and h2o.

although lanosterol 14α-demethylase is present in a wide variety of organisms, this enzyme is studied primarily in the context of fungi, where it plays an essential role in mediating membrane permeability. in fungi, cyp51 catalyzes the demethylation of lanosterol to create an important precursor that is eventually converted into ergosterol. this steroid then makes its way throughout the cell, where it alters the permeability and rigidity of plasma membranes much as cholesterol does in animals. because ergosterol constitutes a fundamental component of fungal membranes, many antifungal medications have been developed to inhibit 14α-demethylase activity and prevent the production of this key compound.


== nomenclature ==
this enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with o2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. the oxygen incorporated need not be derived from o2 with nadh or nadph as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into the other donor.  the systematic name of this enzyme class is sterol,nadph:oxygen oxidoreductase (14-methyl cleaving). other names in common use include obtusufoliol 14-demethylase, lanosterol 14-demethylase, lanosterol 14alpha-demethylase, and sterol 14alpha-demethylase.  this enzyme participates in biosynthesis of steroids.these are not the typical cyp subfamilies, but only one subfamily is created for each major taxonomic group. cyp51a for animals, cyp51b for bacteria. cyp51c for chromista, cyp51d for dictyostelium, cyp51e for euglenozoa, cyp51f for fungi. those groups with only one cyp51 per species are all called by one name: cyp51a1 is for all animal cyp51s since they are orthologous. the same is true for cyp51b, c, d, e and f. cyp51g (green plants) and cyp51hs (monocots only so far) have individual sequence numbers.


== function ==
the biological role of this protein is also well understood. the demethylated products of the cyp51 reaction are vital intermediates in pathways leading to the formation of cholesterol in humans, ergosterol in fungi, and other types of sterols in plants. these sterols localize to the plasma membrane of cells, where they play an important structural role in the regulation of membrane fluidity and permeability and also influence the activity of enzymes, ion channels, and other cell components that are embedded within. with the proliferation of immuno-suppressive diseases such as hiv/aids and cancer, patients have become increasingly vulnerable to opportunistic fungal infections (richardson et al.). seeking new means to treat such infections, drug researchers have begun targeting the 14α-demethylase enzyme in fungi; destroying the fungal cell's ability to produce ergosterol causes a disruption of the plasma membrane, thereby resulting in cellular leakage and ultimately the death of the pathogen (drugbank).
azoles are currently the most popular class of antifungals used in both agricultural and medical settings. these compounds bind as the sixth ligand to the heme group in cyp51, thereby altering the structure of the active site and acting as noncompetitive inhibitors. the effectiveness of imidazoles and triazoles (common azole subclasses) as inhibitors of 14α-demethylase have been confirmed through several experiments. some studies test for changes in the production of important downstream ergosterol intermediates in the presence of these compounds. other studies employ spectrophotometry to quantify azole-cyp51 interactions. coordination of azoles to the prosthetic heme group in the enzyme's active site causes a characteristic shift in cyp51 absorbance, creating what is commonly referred to as a type ii difference spectrum.prolonged use of azoles as antifungals has resulted in the emergence of drug resistance among certain fungal strains. mutations in the coding region of cyp51 genes, overexpression of cyp51, and overexpression of membrane efflux transporters can all lead to resistance to these antifungals. consequently, the focus of azole research is beginning to shift towards identifying new ways to circumvent this major obstacle.


== structure ==
as of late 2007, 6 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with pdb accession codes 1h5z, 1u13, 1x8v, 2bz9, 2ci0, and 2cib.

cns interneuron,cell,"interneurons (also called internuncial neurons, relay neurons, association neurons, connector neurons, intermediate neurons or local circuit neurons) are neurons that connect two brain regions, i.e. not direct motor neurons or sensory neurons. interneurons are the central nodes of neural circuits, enabling communication between sensory or motor neurons and the central nervous system (cns). they play vital roles in reflexes, neuronal oscillations, and neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain.
interneurons can be further broken down into two groups: local interneurons and relay interneurons. local interneurons have short axons and form circuits with nearby neurons to analyze small pieces of information. relay interneurons have long axons and connect circuits of neurons in one region of the brain with those in other regions. the interaction between interneurons allow the brain to perform complex functions such as learning, and decision-making.


== structure ==
in the neocortex (making up about 80% of the human brain), approximately 20–30% of neurons are interneurons.  investigations into the molecular diversity of neurons is impeded by the inability to isolate cell populations born at different times for gene expression analysis. an effective means of identifying coetaneous interneurons is neuronal birthdating. this can be achieved using nucleoside analogs such as edu.in 2008, a nomenclature for the features of gabaergic cortical interneurons was proposed, called petilla terminology.

north carolina anvil,non_science,"the north carolina anvil (or simply the anvil) was an alternative weekly newspaper, subtitled ""a weekly newspaper of politics and the arts,"" published out of durham, north carolina from april 15, 1967 to august 11, 1983.


== origins ==
the anvil was begun by publisher robert v. ""bob"" brown (june 10, 1933 – february 5, 2006), who had previously published a mimeographed civil rights newsletter, chapel hill conscience, during 1963–1964, and the literary magazine reflections from chapel hill, and award-winning poet and fiction writer leon rooke, who had been employed in the news bureau of the university of north carolina at chapel hill and had been the fiction editor for reflections.  in 1969, rooke left the anvil, moving to canada so that his wife could take a teaching position at the university of victoria.  brown remained at the editorial helm for the remainder of the anvil's run, retiring in 1983.


== focus ==
similar to other alt-weeklies or underground newspapers of the era, like the berkeley barb and the village voice, the north carolina anvil focused on arts and entertainment as well as reporting of local political, social, and economic issues for the area in and around the triangle of north carolina. although its politics were comparatively moderate and it was unlike other underground papers in both style and content, the anvil was a member of both the underground press syndicate and the liberation news service. its circulation in the mid-1970s was reported at 8000 copies.

yakov doletsky,non_science,"yakov genrikhovich doletsky (in polish: dolecki; real name fenigstein ) (in russian: долецкий, яков генрихович; real name фенигштейн) (1888 – 19 june 1937) was a polish revolutionary and long-serving head of the soviet news agency tass.


== career ==
doletsky was born in warsaw in 1888. in 1904, at the age of sixteen, doletsky joined the social democracy of the kingdom of poland and lithuania (sdkpil), a party led by rosa luxemburg and jan tyszka. he was soon arrested and imprisoned. after his release, he worked for the sdkpil abroad, then returned to poland to operate illegally in warsaw and lodz. in 1912, he supported the 'rozlamovist' group within the party who opposed tyszka's leadership style and who were allied with vladimir lenin and the bolsheviks. he represented the group at the abortive 'unification' conference in brussels in july 1914, which was supposed to reunite the separate factions of the russian social democratic labour party and the sdpkil. again arrested on his return to poland, he spent two years in prison. on his release in 1916, he joined the bolsheviks.
from march to november 1919, doletsky was deputy chairman of the council of people's commissars and people's commissar of internal affairs in the short-lived soviet republic of lithuania and belarus.
in 1922, he was appointed executive secretary of the rosta news agency.
from 1925 to 1937, he was the executive head of tass, the main soviet news agency and one of the largest news agencies in the world, from its inception in 1925 until 1937.every well-known former member of the sdpkil was arrested during the great purge of 1936–38. doletsky's died on 19 june 1937. according to some sources, he was shot, but according to his family, he committed suicide knowing that his arrest was imminent.


== personality ==
eugene lyons, who worked for tass in the us and regularly corresponded with doletsky, was disillusioned on meeting in moscow in 1928:

at the far end of a long room stood a vast and shiny desk covered with many telephones and push buttons, and behind its imposing expanse sat a bearded, obese little man, blinking behind thick glasses. i was fated to become excessively familiar with the species of ex-revolutionary known as a bureaucrat – people who once risked their lives for a cause but now trembled at the thought of risking their job by a bold word or gesture.""
alexander barmine saw doletsky, whom he described as a ""conscientious official and the kind of man who never got involved in political quarrels"", and deputy people's commissar for foreign affairs, nikolai krestinsky, on two occasions early in 1937: ""on the first occasion they were still both normal men, preoccupied naturally, but capable of smiling, joking, making plans, giving advice. three weeks later they were gloomy and nervous, so absorbed in their inward thoughts that they spoke in dismal tones, stared inattentively, and hardly understood what i said to them. they knew themselves to be doomed men.""


== family ==
doletsky's wife, sofia stanevich, (1897–1961) was an engineer who survived 17 years in the gulag.
their son, stanislav (1919–1994) worked as a surgeon from 1941 and rose to chief children's surgeon for the rsfsr ministry of health. his first wife, kira daniel-bek pirumyan, was the granddaughter of prince daniel bek-pirumyan, hero of the battle of sardarabad.their daughter, alena (aliona) doletskaya, was editor in chief of vogue russia between 1998 and 2010. she played sofia and her nephew artem played stanislav in a film about the family history made in 2010 as part of an anti-stalin project.

pikromycin,antibiotic,"pikromycin was studied by brokmann and hekel in 1951 and was the first antibiotic macrolide to be isolated.
pikromycin is synthesized through a type i polyketide synthase system in streptomyces venezuelae, a species of gram-positive bacterium in the genus streptomyces.
pikromycin is derived from narbonolide, a 14-membered ring macrolide.

along with the narbonolide backbone, pikromycin includes a desosamine sugar and a hydroxyl group.  although pikromycin is not a clinically useful antibiotic, it can be used as a raw material to synthesize antibiotic ketolide compounds such as ertythromycins and new epothilones.


== biosynthesis ==
the pikromycin polyketide synthase of streptomyces venezuelae contains four polypeptides: pikai, pikaii, pikaiii, and pikaiv. these polypeptides contain a loading module, six extension molecules, and a thioesterase domain that terminated the biosynthetic procedure.

recently electron cryo-microscopy have been used to determine sub-nanometre-resolution three- dimensional reconstructions of a full-length pks module from the bacterium streptomyces venezuelae that revealed an unexpectedly different architecture.

in figure 1, each circle corresponds to a pks mutilifuctional protein, where acp is acyl carrier protein, ks is keto-acp synthase, ksq is a keto-acp synthase like domain, at is acyltransferase, kr is keto acp reductase, kr with cross is inactive kr, dh is hydroxyl-thioester dehydratase, er is enoyl reductase, tei is thioesterase domain i, teii is type ii thioesterase. 

des corresponds to the enzymes utilized in desosamine biosynthesis and transfer, which include desi-desviii.
figure 2 represents the desosamine deoxyamino sugar biosynthetic pathway. desi-desvi (des locus of pikromycin pks) encodes all the enzymes needed to obtain tdp-desoamine from tdp-glucose. desvii and desviii activities transfer desoamine to narbonolide and narbomycin is obtained. pikc cytochrome p450 hydrolase catalyzes the hydroxylation of narbomycin to obtain pikromycin.

jacques dextraze,non_science,"jacques alfred dextraze cc, cmm, cbe, dso & bar, kstj, cd (august 15, 1919 – may 9, 1993) was a canadian military officer who served as chief of the defence staff of canada from 1972–1977.


== early life ==
born in montreal, quebec, the son of alfred dextraze and amanda (bond) dextraze, he joined les fusiliers mont-royal in 1940 as a private, and was soon commissioned as lieutenant.


== military career ==
he served in world war ii in north west europe where he was granted command of his regiment in action and was awarded two distinguished service orders. in 1950 he was called back from a civilian career to build, train and command the 2nd battalion, royal 22e régiment, leading it in the korean war. his battalion won considerable acclaim for its stubborn stand at ""hill 355"" when allied troops withdrew, leaving the ""vingt deux"" surrounded but unshaken.
in 1962 he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general.
in 1963 he was the first canadian to be chief of staff of the united nations forces in the republic of the congo (léopoldville).
the military component headquarters, coordinated by dextraze, was in the process of planning the mission's withdrawal in early 1964 as the simba rebellion loomed. dextraze launched a small-scale operation during pierre mulele's kwilu province uprising of january 1964 in order to save at least some of the threatened aid workers and missionaries under attack from the jeunesse.
he also led missions to rescue a group of non governmental organization personnel, who were hostages of katangan rebels in the congo. he was awarded the commander of the order of the british empire for his service. he was one of canada's most distinguished peacekeeping commanders.
in 1967 he was promoted to major general and lieutenant-general in 1968. in 1972, he was promoted to the rank of general and became chief of defence staff of the canadian forces for an unusual period of five years.


== civilian career ==
he retired from the canadian forces in 1977 and from 1977 to 1982 was chairman of the canadian national railway.


== honours ==
in 1978 he was made a companion of the order of canada.
dextraze pavilion, a dining hall at the royal military college saint-jean was named in his honour.


== family ==
in 1942, he married frances helena pare. they had four sons; richard, jacques, robert and john.
his son, richard paul dextraze, was killed in action (kia) in vietnam on april 23, 1969, where he fought as a lance corporal in the united states marine corps, and was a posthumous recipient of the silver star medal and the purple heart. he is interred along with his father in notre dame des neiges cemetery in montreal, quebec.

cbp/p300-interacting transactivator 1 (mouse),protein,"histone acetyltransferase p300 also known as p300 hat or e1a-associated protein p300 (where e1a = adenovirus early region 1a) also known as ep300 or p300 is an enzyme that, in humans, is encoded by the ep300 gene. it functions as histone acetyltransferase that regulates transcription of genes via chromatin remodeling by allowing histone proteins to wrap dna less tightly. this enzyme  plays an essential role in regulating cell growth and division, prompting cells to mature and assume specialized functions (differentiate), and preventing the growth of cancerous tumors. the p300 protein appears to be critical for normal development before and after birth.
the ep300 gene is located on the long (q) arm of the human chromosome 22 at position 13.2. this gene encodes the adenovirus e1a-associated cellular p300 transcriptional co-activator protein.
ep300 is closely related to another gene, creb binding protein, which is found on human chromosome 16.


== function ==
p300 hat functions as histone acetyltransferase that regulates transcription via chromatin remodeling, and is important in the processes of cell proliferation and differentiation. it mediates camp-gene regulation by binding specifically to phosphorylated creb protein.
p300 hat contains a bromodomain which is involved in il6 signaling.this gene has also been identified as a co-activator of hif1a (hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha), and, thus, plays a role in the stimulation of hypoxia-induced genes such as vegf.


== mechanism ==
the p300 protein carries out its function of activating transcription by binding to transcription factors, and the transcription machinery. on the basis of this function, p300 is called a transcriptional coactivator. the p300 interaction with transcription factors is managed by one or more of p300 domains: the nuclear receptor interaction domain (rid), the kix domain (creb and myb interaction domain), the cysteine/histidine regions (taz1/ch1 and taz2/ch3) and the interferon response binding domain (ibid). the last four domains, kix, taz1, taz2 and ibid of p300, each bind tightly to a sequence spanning both transactivation domains 9aatads of transcription factor p53.


== clinical significance ==
mutations in the ep300 gene are responsible for a small percentage of cases of rubinstein-taybi syndrome. these mutations result in the loss of one copy of the gene in each cell, which reduces the amount of p300 protein by half. some mutations lead to the production of a very short, nonfunctional version of the p300 protein, while others prevent one copy of the gene from making any protein at all. although researchers do not know how a reduction in the amount of p300 protein leads to the specific features of rubinstein-taybi syndrome, it is clear that the loss of one copy of the ep300 gene disrupts normal development.
chromosomal rearrangements involving chromosome 22 have rarely been associated with certain types of cancer. these rearrangements, called translocations, disrupt the region of chromosome 22 that contains the ep300 gene. for example, researchers have found a translocation between chromosomes 8 and 22 in several people with a cancer of blood cells called acute myeloid leukemia (aml). another translocation, involving chromosomes 11 and 22, has been found in a small number of people who have undergone cancer treatment. this chromosomal change is associated with the development of aml following chemotherapy for other forms of cancer.
mutations in the ep300 gene have been identified in several other types of cancer. these mutations are somatic, which means they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells. somatic mutations in the ep300 gene have been found in a small number of solid tumors, including cancers of the colon and rectum, stomach, breast, and pancreas. studies suggest that ep300 mutations may also play a role in the development of some prostate cancers, and could help predict whether these tumors will increase in size or spread to other parts of the body. in cancer cells, ep300 mutations prevent the gene from producing any functional protein. without p300, cells cannot effectively restrain growth and division, which can allow cancerous tumors to form.

uss kansas (bb-21),non_science,"uss kansas (bb-21) was a us connecticut-class pre-dreadnought battleship, the fourth of six ships in the class. she was the second ship of the united states navy named in honor of kansas. the ship was launched in august 1905 and commissioned into the fleet in april 1907. kansas was armed with a main battery of four 12-inch (305 mm) guns and was capable of a top speed of 18 kn (33 km/h; 21 mph).
shortly after she entered service, kansas joined the great white fleet for its circumnavigation of the globe in 1908–1909. she made trips to europe in 1910 and 1911 and after 1912, became involved in suppressing unrest in several central american countries, including the united states occupation of veracruz during the mexican revolution. after the united states entered world war i in april 1917, kansas was employed as a training ship for new personnel. in september 1918, she began escorting convoys to europe. after the war ended in november, she then began a series of trips to france to bring american soldiers home.
the ship's postwar career was short. she conducted training cruises for us naval academy cadets in 1920 and 1921, the first to the pacific and the second to europe. during this period she served briefly as the flagship of the 4th battleship division. after returning from the second cruise, kansas was decommissioned and sold for scrap in august 1923 according to the terms of the washington naval treaty.


== design ==

kansas was 456.3 ft (139.1 m) long overall and had a beam of 76.9 ft (23.4 m) and a draft of 24.5 ft (7.5 m). she displaced 16,000 long tons (16,000 t) as designed and up to 17,666 long tons (17,949 t) at full load. the ship was powered by two-shaft triple-expansion steam engines rated at 16,500 indicated horsepower (12,300 kw), with steam provided by twelve coal-fired babcock & wilcox boilers ducted into three funnels. the propulsion system generated a top speed of 18 knots (33 km/h; 21 mph). as built, she was fitted with heavy military masts, but these were quickly replaced by lattice masts in 1909. as completed, she had a crew of 827 officers and men, though this increased to 881 and later to 896.the ship was armed with a main battery of four 12 inch/45 mark 5 guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. the secondary battery consisted of eight 8-inch (203 mm)/45 guns and twelve 7-inch (178 mm)/45 guns. the 8-inch guns were mounted in four twin turrets amidships and the 7-inch guns were placed in casemates in the hull. for close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried twenty 3-inch (76 mm)/50 guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull and twelve 3-pounder guns. she also carried four 37 mm (1.5 in) 1-pounder guns. as was standard for capital ships of the period, kansas carried four 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes, submerged in her hull on the broadside.kansas's main armored belt was 11 in (279 mm) thick over the magazines and the propulsion machinery spaces and 6 in (152 mm) elsewhere. the main battery gun turrets had 12-inch (305 mm) thick faces, and the supporting barbettes had the 10 in (254 mm) of armor plating. the secondary turrets had 7 in (178 mm) of frontal armor. the conning tower had 9 in (229 mm) thick sides.


== service history ==


=== construction and the great white fleet ===

the keel for kansas was laid down at the new york shipbuilding corporation of camden, new jersey. she was launched on 12 august 1905. after completing fitting-out work, the ship was commissioned into the fleet on 18 april 1907 in philadelphia. captain charles e. vreeland was the ship's first commanding officer. she began a shakedown cruise on 17 august off provincetown, massachusetts, that revealed the need for modifications, which began at philadelphia on 24 september. on 9 december, she joined the ships that would be assigned to the great white fleet in hampton roads.on 16 december, kansas steamed out of hampton roads with the great white fleet for a circumnavigation of the globe. the cruise of the great white fleet was conceived as a way to demonstrate american military power, particularly to japan. tensions had begun to rise between the united states and japan after the latter's victory in the russo-japanese war in 1905, particularly over racist opposition to japanese immigration to the united states. the press in both countries began to call for war, and roosevelt hoped to use the demonstration of naval might to deter japanese aggression. the cruise was also intended to assert the united states' status as a global naval power and to convince congress of the need to support increased naval expenditures. the fleet cruised south to the caribbean and then to south america, making stops in port of spain, rio de janeiro, punta arenas, and valparaíso, among other cities. after arriving in mexico in march 1908, the fleet spent three weeks conducting gunnery practice the fleet then resumed its voyage up the pacific coast of the americas, stopping in san francisco and seattle before crossing the pacific to australia, stopping in hawaii on the way. stops in the south pacific included melbourne, sydney, and auckland. the fleet then turned north for the philippines, stopping in manila, before continuing on to japan where a welcoming ceremony was held in yokohama. three weeks of exercises followed in subic bay in the philippines in november. the ships passed singapore on 6 december and entered the indian ocean; they coaled in colombo before proceeding to the suez canal and coaling again at port said, egypt. the fleet called in several mediterranean ports before stopping in gibraltar, where an international fleet of british, russian, french, and dutch warships greeted the americans. the ships then crossed the atlantic to return to hampton roads on 22 february 1909, having traveled 46,729 nautical miles (86,542 km; 53,775 mi). there, they conducted a naval review for president theodore roosevelt.


=== peacetime activities ===

a week after returning from the voyage, kansas steamed to the philadelphia naval shipyard for an overhaul after the lengthy period at sea. the work was completed on 17 june, and kansas thereafter began a peacetime routine of maneuvers and various training exercises that continued throughout the following year. on 15 november 1910, she joined the 2nd battleship division for a cruise to europe, stopping in  cherbourg, france, and portland, england. the ships then recrossed the atlantic, stopping in santo domingo and cuba before continuing on to hampton roads. a second trip to europe took place in mid-1911; this time, the division steamed into the baltic sea, visiting several ports in the region, including copenhagen, denmark, stockholm, sweden, kronstadt, russia, and kiel, germany. the ships arrived back in provincetown on 13 july and thereafter joined fleet training exercises off the virginia capes. kansas steamed to the norfolk navy yard on 3 november for another overhaul.kansas began a series of extensive maneuvers in early 1912, based out of guantanamo bay, cuba. she returned to hampton roads to greet a squadron of german warships—the battlecruiser sms moltke and the light cruisers bremen and stettin—that visited the port from 28 may to 8 june. kansas then embarked on a training cruise along the east coast of the united states for midshipmen from the us naval academy on 21 june. she returned the midshipmen to annapolis on 30 august. on 15 november, she began a training cruise to the gulf of mexico, arriving back in philadelphia for an overhaul on 21 december. she returned to duty on 5 may 1913 and cruised the east coast for the next several months. on 25 october, she crossed the atlantic and cruised the mediterranean sea, which included a stop in genoa, italy. after returning to guantanamo bay, she was sent to the coast of mexico to protect us interests during the mexican revolution. the ship was back in norfolk on 14 march 1914, and another overhaul at philadelphia followed on 11 april. on 1 july, kansas steamed out of norfolk to carry the remains of the recently deceased venezuelan ambassador to the united states back to his home country. she arrived in la guaira on 14 july before returning to the mexican coast to support the forces occupying veracruz. she left the area on 29 october to respond to unrest in port au prince, haiti, arriving on 3 november. she remained there for a month before departing on 1 december for philadelphia. the ship then resumed the normal peacetime routine of training exercises off the east coast and off cuba until 30 september 1916, when she underwent another overhaul in philadelphia.


=== world war i ===

she was still in dry dock when the united states declared war on germany on 6 april 1917. on 10 july, she was assigned to the 4th battleship division (4th batdiv) and was tasked primarily with training naval personnel in the chesapeake bay. in september 1918, she was assigned to convoy escort duty, with the first such mission on 6 september. the ship departed with her sister ship uss new hampshire and the dreadnought uss south carolina to protect a fast hx troopship convoy. on 16 september, the three battleships left the convoy in the atlantic and steamed back to the united states, while other escorts brought the convoy into port. on the 17th, south carolina slipped her starboard propeller, which forced her to reduce speed to 11 knots (20 km/h; 13 mph) using only the port shaft. kansas and new hampshire remained with south carolina to escort her back to port. convoy duty did not last long, as the germans signed the armistice that ended the war on 11 november.following the end of the war in november 1918, she joined the effort to return american soldiers from france, making five trips to brest, france. the first of these took place in december; kansas and the battleship georgia departed on 10 december and arrived in brest on the 22nd. the two ships embarked a total of 2,732 soldiers between them over the course of four days before departing for the return trip. a major overhaul at philadelphia followed from 29 june 1919 to 17 may 1920. she then proceeded to annapolis, arriving on the 20th and embarking midshipmen for another training cruise, this time to the pacific ocean. she passed through the panama canal and visited a number of ports on the west coast, including honolulu, seattle, san francisco, and san pedro. she left san pedro on 11 august bound for the panama canal and crossed into the caribbean for a stop at guantanamo bay. kansas arrived back in annapolis on 2 september, where she disembarked the midshipmen. rear admiral charles frederick hughes raised his flag aboard kansas in philadelphia as the flagship of the 4th batdiv.the ship departed on 27 september for a cruise to the caribbean. while in grassey bay, bermuda on 2 october, edward, prince of wales, visited the ship. on the 4th, she passed through the panama canal and steamed to american samoa, stopping in pago pago, samoa on 11 november. kansas then visited hawaii before crossing back through the panama canal and eventually returning to philadelphia on 7 march 1921. another midshipmen training cruise followed on 4 june; three other battleships joined her for a visit to european waters. stops included oslo, norway, lisbon, portugal, and gibraltar. they passed through guantanamo bay before returning to annapolis on 28 august. a visit to new york followed from 3 to 19 september. she arrived back at philadelphia the following day, where she was decommissioned on 16 december. kansas was stricken from the naval vessel register on 24 august 1923 in accordance with the terms of the washington naval treaty and was subsequently broken up for scrap.

choriogonadotropin subunit beta,protein,"human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) is a hormone for the maternal recognition of pregnancy produced by trophoblast cells that are surrounding a growing embryo (syncytiotrophoblast initially), which eventually forms the placenta after implantation. the presence of hcg is detected in some pregnancy tests (hcg pregnancy strip tests). some cancerous tumors produce this hormone; therefore, elevated levels measured when the patient is not pregnant may lead to a cancer diagnosis and, if high enough, paraneoplastic syndromes, however, it is not known whether this production is a contributing cause, or an effect of carcinogenesis. the pituitary analog of hcg, known as luteinizing hormone (lh), is produced in the pituitary gland of males and females of all ages.various endogenous forms of hcg exist. the measurement of these diverse forms is used in the diagnosis of pregnancy and a variety of disease states. preparations of hcg from various sources have also been used therapeutically, by both medicine and quackery. as of december 6, 2011, the united states food and drug administration has prohibited the sale of ""homeopathic"" and over-the-counter hcg diet products and declared them fraudulent and illegal.beta hcg is initially secreted by the syncytiotrophoblast.


== structure ==
human chorionic gonadotropin is a glycoprotein composed of 237 amino acids with a molecular mass of 36.7 kda, approximately 14.5 αhcg and 22.2kda βhcg.it is heterodimeric, with an α (alpha) subunit identical to that of luteinizing hormone (lh), follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh), thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh), and β (beta) subunit that is unique to hcg.

the α (alpha) subunit is 92 amino acids long.
the β-subunit of hcg gonadotropin (beta-hcg) contains 145 amino acids, encoded by six highly homologous genes that are arranged in tandem and inverted pairs on chromosome 19q13.3 - cgb (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8). it is known that cgb7 has a sequence slightly different from that of the others.the two subunits create a small hydrophobic core surrounded by a high surface area-to-volume ratio: 2.8 times that of a sphere.  the vast majority of the outer amino acids are hydrophilic.beta-hcg is mostly similar to beta-lh, with the exception of a carboxy terminus peptide (beta-ctp) containing four glycosylated serine residues that is responsible for hcg's longer half-life.


== function ==
human chorionic gonadotropin interacts with the lhcg receptor of the ovary and promotes the maintenance of the corpus luteum for the maternal recognition of pregnancy at the beginning of pregnancy. this allows the corpus luteum to secrete the hormone progesterone during the first trimester. progesterone enriches the uterus with a thick lining of blood vessels and capillaries so that it can sustain the growing fetus.due to its highly negative charge, hcg may repel the immune cells of the mother, protecting the fetus during the first trimester. it has also been hypothesized that hcg may be a placental link for the development of local maternal immunotolerance. for example, hcg-treated endometrial cells induce an increase in t cell apoptosis (dissolution of t cells).  these results suggest that hcg may be a link in the development of peritrophoblastic immune tolerance, and may facilitate the trophoblast invasion, which is known to expedite fetal development in the endometrium. it has also been suggested that hcg levels are linked to the severity of morning sickness or hyperemesis gravidarum in pregnant women.because of its similarity to lh, hcg can also be used clinically to induce ovulation in the ovaries as well as testosterone production in the testes. as the most abundant biological source is in women who are presently pregnant, some organizations collect urine from pregnant women to extract hcg for use in fertility treatment. 
human chorionic gonadotropin also plays a role in cellular differentiation/proliferation and may activate apoptosis.


== production ==
naturally, it is produced in the human placenta by the syncytiotrophoblast.
like any other gonadotropins, it can be extracted from the urine of pregnant women or produced from cultures of genetically modified cells using recombinant dna technology.
in pubergen, pregnyl, follutein, profasi, choragon and novarel, it is extracted from the urine of pregnant women. in ovidrel, it is produced with recombinant dna technology.


== hcg forms ==
three major forms of hcg are produced by humans, with each having distinct physiological roles. these include regular hcg, hyperglycosylated hcg, and the free beta-subunit of hcg. degradation products of hcg have also been detected, including nicked hcg, hcg missing the c-terminal peptide from the beta-subunit, and free alpha-subunit, which has no known biological function. some hcg is also made by the pituitary gland with a pattern of glycosylation that differs from placental forms of hcg.regular hcg is the main form of hcg associated with the majority of pregnancy and in non-invasive molar pregnancies.  this is produced in the trophoblast cells of the placental tissue. hyperglycosylated hcg is the main form of hcg during the implantation phase of pregnancy, with invasive molar pregnancies, and with choriocarcinoma. gonadotropin preparations of hcg can be produced for pharmaceutical use from animal or synthetic sources. some of these are medically justified, whereas others are of a quack nature.


== testing ==
blood or urine tests measure hcg. these can be pregnancy tests. hcg-positive indicates an implanted blastocyst and mammalian embryogenesis. these can be done to diagnose and monitor germ cell tumors and gestational trophoblastic diseases.
concentrations are commonly reported in thousandth international units per milliliter (miu/ml). the international unit of hcg was originally established in 1938 and has been redefined in 1964 and in 1980. at the present time, 1 international unit is equal to approximately 2.35×10−12 moles, or about 6×10−8 grams.it is also possible to test for hcg to have an approximation of the gestational age.


=== methodology ===
most tests employ a monoclonal antibody, which is specific to the β-subunit of hcg (β-hcg). this procedure is employed to ensure that tests do not make false positives by confusing hcg with lh and fsh. (the latter two are always present at varying levels in the body, whereas the presence of hcg almost always indicates pregnancy.)
many hcg immunoassays are based on the sandwich principle, which uses antibodies to hcg labeled with an enzyme or a conventional or luminescent dye.
pregnancy urine dipstick tests are based on the lateral flow technique.

the urine test may be a chromatographic immunoassay or any of several other test formats, home-, physician's office-, or laboratory-based.  published detection thresholds range from 20 to 100 miu/ml, depending on the brand of test. early in pregnancy, more accurate results may be obtained by using the first urine of the morning (when urine is most concentrated). when the urine is dilute (specific gravity less than 1.015), the hcg concentration may not be representative of the blood concentration, and the test may be falsely negative.
the serum test, using 2-4 ml of venous blood, is typically a chemiluminescent or fluorimetric immunoassay that can detect βhcg levels as low as 5 miu/ml and allows quantification of the βhcg concentration.


=== reference levels in normal pregnancy ===
the following is a list of serum hcg levels. (lmp is the last menstrual period dated from the first day of the last menstrual period.) the levels grow exponentially after conception and implantation.


=== interpretation ===
the ability to quantitate the βhcg level is useful in the monitoring germ cell and trophoblastic tumors, follow-up care after miscarriage, and diagnosis of and follow-up care after treatment of ectopic pregnancy. the lack of a visible fetus on vaginal ultrasound after the βhcg levels have reached 1500 miu/ml is strongly indicative of an ectopic pregnancy. still, even an hcg over 2000 iu/l does not necessarily exclude the presence of a viable intrauterine pregnancy in such cases.as pregnancy tests, quantitative blood tests and the most sensitive urine tests usually detect hcg between 6 and 12 days after ovulation. it must be taken into account, however, that total hcg levels may vary in a very wide range within the first 4 weeks of gestation, leading to false results during this period. a rise of 35% over 48 hours is proposed as the minimal rise consistent with a viable intrauterine pregnancy.gestational trophoblastic disease like hydatidiform moles (""molar pregnancy"") or choriocarcinoma may produce high levels of βhcg (due to the presence of syncytiotrophoblasts - part of the villi that make up the placenta) despite the absence of an embryo. this, as well as several other conditions, can lead to elevated hcg readings in the absence of pregnancy.
hcg levels are also a component of the triple test, a screening test for certain fetal chromosomal abnormalities/birth defects.
a study of 32 normal pregnancies came to the result a gestational sac of 1–3 mm was detected at a mean hcg level of 1150 iu/l (range 800-1500), a yolk sac was detected at a mean level of 6000 iu/l (range 4500-7500) and fetal heartbeat was visible at a mean hcg level of 10,000 iu/l (range 8650–12,200).


== uses ==


=== tumor marker ===
human chorionic gonadotropin can be used as a tumor marker, as its β subunit is secreted by some cancers including seminoma, choriocarcinoma, germ cell tumors, hydatidiform mole, teratoma with elements of choriocarcinoma, and islet cell tumor. for this reason, a positive result in males can be a test for testicular cancer. the normal range for men is between 0-5 miu/ml. combined with alpha-fetoprotein, β-hcg is an excellent tumor marker for the monitoring of germ cell tumors.

human chorionic gonadotropin injection is extensively used for final maturation induction in lieu of luteinizing hormone. in the presence of one or more mature ovarian follicles, ovulation can be triggered by the administration of hcg. as ovulation will happen between 38 and 40 hours after a single hcg injection, procedures can be scheduled to take advantage of this time sequence, such as intrauterine insemination or sexual intercourse. also, patients that undergo ivf, in general, receive hcg to trigger the ovulation process, but have an oocyte retrieval performed at about 34 to 36 hours after injection by, a few hours before the eggs actually would be released from the ovary.
as hcg supports the corpus luteum, administration of hcg is used in certain circumstances to enhance the production of progesterone.
in the male, hcg injections are used to stimulate the leydig cells to synthesize testosterone. the intratesticular testosterone is necessary for spermatogenesis from the sertoli cells. typical uses for hcg in men include hypogonadism and fertility treatment, including during testosterone replacement therapy to restore or maintain fertility and prevent testicular atrophy.
several vaccines against human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) for the prevention of pregnancy are currently in clinical trials.


==== hcg pubergen, pregnyl warnings ====
in the case of female patients who want to be treated with hcg pubergen, pregnyl:
a) since infertile female patients who undergo medically assisted reproduction (especially those who need in vitro fertilization), are known to often be suffering from tubal abnormalities, after a treatment with this drug they might experience many more ectopic pregnancies. this is why early ultrasound confirmation at the beginning of a pregnancy (to see whether the pregnancy is intrauterine or not) is crucial. pregnancies that have occurred after a treatment with this medicine are submitted to a higher risk of multiplets. female patients who have thrombosis, severe obesity, or thrombophilia should not be prescribed this medicine as they have a higher risk of arterial or venous thromboembolic events after or during a treatment with hcg pubergen, pregnyl. b)female patients who have been treated with this medicine are usually more prone to pregnancy losses.
in the case of male patients: a prolonged treatment with hcg pubergen, pregnyl is known to regularly lead to increased production of androgen. therefore: patients who are suffering from overt or latent cardiac failure, hypertension, renal dysfunction, migraines, or epilepsy might not be allowed to start using this medicine or may require a lower dose of hcg pubergen, pregnyl. also this medicine should be used with extreme caution in the treatment of prepubescent teenagers in order to reduce the risk of precocious sexual development or premature epiphyseal closure. this type of patients' skeletal maturation should be closely and regularly monitored.
both male and female patients who have the following medical conditions must not start a treatment with hcg pubergen, pregnyl: (1) hypersensitivity to this medicine or to any of its main ingredients. (2) known or possible androgen-dependent tumors for example male breast carcinoma or prostatic carcinoma.


=== anabolic steroid adjunct ===
in the world of performance-enhancing drugs, hcg is increasingly used in combination with various anabolic-androgenic steroid (aas) cycles.  as a result, hcg is included in some sports' illegal drug lists.
when exogenous aas are put into the male body, natural negative-feedback loops cause the body to shut down its own production of testosterone via shutdown of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (hpga). this causes testicular atrophy, among other things. hcg is commonly used during and after steroid cycles to maintain and restore testicular size as well as normal testosterone production.high levels of aass, that mimic the body's natural testosterone, trigger the hypothalamus to shut down its production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh) from the hypothalamus. without gnrh, the pituitary gland stops releasing luteinizing hormone (lh). lh normally travels from the pituitary via the blood stream to the testes, where it triggers the production and release of testosterone. without lh, the testes shut down their production of testosterone. in males, hcg helps restore and maintain testosterone production in the testes by mimicking lh and triggering the production and release of testosterone.
if hcg is used for too long and in too high a dose, the resulting rise in natural testosterone and estrogen would eventually inhibit endogenous production of luteinizing hormone via negative feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary gland.professional athletes who have tested positive for hcg have been temporarily banned from their sport, including a 50-game ban from mlb for manny ramirez in 2009 and a 4-game ban from the nfl for brian cushing for a positive urine test for hcg. mixed martial arts fighter dennis siver was fined $19,800 and suspended 9 months for being tested positive after his bout at ufc 168.


=== hcg diet ===
british endocrinologist albert t. w. simeons proposed hcg as an adjunct to an ultra-low-calorie weight-loss diet (fewer than 500 calories). simeons, while studying pregnant women in india on a calorie-deficient diet, and ""fat boys"" with pituitary problems (frölich's syndrome) treated with low-dose hcg, observed that both lost fat rather than lean (muscle) tissue. he reasoned that hcg must be programming the hypothalamus to do this in the former cases in order to protect the developing fetus by promoting mobilization and consumption of abnormal, excessive adipose deposits.  simeons in 1954 published a book entitled pounds and inches, designed to combat obesity. simeons, practicing at salvator mundi international hospital in rome, italy, recommended low-dose daily hcg injections (125 iu) in combination with a customized ultra-low-calorie (500 cal/day, high-protein, low-carbohydrate/fat) diet, which was supposed to result in a loss of adipose tissue without loss of lean tissue.other researchers did not find the same results when attempting experiments to confirm simeons' conclusions, and in 1976 in response to complaints the fda required simeons and others to include the following disclaimer on all advertisements:
these weight reduction treatments include the injection of hcg, a drug which has not been approved by the food and drug administration as safe and effective in the treatment of obesity or weight control. there is no substantial evidence that hcg increases weight loss beyond that resulting from caloric restriction, that it causes a more attractive or ""normal"" distribution of fat, or that it decreases the hunger and discomfort associated with calorie-restrictive diets.
there was a resurgence of interest in the ""hcg diet"" following promotion by kevin trudeau, who was banned  from making hcg diet weight-loss claims by the u.s. federal trade commission in 2008, and eventually jailed over such claims.a 1976 study in the american journal of clinical nutrition concluded that hcg is not more effective as a weight-loss aid than dietary restriction alone.a 1995 meta analysis found that studies supporting hcg for weight loss were of poor methodological quality and concluded that ""there is no scientific evidence that hcg is effective in the treatment of obesity; it does not bring about weight-loss or fat-redistribution, nor does it reduce hunger or induce a feeling of well-being"".on november 15, 2016, the american medical association (ama) passed policy that ""the use of human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) for weight loss is inappropriate.""
there is no scientific evidence that hcg is effective in the treatment of obesity. the meta-analysis found insufficient evidence supporting the claims that hcg is effective in altering fat-distribution, hunger reduction, or in inducing a feeling of well-being. the authors stated “…the use of hcg should be regarded as an inappropriate therapy for weight reduction…” in the authors opinion, “pharmacists and physicians should be alert on the use of hcg for simeons therapy. the results of this meta-analysis support a firm standpoint against this improper indication. restraints on physicians practicing this therapy can be based on our findings.”
according to the american society of bariatric physicians, no new clinical trials have been published since the definitive 1995 meta-analysis.the scientific consensus is that any weight loss reported by individuals on an ""hcg diet"" may be attributed entirely to the fact that such diets prescribe calorie intake of between 500 and 1,000 calories per day, substantially below recommended levels for an adult, to the point that this may risk health effects associated with malnutrition.


==== homeopathic hcg for weight control ====
controversy about, and shortages of, injected hcg for weight loss have led to substantial internet promotion of ""homeopathic hcg"" for weight control. the ingredients in these products are often obscure, but if prepared from true hcg via homeopathic dilution, they contain either no hcg at all or only trace amounts. moreover, it is highly unlikely that oral hcg is bioavailable due to the fact that digestive protease enzymes and hepatic metabolism renders peptide-based molecules (such as insulin and human growth hormone) biologically inert. hcg can likely only enter the bloodstream through injection.
the united states food and drug administration has stated that over-the-counter products containing hcg are fraudulent and ineffective for weight loss. they are also not protected as homeopathic drugs and have been deemed illegal substances. hcg is classified as a prescription drug in the united states and it has not been approved for over-the-counter sales by the fda as a weight loss product or for any other purposes, and therefore neither hcg in its pure form nor any preparations containing hcg may be sold legally in the country except by prescription. in december 2011, fda and ftc started to take actions to pull unapproved hcg products from the market. in the aftermath, some suppliers started to switch to ""hormone-free"" versions of their weight loss products, where the hormone is replaced with an unproven mixture of free amino acids or where radionics is used to transfer the ""energy"" to the final product.


== tetanus vaccine conspiracy theory ==
catholic bishops in kenya are among those who have spread a conspiracy theory asserting that hcg forms part of a covert sterilization program, forcing denials from the kenyan government.in order to induce a stronger immune response, some versions of human chorionic gonadotropin-based anti-fertility vaccines were designed as conjugates of the β subunit of hcg covalently linked to tetanus toxoid. it has been alleged that a non-conjugated tetanus vaccine used in developing countries is laced with a human chorionic gonadotropin based anti-fertility drug and is distributed as a means of mass sterilization.  this charge has been vigorously denied by the world health organization (who) and unicef.  others have argued that a hcg laced vaccine could not be used for sterilization since the effects of the anti-fertility vaccines are reversible (requiring booster doses to maintain immunity) and a non-conjugated vaccine is likely to be ineffective.  finally, independent testing of the tetanus vaccine by kenya's health authorities has revealed no traces of the human chorionic gonadotropin hormone.

alpha 1-antitrypsin injection,drug,"panniculitis is a group of diseases whose hallmark is inflammation of subcutaneous adipose tissue (the fatty layer under the skin – panniculus adiposus). symptoms include tender skin nodules, and systemic signs such as weight loss and fatigue.
restated, an inflammatory disorder primarily localized in the subcutaneous fat is termed a ""panniculitis"", a group of disorders that may be challenging both for the clinician and the dermatopathologist. the general term for inflammation of any adipose tissue is steatitis.


== signs and symptoms ==
panniculitis can also be classified based on the presence or absence of systemic symptoms. panniculitis without systemic disease can be a result of trauma or cold. panniculitis with systemic disease can be caused by:

connective tissue disorders such as lupus erythematosus or scleroderma;
lymphoproliferative disease such as lymphoma or histiocytosis;
pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer;
sarcoidosis with cutaneous involvement (seen in up to 20 percent);
alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency
crohn's diseasethis is not a complete list of possible causes.


=== associated conditions ===
lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy (the loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue) can occur in any of these conditions.


== diagnosis ==


=== classification ===
it can occur in any fatty tissue (cutaneous or visceral) and is often diagnosed on the basis of a deep skin biopsy, and can be further classified by histological characteristics based on the location of the inflammatory cells (within fatty lobules or in the septa which separate them) and on the presence or absence of vasculitis.
there are thus four main histological subtypes:
lobular panniculitis without vasculitis (acute panniculitis, previously termed weber–christian disease, systemic nodular panniculitis)
lobular panniculitis with vasculitis
septal panniculitis without vasculitis
septal panniculitis with vasculitis


==== lobular ====


===== with vasculitis =====
erythema induratum, or ""bazin disease"", is a panniculitis on the back of the calves. it was formerly thought to be a reaction to the tuberculum bacillus. it is now considered a panniculitis that is not associated with a single defined pathogen.nodular vasculitis is a skin condition characterized by small, tender, reddened nodules on the legs, mostly on the calves and shins. microscopically there are epithelioid granulomas and vasculitis in the subcutaneous tissue, making it a form of paniculitis. most of these cases are now thought to be manifestation of tuberculosis and indeed they respond well to anti-tuberculous treatment.


===== without vasculitis =====
non-vasculitis forms of panniculitis that may occur include:

cytophagic histiocytic panniculitis was first described in 1980 by winkelmann as a chronic histiocytic disease of the subcutaneous adipose tissue, which is characterized clinically by tender erythematous nodules, recurrent high fever, malaise, jaundice, organomegaly, serosal effusions, pancytopenia, hepatic dysfunction and coagulation abnormalities. chp may occur either isolated or as part of cutaneous manifestations of hemophagocytic syndrome (hps). chp is a rare and often fatal form of panniculitis with multisystem involvement. but it can also present in a benign form involving only the subcutaneous tissue, thus having a broad clinical spectrum.
traumatic panniculitis is a panniculitis that occurs following trauma to the skin.
cold panniculitis is a panniculitis occurring after exposure to cold, most often seen in infants and young children.  this condition has been described in children who suck ice or popsicles, and therefore is sometimes referred to as ""popsicle panniculitis."" the term was coined when a patient with a rash of unknown origin on her cheek was taken to a dermatologist.
gouty panniculitis is a panniculitis caused by deposition of uric acid crystals in gout.
pancreatic panniculitis (also known as enzymatic panniculitis, pancreatic fat necrosis, and subcutaneous fat necrosis) is a panniculitis most commonly associated with pancreatic carcinoma, and more rarely with anatomic pancreatic abnormalities, pseudocysts, or drug-induced pancreatitis.
factitial panniculitis is a panniculitis that may be induced by the injection of organic materials, povidone, feces, saliva, vaginal fluid, and oils.


==== with needle-shaped clefts ====
lipodermatosclerosis is a form of panniculitis associated with chronic venous insufficiency that presents with brown indurations on the front of the shins. it may be associated with pain and other signs of chronic venous insufficiency. the exact cause is unknown.other forms include:

subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn, a form of panniculitis occurring in newborns that is usually self-resolving, that may be a result of hypoxic injury to relatively high levels of brown fat.
sclerema neonatorum, affecting premature births.
weber–christian disease, a symmetrical form of the disease of unknown origin occurring in middle-aged women.
lupus erythematosus panniculitis, panniculitis associated with lupus erythematosus.
forms associated with use of high doses of systemic corticosteroids during rapid corticosteroid withdrawal, and from the injection of silicone or mineral oils.


==== septal ====


===== erythema nodosum =====

erythema nodosum is a form of panniculitis characterised by tender red nodules, 1–10 cm, associated with systemic symptoms including fever, malaise, and joint pain. nodules may become bluish-purple, yellowing, and green, and subside over a period of 2–6 weeks without ulcerating or scarring. erythema nodosum is associated with infections, including hepatitis c, ebv and tuberculosis, crohn's disease and sarcoidosis, pregnancy, medications including sulfonamides, and some cancers, including non-hodgkin lymphoma and pancreatic cancer.


===== a1at-deficiency-associated =====

alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency panniculitis  is a panniculitis associated with a deficiency of the α1-antitrypsin enzyme.

nucleate cell,cell,"a nucleated red blood cell (nrbc), also known by several other names, is a red blood cell that contains a cell nucleus. almost all vertebrate organisms have hemoglobin-containing cells in their blood, and with the exception of mammals, all of these red blood cells are nucleated. in mammals,  nrbcs occur in normal development as precursors to mature red blood cells in erythropoiesis, the process by which the body produces red blood cells.  nrbcs are normally found in the bone marrow of humans of all ages and in the blood of fetuses and newborn infants. after infancy, rbcs normally contain a nucleus only during the very early stages of the cell's life, and the nucleus is ejected as a normal part of cellular differentiation before the cell is released into the bloodstream. thus, if nrbcs are identified on an adult's  complete blood count or peripheral blood smear, it suggests that there is a very high demand for the bone marrow to produce rbcs, and immature rbcs are being released into circulation.  possible pathologic causes include anemia, myelofibrosis, thalassemia, miliary tuberculosis, cancers involving bone marrow (myelomas, leukemias, lymphomas), and in chronic hypoxemia.


== nomenclature ==
several names are used for nucleated rbcs—erythroblast, normoblast, and megaloblast—with one minor variation in word sense.
 
the name normoblast always refers to normal, healthy cells that are the immediate precursors of normal, healthy, mature (anucleate) rbcs. the name megaloblast always refers to abnormally developed precursors. often the name erythroblast is used synonymously with normoblast, but at other times it is considered a hypernym. in the latter sense, there are two types of erythroblasts: normoblasts as cells that develop as expected, and megaloblasts as unusually large erythroblasts that are associated with illness.


== healthy development ==
there are four stages in the normal development of a normoblast.:


== pathogenesis ==
a megaloblast is an unusually large erythroblast that can be associated with vitamin b12 deficiency (caused by pernicious anemia or dietary insufficiency), folic acid deficiency, or both (such anemias are collectively called megaloblastic anemias). this kind of anemia leads to macrocytes (abnormally large red cells) and the condition called macrocytosis. the cause of this cellular gigantism is an impairment in dna replication that delays nuclear maturation and cell division. because rna and cytoplasmic elements are synthesized at a constant rate despite the cells' impaired dna synthesis, the cells show nuclear-cytoplasmic asynchrony.

balcreuchan port,non_science,"balcreuchan port or balcruachan port (nx0908878) is a bay and raised beach site in the parish of colmonell, close to bennane head and port vad (nx091870) in south ayrshire, scotland. it is well known for its cave (nx099876) with its links to the legend of sawney bean and also for the unusual geology that is found in the bay. it was a minor fishing harbour up until the mid to late 19th century.


== infrastructure ==
the first edition of the os map shows that a channel in the bay that had been cleared of stones to permit the safe landing of boats. the channel remnants are currently still visible at low tide (datum 2020). no other artificial features directly related to the port itself have been observed.


== history ==

the name 'port' is indicative of its use, and balcreuchan is gaelic, with the first 'bal' part meaning a farmstead. a farm of that name is shown slightly inland from the port. the 'creuchan' may be from crìochan, 'borders' or 'bounds' as in na crìochan, 'the borders', and na garbh chrìochan - 'the rough bounds/highlands'. the balcreuchan burn runs to the coast just east of the port up to the area of knockormal hill and the 'lochton' place names suggest a more substantial flow at one time.this remote area is well known for smuggling in the past, and balcreuchan port had a reputation for such activities in association with the existence of the cave.alexander peden was a famous ayrshire covenanter minister who had been captured at a conventicle near remote knockdow not far from balcreuchan port and sentenced to a jail term on the bass rock. he later spent some time in northern ireland and upon his return to scotland in the 1680s he may have landed at balcreuchan bay as the secluded bay he landed at is recorded as having been between ballantrae and lendalfoot, with a shingle beach.


=== the port ===
it is described as a ""small creek or indentation of the sea coast where there is a small flat beach. composed of shingle & boulders."" the scotlands places site records that boats were pulled up onto the beach and secured here in the summer months. port vad nearby has a similar record but it was more exposed to wind and wave action. the nearby enclosure suggests that the bay may have been inhabited during the summer months by fishermen. the transport of stock and materials such as lime for the fields are not on record for the bay.


=== the cave ===
two cave sites are linked with the legend of sawney bean, balcreuchan being often quoted; the other is bennane cave a short distance down the coast towards ballantrae. in some cases the name bennane cave is given; however the description and/or photographs match balcreuchan cave.in the 1970s balcreuchan cave became associated with sawney bean, and this led to a safe path down to the site being created, and the cave was soon after recorded on ordnance survey maps.it is on record in 1912 that tramps and gypsies used balcreuchan cave for overnight stays.the cave itself is damp, and about seventy feet deep and is accessed by a gully through the rocks that is flooded when the tide is high. it is said that the cave once ran for a mile or more into the headland.


=== the enclosure ===

the first os map shows a walled enclosure of about one third of an acre (one eighth of a hectare) located on the raised beach area on the east side of the bay, running up to and sheltered by a headland and well above the spring high tide mark on the raised beach. the enclosure has four or so divisions and sub-divisions. small structures are shown within the area that may be fishermen's huts. a track ran from the entrance to the enclosure along the raised beach area and then up the slope to reach the top of the cliffs, having passed over the cave. a hay ree for storing animal feed is marked on the os map where the nearby balcreuchan burn reaches the sea.
after the first os map the enclosure and track are progressively less detailed, with just an enclosure wall indicated and then the site not marked at all. this may have been a summer dwelling for fishermen with huts or sheds much like the surviving example at the old carleton fishery just up the coast, where a similar clearing of a channel on the beach of stones is shown on the os map.


== the site today ==

the fallen walls of the enclosure are not visible amongst the dense undergrowth, although there are many stones throughout the area. the track from the enclosure and up the cliff slope is not discernable. as stated, the area of channel cleared of stones in the bay can still be made out at low tide. the cave access has been hindered by the fall of a large boulder that must be climbed over to gain access to the cave itself. there are a lot of graffiti on the walls of the cave.
the former kyle and carrick district council opened a safe access path in 1978 and publicised the links with sawney bean, however the port now has no maintained path and access requires appropriate sturdy hill walking footwear and great caution.


== botany ==
the headland above the old enclosure is the location of a rare tree for this area of scotland, the aspen (populus tremula). a clone of the aspen is grows along the summit ridge. part of the bay lies in a site of special scientific interest (sssi).


== geology ==

the rocks here are a section of ancient oceanic crust around 500 million years old. this rare rock formation has formed because a fragment of oceanic crust has been emplaced onto continental crust. in the bay, rocks of the upper mantle progress to igneous rocks of the oceanic crust and finally on to the sedimentary rocks of the ancient sea floor. the rarely exposed rocks of the upper mantle are visible. these are serpentinite rocks that once lay over 5 kilometres beneath the seabed. a major fault separates the serpentinites of the ancient upper mantle and the igneous rocks of the crust, cutting in front of balcreuchan cave which is itself formed in basalt. towards the foreshore a prominent igneous dyke cuts through the softer serpentinite.

macrophage mannose receptor 1 o-glycosylated 6 (human),protein,"the mannose receptor (cluster of differentiation 206, cd206) is a c-type lectin primarily present on the surface of macrophages, immature dendritic cells and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, but is also expressed on the surface of skin cells such as human dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes. it is the first member of a family of endocytic receptors that includes endo180 (cd280), m-type pla2r, and dec-205 (cd205).the receptor recognises terminal mannose, n-acetylglucosamine and fucose residues on glycans attached to proteins  found on the surface of some microorganisms, playing a role in both the innate and adaptive immune systems. additional functions include clearance of glycoproteins from circulation, including sulphated glycoprotein hormones and glycoproteins released in response to pathological events. the mannose receptor recycles continuously between the plasma membrane and endosomal compartments in a clathrin-dependent manner.


== structure ==


=== domain organisation ===

the mannose receptor is a type i transmembrane protein, with an extracellular n-terminus and an intracellular c-terminus. it is first synthesised as an inactive precursor, but is proteolytically cleaved to its active form in the golgi apparatus. the extracellular portion of the receptor is composed of 8 consecutive c-type carbohydrate recognition domains (crds) closest to the plasma membrane, followed by a single fibronectin type ii repeat domain and an n-terminal cysteine-rich domain. the cytoplasmic tail is not capable of signal transduction in isolation, since it lacks the appropriate signaling motifs.


=== n-terminal cysteine-rich domain ===
the n-terminal cysteine-rich domain is homologous to the ricin b chain and binds to sulphated sugar moieties, with particularly high affinity for n-acetylgalactosamine and galactose residues sulphated at positions 3 and 4 of their pyranose rings.other ligands include chondroitin sulfates a and b, as well as sulphated lewisx and lewisa structures. the mannose receptor is the only member of the family in which this domain is functional.


=== fibronectin type ii repeat domain ===
the fibronectin type ii repeat domain is conserved amongst all members of the mannose receptor family. collagens i-iv bind this region with high affinity, while collagen v binds only weakly. through this domain, the mannose receptor internalises collagen in macrophages and liver sinusoidal cells, independent of the lectin activity of the receptor. along with the n-terminal cysteine-rich domain, this domain is the most highly conserved between mice and humans (92%).


=== c-type carbohydrate recognition domains (crds) ===
the 8 tandem crds in the extracellular region of the mannose receptor share only 30% homology with each other. they each contain at least some of the amino acid residues necessary for ca2+ and ligand binding, common to functional c-type crds. only crds 4 and 5 contain all of the residues required for sugar binding, forming a protease-resistant ligand-binding core. the most common ligand is terminal mannose residues, but n-acetylglucosamine and fucose also bind.the main interaction between crd-4 and its sugar ligand is through direct ligation to the conserved ca2+ in the sugar-binding site, in a similar way to the binding mechanism of mannan-binding lectin (mbl). however, a quarter of the free energy of sugar-binding is associated with the hydrophobic stacking interactions formed between one face of the sugar ring and the side chain of a conserved tyrosine residue in the binding site, which is not seen in mbl. despite the similarities in mannose-binding between the mannose receptor and mbl, these differences suggest that mannose-binding by the mannose receptor evolved separately to that of other c-type lectins.individually, the crds bind mannose with only weak affinity. high affinity binding is thought to result from the clustering of multiple crds. this clustering allows for binding of multivalent, branched ligands such as high-mannose n-linked oligosaccharides.


=== conformation ===
it has been suggested that the mannose receptor can exist in at least two different structural conformations. the c-type crds are each separated by linker regions of 10-20 amino acids containing a number of proline residues, whose cyclic side chain is fairly rigid and favours a conformation in which the n-terminal cysteine-rich domain is extended as far away from the plasma membrane as possible.alternatively, interactions between neighbouring crds may hold them in close proximity to one another and cause the extracellular region of the receptor to bend, bringing the n-terminal cysteine-rich domain into close contact with the crds. this would position crds 4 and 5 furthest from the membrane to maximise their interaction with potential ligands. the resistance to proteolysis shown by crds 4 and 5 suggests physical interactions between the two domains does occur, thereby supporting the existence of this u-shaped conformation.it is thought that transitions between these two conformations occur in a ph-dependent manner, regulating ligand selectivity and release during endocytosis. the lower, more acidic ph of early endosomes is thought to be responsible for ligand release.


=== proteolytic processing ===
a functional, soluble form of the mannose receptor is produced upon proteolytic cleavage of the membrane-bound form by metalloproteases found in the extracellular environment.the soluble protein consists of the entire extracellular region of the receptor and it may be involved in transport of mannosylated proteins away from sites of inflammation. shedding of the mannose receptor from macrophages has been shown to be enhanced upon recognition of fungal pathogens such as candida albicans and aspergillus fumigatus, which suggests the soluble form may play a role in fungal pathogen recognition. in this way, the balance between membrane-bound and soluble mannose receptor could affect targeting of fungal pathogens during the course of infection.


=== glycosylation ===
the mannose receptor is heavily glycosylated and its n-linked glycosylation sites are highly conserved between mice and humans, indicating an important role for this post-translational modification. the presence of sialic acid residues on n-linked glycans of the mannose receptor is important for its role in binding both sulphated and mannosylated glycoproteins. sialylation regulates multimerisation of the receptor, which is known to influence binding to sulphated glycoproteins. terminal sialic acid residues are also known to be required for binding to mannosylated glycans. the absence of sialic acid reduces the receptors ability to bind and internalise mannosylated glycans, but does not affect its localisation to the plasma membrane or its endocytic activity.


== function ==


=== phagocytosis of pathogens ===
a number of pathogenic microorganisms, including c. albicans, pneumocystis carinii and leishmania donovani display glycans on their surfaces with terminal mannose residues that are recognised by the c-type crds of the mannose receptor, thereby acting as a marker of non-self. upon recognition, the receptor internalises the bound pathogen and transports it to lysosomes for degradation via the phagocytic pathway. in this way, the mannose receptor acts as a pattern recognition receptor. the presence of a di-aromatic fently (phe-glu-asn-thr-leu-tyr) sequence motif in the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor is vital for its clathrin-mediated internalization. this is supported by the evidence that cos-1 cells transfected with the mannose receptor lacking its c-terminal tail are unable to endocytose c. albicans and p. carinii.surprisingly, mannose receptor knockout mice do not show increased susceptibility to infection, which suggests that the receptor is not essential for phagocytosis. however, its involvement cannot be rejected since other mechanisms may compensate. for example, infection of knockout mice with p. carinii resulted in increased recruitment of macrophages to the site of infection. furthermore, other receptors present on the surface of phagocytic cells, such as dc-sign, signr1 and endo180, exhibit similar ligand binding ability to the mannose receptor and so it is likely that in its absence, these proteins are able to compensate and induce phagocytosis.the ability of the mannose receptor to aid in pathogen internalisation is also thought to facilitate infection by mycobacterium tuberculosis and mycobacterium leprae. these bacteria reside and multiply in macrophages, preventing formation of the phagolysosome to avoid degradation. hence, by mediating their entrance into the macrophage, blocking the mannose receptor helps these pathogens to infect and grow in their target cell.


=== clathrin-mediated endocytosis ===
the crd regions of the mannose receptor on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells remove a number of waste material ranging from soluble macromolecules to large particulate matter. these include lysosomal enzymes, collagen α‐chains, c‐terminal propeptides of type i pro-collagens, and tissue plasminogen activator. binding studies indicate that each liver sinusoidal endothelial cell expresses a surface pool of 20,000-25,000 mannose receptors. the mannose receptor on liver sinusoidal endothelial cell is a rapidly recycling receptor, with a ke (endocytotic rate constant) of 4.12 min-1, which corresponds to a half-life of 10 s for the surface pool of receptor-ligand complexes.as opposed to macrophages that use the mannose receptors for phagocytosis of particulate matter >200 nm, the mannose receptor on liver sinusoidal endothelial cells mediates clathrin‐mediated endocytosis of macromolecules and nanoparticles <200 nm.


=== antigen presentation ===
the mannose receptor may also play a role in antigen uptake and presentation by immature dendritic cells in the adaptive immune system. upon binding to the receptor, mannosylated antigens are internalised and transported to endocytic compartments within the cell for loading onto major histocompatibility complex (mhc) molecules or other related antigen-presentation molecules. an indirect example of this is the processing of the glycolipid antigen lipoarabinomannan, derived from mycobacteria. lipoarabinomannan (lam) is presented to t cells in complex with cd1b, but is also able to bind to the mannose receptor. since the presence of mannan, an alternative ligand, inhibits lam-dependent t cell proliferation, it is suggested that the receptor binds extracellular lam, internalises it and then transports it to endocytic vesicles to be loaded onto cd1b.mature dendritic cells and macrophages use the mannose receptor for antigen presentation in a different way. the cleaved, soluble receptor binds to circulating antigens and directs them to effector cells in lymphoid organs via its cysteine-rich domain, thus activating the adaptive immune system.


=== intracellular signalling ===
the cytoplasmic tail of the mannose receptor does not contain any signalling motifs, yet the receptor has proven to be essential for production of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, indicating a more passive role for the receptor in phagocytosis of pathogens. this suggests that the mannose receptor is assisted by other cell surface receptors in order to trigger a signalling cascade. for example, it has been shown that hek 293 cells co-transfected with human mannose receptor and human toll-like receptor 2 cdna are able to secrete il-8 in response to p. carinii infection, whereas those transfected with either receptor alone did not. it is possible that the two receptors form a complex on the cell surface that facilitates signal transduction upon pathogenic challenge.


=== resolution of inflammation ===
another key role of the mannose receptor is to regulate the levels of molecules released into the circulation during the inflammatory response. in response to pathological events, glycoproteins including lysosomal hydrolases, tissue plasminogen activator and neutrophil myeloperoxidase are released to help fight off any invading microorganisms. once the threat has subsided, these glycoproteins can be damaging to host tissues so their levels in the circulation must be strictly controlled.high-mannose oligosaccharides present on the surface of these glycoproteins act to mark their transient nature, since they are eventually recognised by the mannose receptor and removed from the circulation. mannose receptor knockout mice are less able to clear these proteins, and show increased concentrations of a number of lysosomal hydrolases in the blood.consistent with this function, the mannose receptor is expressed at low levels during inflammation and at high levels during the resolution of inflammation, to ensure inflammatory agents are removed from the circulation only at the appropriate time.


=== clearance of glycoprotein hormones ===
the n-terminal cysteine-rich domain of the mannose receptor plays an important role in the recognition of sulphated glycoprotein hormones and their clearance from the circulation.glycoprotein hormones such as lutropin, which triggers release of the egg during ovulation, must stimulate their receptors in pulses to avoid receptor desensitisation. glycans on their surface are capped with sulphated n-acetylgalactosamine (galnac), making them ligands for the cysteine-rich ricin homology domain of the mannose receptor. this tag ensures a cycle of release, stimulation, and removal from the circulation.knockout mice lacking the enzyme required to add the sulphated galnac capping structure show longer half-lives for lutropin, which results in increased receptor activation and oestrogen production. female knockout mice reach sexual maturity faster than their wild-type counterparts, have a longer oestrus cycle and produce more litters. thus, the sulphated galnac tag is very important in regulating serum concentrations of certain glycoprotein hormones.


== types ==
humans express two types of mannose receptors, each encoded by its own gene:


== applications in health and disease ==
the selective internalisation properties of the mannose receptor indicate a number of potential applications in health and disease. by manipulating the glycosylation of important bioactive proteins to a highly mannosylated state, their serum levels could be tightly regulated and they could be targeted specifically to cells expressing the mannose receptor. there is also potential for use of the mannose receptor as a target for improved macrophage activation and antigen presentation.mrc2/endo180 interacts with basigin/cd147 via its fourth c-type lectin domain to form a molecular epithelial-mesenchymal transition suppressor complex that if disrupted results in the induction of invasive prostate epithelial cell behavior associated with poor prostate cancer survival. increased basement membrane stiffness due to its glycation can also trigger endo180-dependent invasion of prostate epithelial cells and this bio-mechanical mechanism is associated with poor prostate cancer survival. it has been suggested that stabilization of the endo180-cd147 epithelial-mesenchymal transition suppressor complex and targeting of the non-complexed form of endo180 in invasive cells could have therapeutic benefit in the prevention of cancer progression and metastasis.

vascular endothelial growth factor c (mouse),protein,"anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy, also known as anti-vegf therapy or anti-vegf medication, is the use of medications that block vascular endothelial growth factor. this is done in the treatment of certain cancers and in age-related macular degeneration. they can involve monoclonal antibodies such as bevacizumab, antibody derivatives such as ranibizumab (lucentis), or orally-available small molecules that inhibit the tyrosine kinases stimulated by vegf: lapatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib, axitinib, and pazopanib. (some of these therapies target vegf receptors rather than the vegfs.)
both antibody-based compounds and the first three orally available compounds are commercialized.  the latter two, axitinib and pazopanib, are in clinical trials.bergers and hanahan concluded in 2008 that anti-vegf drugs can show therapeutic efficacy in mouse models of cancer and in an increasing number of human cancers. but, ""the benefits are at best transitory and are followed by a restoration of tumour growth and progression.""later studies into the consequences of vegf inhibitor use have shown that, although they can reduce the growth of primary tumours, vegf inhibitors can concomitantly promote invasiveness and metastasis of tumours.az2171 (cediranib), a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor has been shown to have anti-edema effects by reducing the permeability and aiding in vascular normalization.a 2014 cochrane systematic review studied the effectiveness of ranibizumab and pegaptanib, on patients suffering from macular edema caused by central retinal vein occlusion. participants in both treatment groups showed improvement in visual acuity measures and a reduction in macular edema symptoms over six months.


== cancer ==
the most common indication for anti-vegf therapy is cancer, and they are fda and ema approved for many forms of cancer. these medications are one of the most used forms of targeted therapy and are typically used in combination with other medications.


== neovascular age-related macular degeneration ==
ranibizumab, a monoclonal antibody fragment (fab) derived from bevacizumab, has been developed by genentech for intraocular use. in 2006, fda approved the drug for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet amd). the drug had undergone three successful clinical trials by then.in the october 2006 issue of the new england journal of medicine (nejm), rosenfield, et al. reported that monthly intravitreal injection of ranibizumab led to significant increase in the level of mean visual acuity compared to that of sham injection. it was concluded from the two-year, phase iii study that ranibizumab is very effective in the treatment of minimally classic (mc) or occult wet amd (age-related macular degeneration) with low rates of ocular adverse effects.another study published in the january 2009 issue of ophthalmology provides the evidence for the efficacy of ranibizumab. brown, et al. reported that monthly intravitreal injection of ranibizumab led to significant increase in the level of mean visual acuity compared to that of photodynamic therapy with verteporfin. it was concluded from the two year, phase iii study that ranibizumab was superior to photodynamic therapy with verteporfin in the treatment of predominantly classic (pc) wet amd with low rates of ocular adverse effects.although the efficacy of ranibizumab is well-supported by extensive clinical trials, the cost effectiveness of the drug is questioned. since the drug merely stabilizes patient conditions, ranibizumab must be administered monthly. at a cost of $2,000.00 per injection, the cost to treat wet amd patients in the united states is greater than $10.00 billion per year. due to high cost, many ophthalmologists have turned to bevacizumab as the alternative intravitreal agent in the treatment of wet amd.
in 2007, raftery, et al. reported in the british journal of ophthalmology that, unless ranibizumab is 2.5 times more effective the bevacizumab, ranibizumab is not cost-effective. it was concluded that the price of ranibizumab would have to be drastically reduced for the drug to be cost-effective.off-label use of intravitreal bevacizumab has become a widespread treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration. although the drug is not fda-approved for non-oncologic uses, some studies suggest that bevacizumab is effective in increasing visual acuity with low rates of ocular adverse effects. however, due to small sample size and lack of randomized control trial, the result is not conclusive.
in october 2006, the national eye institute (nei) of the national institutes of health (nih) announced that it would fund a comparative study trial of ranibizumab and bevacizumab to assess the relative efficacy and ocular adversity in treating wet amd. this study, called the comparison of age-related macular degeneration treatment trials (catt study), will enroll about 1,200 patients with newly diagnosed wet amd, randomly assigning the patients to different treatment groups.by may 2012, anti-vegf treatment with avastin has been accepted by medicare, is quite reasonably priced, and effective. lucentis has a similar but smaller molecular structure to avastin, and is fda-approved (2006) for treating macd, yet remains more costly, as is the more recent (approved in 2011) aflibercept (eylea). tests on these treatments are ongoing relative to the efficacy of one over another.


== research ==
vegf is also inhibited by thiazolidinediones (used for diabetes mellitus type 2 and related disease), and this effect on granulosa cells gives the potential of thiazolidinediones to be used in ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.a cochrane review seeking to determine the effectiveness of anti-vegf agents such as ranibizumab and bevacizumab on lowering intraocular pressure in patients with neovascular glaucoma was inconclusive, as more research is needed to compare anti-vegf treatments with conventional treatments. a 2017 review update found moderate evidence that in patients suffering from diabetic macular edema, aflibercept may have advantages in improving visual outcomes over bevacizumab and ranibizumab, after one year.anti‐vegf subconjunctival injections have been proposed as a means of controlling wound healing during glaucoma surgery, however the evidence for or against this therapeutic approach is limited and several studies are ongoing.

excretory cell,cell,"a flame cell is a specialized excretory cell found in the simplest freshwater invertebrates, including  flatworms, rotifers and nemerteans; these are the simplest animals to have a dedicated excretory system. flame cells function like a kidney, removing waste materials. bundles of flame cells are called protonephridia.the flame cell has a nucleated cell body, with a ""cup-shaped"" projection, with flagella covering the inner surface of the cup. the beating of these flagella resemble a flame, giving the cell its name. the cup is attached to a tube cell, whose inner surface is also coated in cilia, which help to move liquid through the tube cell. the tube opens externally through a nephropore, or, in the trematoda, into an excretory bladder. the function of these cells is to regulate the osmotic pressure of the worm, and maintain its ionic balance. microvilli in the tube cell may be used to reabsorb some ions.molecules enter the tubule in tube cells through the gap between the flame cell and tube cell for excretion.

apixaban,drug,"apixaban, sold under the brand name eliquis among others, is an anticoagulant medication used to treat and prevent blood clots and to prevent stroke in people with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. specifically it is used to prevent blood clots following hip or knee replacement and in those with a history of prior clots. it is used as an alternative to warfarin and does not require monitoring by blood tests. it is taken by mouth.common side effects include bleeding and nausea. other side effects may include bleeding around the spine and allergic reactions. use is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding. use appears to be relatively safe in those with mild kidney problems. compared to warfarin it has fewer interactions with other medications. it is a direct factor xa inhibitor.apixaban was approved for medical use in the european union in may 2011, and in the united states in december 2012.  in 2018, it was the 66th most commonly prescribed medication in the united states with more than 12 million prescriptions. in december 2019, generic versions were approved in the united states.


== medical uses ==
apixaban is indicated for the following:
to lower the risk of stroke and embolism in people with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.
deep vein thrombosis (dvt) prevention. dvts may lead to pulmonary embolism (pe) in knee or hip replacement surgery patients.
treatment of both dvt and pe.
to reduce the risk of recurring dvt and pe after initial therapy.in the eu, apixaban is indicated for the prevention of venous thromboembolic events (vte) in adults who have undergone elective hip or knee replacement surgery, the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adults with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (nvaf) with one or more risk factors, for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (dvt) and pulmonary embolism (pe) in adults, and for the prevention of recurrent dvt and pe in adults.


=== atrial fibrillation ===
apixaban is recommended by the national institute for health and clinical excellence for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and at least one of the following risk factors: prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, age 75 years or older, diabetes mellitus, or symptomatic heart failure.apixaban and other anticoagulants (dabigatran, edoxaban and rivaroxaban) appear equally effective as warfarin in preventing non-hemorrhagic stroke in people with atrial fibrillation and are associated with lower risk of intracranial bleeding.while apixaban may be used in people with severely decreased kidney function and those on hemodialysis it has not been studied in these groups. full dose apixaban (5 mg [bid]) can be used, unless at least two of the following characteristics apply: patient age is 80 years or older, body weight is 60 kg or less, and serum creatinine is 1.5 mg/dl or higher, in which case dose reduction to 2.5 mg bid is indicated.


== side effects ==


=== bleeding ===
apixaban can increase the risk of bleeding which may be serious and potentially fatal. concurrent use with other medications that affect blood clotting can further increase this risk. this includes medications such as other anticoagulants, heparin, aspirin,  antiplatelet medications, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids).andexanet alfa is a food and drug administration (fda) approved antidote for apixaban in people with uncontrolled and life-threatening bleeding events.


=== spinal puncture ===
following spinal anesthesia or puncture people who are being treated with anti-thrombotic agents are at higher risk for developing a hematoma, which can cause long-term or permanent paralysis. the risk of this may be increased by using epidural or intrathecal catheters after a surgical operation or from the concurrent use of medicinal agents that affect hemostasis.


== mechanism of action ==
apixaban is a highly selective, orally bioavailable, and reversible direct inhibitor of free and clot-bound factor xa. factor xa catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, the final enzyme in the coagulation cascade that is responsible for fibrin clot formation. apixaban has no direct effect on platelet aggregation, but by inhibiting factor xa, it indirectly decreases clot formation induced by thrombin.


== history ==
apixaban was approved for medical use in the european union in may 2011.a new drug application (nda) for the approval of apixaban was submitted to the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) by bristol-myers squibb (bms) and pfizer jointly after conclusion of the aristotle clinical trial in 2011. apixaban was approved for the prevention of stroke in people with atrial fibrillation on december 28, 2012. on march 13, 2014, it was approved for the additional indication of preventing deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in people who have recently undergone knee or hip replacement. on august 21, 2014, the fda approved apixaban for the additional indication of the treatment of recurring deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. during its development the drug was known as bms-562247-01. by late 2019, sales of the product by bms accounted for thirty-percent of their quarterly revenue. in december 2019, the us fda approved a generic version produced jointly by mylan and micro labs.

gray ranks,non_science,"""gray ranks"" (polish: szare szeregi) was a codename for the underground paramilitary polish scouting association (związek harcerstwa polskiego) during world war ii.
the wartime organisation was created on 27 september 1939, actively resisted and fought german occupation in warsaw until 18 january 1945, and contributed to the resistance operations of the polish underground state. some of its members (grupy szturmowe – assault groups) were among the home army's best-trained troops.
though formally independent, the gray ranks worked closely with the government delegation for poland and home army headquarters. the gray ranks had their own headquarters known under the cryptonym pasieka (""bee yard"") staffed by the chief scout of gray ranks plus three to five deputies in the rank of harcmistrz (scoutmaster).


== overview ==
since its organization in 1916, scouts within the polish scouting and guiding association (związek harcerstwa polskiego, zhp) had taken active part in all the conflicts poland was engaged in around this time: great poland uprising, polish-bolshevik war, silesian uprisings, and the polish–ukrainian war.  after the german invasion of poland in 1939, the nazis recognized the zhp as a threat.  polish scouts and guides were branded as criminals and banned.
under the leadership of florian marciniak, the zhp carried on as a clandestine organization.  the wartime scouts evolved into the paramilitary szare szeregi (gray ranks), reporting up through the polish underground state and the armia krajowa resistance.
the codename szare szeregi was adopted in 1940. it was first used by underground scouting in poznań. the name was coined after an early action of the polish scouting association, in which boy scouts distributed propaganda leaflets among germans from lithuania, latvia and estonia who had settled in the homes of poles expelled to the general government. to create confusion, the leaflets had been signed ss—later expanded to szare szeregi, a name that came to be adopted by the entire organization.
older scouts carried out sabotage, armed resistance, and assassinations.  the girl guides formed auxiliary units working as nurses, liaisons and munition carriers.  younger scouts were involved in so-called minor sabotage under the auspice of the wawer organization, which included dropping leaflets or painting the kotwica sign on the walls.  during operation tempest, and especially during the warsaw uprising, the scouts participated in the fighting, and several szare szeregi units were some of the most effective in combat.  the gray ranks also included the white couriers, who between late fall 1939 and mid-1940 helped smuggle many persons out of soviet-occupied southeastern poland into hungary.
in 1940, the soviet union executed most of the boy scouts held at ostashkov prison.
in 1945 the zhp restored its former name and returned to public existence. however, the communist authorities of poland pressured the organization to become a member of the pioneer movement and eventually it was banned in 1949. the only existing part of pre-war zhp during the year of the communist regime was the zhp pgk.


== principles ==
the gray ranks followed the prewar principles of the polish scouting association: service to the people and country, and education and improvement of their skills. in addition to the prewar oath, the following line was added:

""i pledge to you that i shall serve with the grey ranks, safeguard the secrets of the organization, obey orders, and not hesitate to sacrifice my life.""in addition to the scouting moral code, the gray ranks also followed a basic three-step path of action. the program was nicknamed ""dziś - jutro - pojutrze"" (""today - tomorrow - the day after""):

""today"" – struggle for poland's independence
""tomorrow"" – prepare for an all-national uprising and the liberation of poland
""the day after"" – prepare to rebuild poland after the war


== structure ==
the gray ranks' structure was based on the prewar structure of the polish scouting association, modified to suit the new circumstances of occupation and repression. the basic unit was the troop (drużyna), comprising some 20 boys or girls. each troop was composed of several squads (zastępy), each zastęp comprising 7 persons. several troops from a specified area (city district, village or town) formed a district (hufiec), which in turn formed part of a region (chorągiew — literally, a banner or standard). during world war ii, the several units were referred to by their own code-names:

""banner"" (chorągiew) – ul (""beehive"")
""district"" (hufiec) – rój (""swarm"")
""troop"" (drużyna) – rodzina (""family"")
""squad"" (zastęp) – pszczoły (""bees"")the  headquarters of the gray ranks were code-named ""bee yard"" (pasieka), headed by the commander (naczelnik) the gray ranks' successive commanders were:

florian marciniak (27 september 1939 – 6 may 1943)
stanisław broniewski (""orsza""; 12 may 1943 – 3 october 1944)
leon marszałek (3 october 1944 – 18 january 1945)at the apogee of the gray ranks' strength, headquarters commanded 20 banners. to control the movement, the area of prewar poland was divided into departments, each supervising several banners:

western department (wydział zachodni, z) – areas annexed by nazi germany:
pomeranian banner – ul ""lina"" (beehive line)
greater polish – ul ""przemysław"" (beehive przemysław)
łódź – ul ""kominy"" (beehive chimneys)
zagłębie – ul ""barbara"" (beehive barbara)
silesian – ul ""huta"" (beehive steel mill)an additional banner was formed in the general government and commanded all the scouts from greater poland expelled from their homes by the germans (ul ""chrobry"" - beehive chrobry).

eastern department (wydział wschodni, w) – eastern voivodeships of poland
białystok – ul ""biały"" (beehive white)
wilno – ul ""brama"" (beehive gate)
polesie – ul ""błota"" (beehive marshes)
nowogródek – ul ""las"" (beehive forest)
wołyń – ul ""gleba"" (beehive soil)an additional banner was formed for scouts expelled from their homes to the general government (ul złoty – ""gold beehive"").

central poland department (wydział polski centralnej, c)
warsaw – ul ""wisła"" (beehive vistula)
masovian – ul ""puszcza"" (beehive wilderness)
radom – ul ""rady"" (beehive councils)
lublin – ul ""zboże"" (beehive grain)
southern poland department (wydział polski południowej, p)
kielce – ul ""skała"" (beehive rock)
częstochowa – ul ""warta"" (beehive warta)
kraków – ul ""smok"" (beehive dragon)
lwów – ul ""lew"" (beehive lion)coordination among the departments and beehives was directed by inspectors subordinate to the headquarters: eugeniusz stasiecki, edward zurn and kazimierz grenda.


== ranks by age ==

as of 1 may 1944, the gray ranks numbered 8,359 members. initially only older scouts (senior scouts, senior guides, rovers and rangers), aged 17 and up, were admitted. soon, however, younger children were admitted, and in 1942 a new structure was adopted, based largely on the prewar structure of the polish scouting association.


=== zawisza ===

zawisza (plural zawiszacy) was a group of the youngest scouts of the szare szeregi.
troops organised for children between 12 and 14 years of age were code-named zawisza, after zawisza czarny, a medieval polish knight and diplomat. the troops did not take part in active resistance. instead, the children were prepared for auxiliary service for the upcoming all-national uprising and taught in secret schools for their future duties in liberated poland. among the best-known auxiliary troops formed by the zawiszacy was the scouting postal service organised during the warsaw uprising.


=== combat schools ===
the combat schools (bojowe szkoły) comprised youngsters aged 15 to 17. they took part in ""small-sabotage"" operations.  these included propaganda operations directed at the poles, german civilians and german military units. the best-known operations were:

operation wawer-palmiry – a major propaganda campaign which included painting patriotic and anti-german slogans on walls (see also kotwica); distribution of leaflets, posters stickers, and fake issues of supposed german newspapers; intercepting german propaganda megaphones and using them to spread polish propaganda; destroying german flags and other symbols; disrupting german events by setting off fire alarms; and, last but not least, stink-bombing german-operated movie theaters. probably the best-known action was the removal of a german-language plaque that had been attached by the germans to the nicolaus copernicus monument in warsaw, claiming the astronomer for the german nation.
operation n – the distribution of propaganda newspapers and leaflets among german soldiers stationed in poland.
operation wiss (wywiad – informacja szarych szeregów, grey ranks intelligence)—an operation on behalf of home army intelligence, in which combat schools groups carried out surveillance of german military units and their movements. the information that was gathered was passed on to the allies. the operation provided the allies with complete lists of german units, their insignia and approximate complements, including units down to battalion size.other famous operations included marking street lamps as ""nur für deutsche"" (""only for germans""), implying that those who hanged people would themselves be hanged (from street lamps). other operations occurred after the germans began destroying monuments to polish national heroes and historical personalities. these included a monument to jan kiliński, leader of an 18th-century warsaw uprising against the russians during the kościuszko uprising. the germans dismantled the monument and placed it in the cellars of the former national museum, for delivery to a german steel mill. the scouts were notified of where the monument was hidden and overnight marked the walls of the former museum, ""people of warsaw! i am here. kiliński"".
as part of their secret training, the combat schools boys and girls prepared for service with the home army as members of commanders' troops, communication units, and reconnaissance units. during the warsaw uprising, combat schools units in warsaw's downtown district formed a company; in other districts, they formed platoons.


=== assault groups ===

the assault groups (grupy szturmowe), comprising youngsters aged 17 and up, were directly subordinate to the home army's kedyw (directorate of diversion). the groups trained at secret nco schools and officer schools for commanders of motorised and engineering units. most members also studied at underground universities, to gain knowledge necessary to reconstruct poland after the war. the best-known nco schools included  warsaw's agricola.
the assault groups took part in ""major sabotage"", including armed struggle against the occupiers. the assault groups formed the backbone of the home army's special troops. they liberated prisoners from german prisons and transports, blew up railroad bridges, carried out executions ordered by special courts, and fought pitched battles against german forces.
the assault groups in warsaw were organised into several battalions, including the famous ""baszta"", ""zośka"", ""parasol"" and ""wigry"", which later took part in the warsaw uprising and were among the most notable and successful units on the polish side. other units, mainly in the radom-kielce area, joined the partisan units operating in the forests of the świętokrzyskie mountains.


== assault-group operations ==

notable assault-group operations included:

operation arsenal (march 26, 1943), the liberation of the gravely wounded jan bytnar and 24 other prisoners from a gestapo convoy
operation schultz (may 6, 1943), the assassination of ss-obersturmführer herbert schultz
operation lange (may 22, 1943), the assassination of ss-rottenführer ewald lange
operation belt (august 1943 – february 1944), the destruction of thirteen german border outposts
operation bürkl (september 7, 1943), the assassination of ss-oberscharführer franz bürkl
operation kutschera (february 2, 1944), the assassination of ss and police leader franz kutschera
storming and liberation of gęsiówka concentration camp in warsaw (august 5, 1944)

"cd34-negative, cd56-positive, cd117-positive innate lymphoid cell, human",cell,"cd47 (cluster of differentiation 47) also known as integrin associated protein (iap) is a transmembrane protein that in humans is encoded by the cd47 gene. cd47 belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily and partners with membrane integrins and also binds the ligands thrombospondin-1 (tsp-1) and signal-regulatory protein alpha (sirpα). cd-47 acts as a don't eat me signal to macrophages of the immune system which has made it a potential therapeutic target in some cancers, and more recently, for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.cd47 is involved in a range of cellular processes, including apoptosis, proliferation, adhesion, and migration.  furthermore, it plays a key role in immune and angiogenic responses.  cd47 is ubiquitously expressed in human cells and has been found to be overexpressed in many different tumor cells.  expression in equine cutaneous tumors has been reported as well.


== structure ==
cd47 is a 50 kda membrane receptor that has extracellular n-terminal igv domain, five transmembrane domains, and a short c-terminal intracellular tail.  there are four alternatively spliced isoforms of cd47 that differ only in the length of their cytoplasmic tail.form 2 is the most widely expressed form that is found in all circulating and immune cells.  the second most abundant isoform is form 4, which is predominantly expressed in the brain and in the peripheral nervous system.  only keratinocytes expressed significant amounts of form 1.  little is known about the functional significance of this alternative splicing. however, these isoforms are highly conserved between mouse and man, suggesting an important role for the cytoplasmic domains in cd47 function.


== interactions ==


=== thrombospondin (tsp) ===
cd47 is a high affinity receptor for thrombospondin-1 (tsp-1), a secreted glycoprotein that plays a role in vascular development and angiogenesis, and in this later capacity the tsp1-cd47 interaction inhibits nitric oxide signaling at multiple levels in vascular cells. binding of tsp-1 to cd47 influences several fundamental cellular functions including cell migration and adhesion, cell proliferation or apoptosis, and plays a role in the regulation of angiogenesis and inflammation.


=== signal-regulatory protein (sirp) ===
cd47 interacts with signal-regulatory protein alpha (sirpα), an inhibitory transmembrane receptor present on myeloid cells.  the cd47/sirpα interaction leads to bidirectional signaling, resulting in different cell-to-cell responses including inhibition of phagocytosis, stimulation of cell-cell fusion, and t-cell activation.


=== integrins ===
cd47 interacts with several membrane integrins, most commonly integrin αvβ3.  these interactions result in cd47/integrin complexes that affect a range of cell functions including adhesion, spreading and migration.


== function ==


=== tumor cells ===
due to the ubiquitous expression of cd47, signaling differs according to cell type. it is likely that intracellular and membrane-associated partners are crucial in determining the cellular response of cd47 signaling.


==== cell proliferation ====
the role of cd47 in promoting cell proliferation is heavily dependent on cell type as both activation and loss of cd47 can result in enhanced proliferation.
activation of cd47 with tsp-1 increases proliferation of human u87 and u373 astrocytoma cells but not normal astrocytes. additionally, cd47 blocking antibodies inhibit proliferation of unstimulated astrocytoma cells but not normal astrocytes. though the exact mechanism is unclear, it is likely that cd47 promotes proliferation via the pi3k/akt pathway in cancerous cells but not normal cells.loss of cd47 allows sustained proliferation of primary murine endothelial cells and enables these cells to spontaneously reprogram to form multipotent embryoid body-like clusters.  expression of several stem cell markers, including c-myc, is elevated in cd47-null endothelial cells and a human t cell line lacking cd47.  activation of cd47 with tsp-1 in wild-type cells inhibits proliferation and reduces expression of stem cell transcription factors.


==== cell death ====
cd47 ligation leads to cell death in many normal and tumor cell lines via apoptosis or autophagy.
the activation of cd47 induces rapid apoptosis of t cells. jurkat cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) incubated with the monoclonal antibody ad22 results in apoptosis within 3 hours.  however, apoptosis was not observed following culture with other anti-cd47 antibodies.  the apoptosis inducing function of cd47 appears to be dependent on activation of specific epitopes on the extracellular domain.similarly, cd47 ligation rapidly induces apoptosis in b-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll) cells.  treatment with a disulfide-linked antibody dimer induces apoptosis of cd47-positive primary b-cll and leukemic cells (molt-4 and jok-1).  in addition, administration of the antibody prolonged survival of scid mice implanted with jok-1 cells. apoptosis induction appears to be regulated by the hypoxia inducible factor 1α (hif-1α) pathway.the ras-transformed cell lines mdfb6 and b6ras show near complete loss of tsp-1 expression.  activation of cd47 with tsp-1 results in loss of viability in these ras-expressing cells.  affected cells do not exhibit hallmarks of apoptosis but rather autophagy as seen by staining with acridine orange and immunoreactivity for lc3.


==== migration ====
cell migration appears to be universally stimulated by cd47 ligation and activation.  the role of cd47 in cell migration was first demonstrated for neutrophils, where cd47 blocking antibodies inhibited transmigration of neutrophils and monocytes through the endothelium.  these effects were shown to be dependent on avb3 integrins, which interact with and are activated by cd47 at the plasma membrane.originally discovered by irving weissman’s group at stanford university, blocking cd47 function has been shown to inhibit migration and metastasis in a variety of tumor models.  blockade of cd47 by neutralizing antibodies reduced migration and chemotaxis in response to collagen iv in melanoma, prostate cancer and ovarian cancer-derived cells. in a mouse model of multiple myeloma, tumor metastasis to bone was decreased in cd47-deficient mice compared with wild type controls.  in work led by mark chao and ash alizadeh, at stanford, mice were xenografted with human non-hodgkin lymphoma (nhl) cells; blocking cd47 function with shrna or antibodies led to a dramatic reduction in metastasis to major organs.


=== stromal cells ===


==== angiogenesis ====
loss of cd47 promotes proliferation and increases asymmetric division of primary murine endothelial cells.  additionally, activation of cd47 with tsp-1 in wild-type primary mouse cerebral endothelial cells induces cytotoxicity, which is significantly decreased in cerebral endothelial cells derived from cd47 knockout mice.cd47 signaling may suppress angiogenesis as tsp-1 activation significantly inhibited endothelial cell migration and tube formation in vitro.  in vivo, injections of tsp-1 in mice after hindlimb ischemia induces a significant decrease of blood flow recovery.  the mechanism of the anti-angiogenic activity of cd47 is not fully understood, but introduction of cd47 antibodies and tsp-1 have been shown to inhibit nitric oxide (no)-stimulated responses in both endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells. cd47 signaling influences the sdf-1 chemokine pathway, which plays a role in angiogenesis.


==== inflammatory response ====
interactions between endothelial cell cd47 and leukocyte sirpγ regulate t cell transendothelial migration (tem) at sites of inflammation.  cd47 knockout mice show reduced recruitment of blood t cells as well as neutrophils and monocytes in areas of inflammation.  cd47 also functions as a marker of self on murine red blood cells which allows rbc to avoid phagocytosis. red blood cells that lack cd47 are rapidly cleared from the bloodstream by macrophages, a process that is mediated by interaction with sirpα. mouse hematopoietic stem cells (hscs) and progenitors transiently upregulate cd47 during their migratory phase, which reduces macrophage engulfment in vivo.tumor cells can also evade macrophage phagocytosis through the expression of cd47.  cd47 is highly expressed in bladder tumor initiating cells (t-ics) compared with the rest of the tumor.  blockade of cd47 with a monoclonal antibody results in macrophage engulfment of bladder cancer cells in vitro. cd47 is also upregulated in mouse and human myeloid leukemias, and overexpression of cd47 on a myeloid leukemia line allows these cells to evade phagocytosis.


== clinical significance ==
cd47 was first identified as a tumor antigen on human ovarian cancer in the 1980s. since then, cd47 has been found to be expressed on multiple human tumor types including acute myeloid leukemia (aml), chronic myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all), non-hodgkin's lymphoma (nhl), multiple myeloma (mm), bladder cancer, and other solid tumors. cd47 is also highly expressed on pediatric and adult brain tumors.high levels of cd47 allows cancer cells to avoid phagocytosis despite having a higher level of calreticulin - the dominant pro-phagocytic signal. this is due to engagement of the sirp-α of macrophage by cd47. engagement of sirp-α leads to inhibition of phagocytosis. thus blocking cd47 with antibody turns off “don’t eat me” signal and favors phagocytosis.


=== as a potential drug target ===
anti-cd47 antibody–mediated phagocytosis of cancer by macrophages can initiate an antitumor t-cell immune response. noteworthy, anti-cd47 antibody treatment not only enables macrophage phagocytosis of cancer, but also fosters the activation of cancer-specific lymphocytes: cancer cells now display mutant proteins to which the immune system can react. based on significant activity in preclinical models and in synergistic combinations with other antibodies, humanized anti-cd47 antibody is being evaluated for the treatment of various cancers, e.g. diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl) and follicular lymphoma (fl).

ted gunderson,non_science,"theodore l. gunderson (7 november 1928 – 31 july 2011) was an american federal bureau of investigation special agent in charge and head of the los angeles fbi. according to his son, he worked the case of marilyn monroe and the john f. kennedy cases. he was the author of the best-selling book how to locate anyone anywhere without leaving home.


== early life and fbi ==
ted gunderson was born in colorado springs. he graduated from the university of nebraska–lincoln in 1950.  gunderson joined the federal bureau of investigation in december 1951 under j. edgar hoover. he served in the mobile, knoxville, new york city, and albuquerque offices. he held posts as an assistant special agent-in-charge in new haven and philadelphia. in 1973 he became the head of the memphis fbi office and then the head of the dallas fbi office in 1975. ted gunderson was appointed the head of the los angeles fbi in 1977. in 1979 he was one of a handful interviewed for the job of fbi director, which ultimately went to william h. webster.


== post-fbi ==
after retiring from the fbi, gunderson set up a private investigation firm, ted l. gunderson and associates, in santa monica. in 1980, he became a defense investigator for green beret doctor jeffrey r. macdonald, who had been convicted of the 1970 murders of his pregnant wife and two daughters. gunderson obtained affidavits from helena stoeckley confessing to her involvement in the murders which she claimed had in actuality been perpetrated by a satanic cult of which she was a member. he also investigated the most expensive criminal case in u.s. history at the time, the mcmartin preschool trial in manhattan beach, california, which resulted in no convictions. 
in a 1995 conference in dallas, gunderson warned about the proliferation of secret occultist groups, and the danger posed by the new world order, an alleged shadow government that would be controlling the united states government. he also claimed that a ""slave auction"" in which children were sold by saudi arabian agents to men had been held in las vegas, that four thousand ritual human sacrifices are performed in new york city every year, and that the 1995 bombing of the alfred p. murrah federal building in oklahoma city was carried out by the u.s. government. gunderson stated that in the united states, there is a secret widespread network of groups who kidnap children and infants and subject them to ritual abuse and subsequent human sacrifice.in the court case of labella v. fbi (2012), gunderson submitted an affidavit stating, among other things, that ""thousands of victims have been targeted by an illegal government rogue criminal enterprise that is active 24 hours a day within the u.s. ... whose administrators can instantly initiate surveillance, phone taps and harassment against any individual in the country.""


== personal life ==
gunderson had an association with music producer anthony j. hilder and was interviewed by him on various occasions. the two men appeared at numerous conferences together. they both said that the 1993 world trade center bombing was a result of fbi agent provocateurs.gunderson was a member of the constitution party.
in 2008, gunderson stated that he had tested positive for arsenic and cyanide poisoning. dr. edward lucidi, a medical doctor treating gunderson, stated that gunderson's fingers were turning black, a characteristic symptom of arsenic poisoning. dr. lucidi, along with published medical journals, also states that a common effect of arsenic poisoning is bladder cancer. on july 31, 2011 gunderson's son reported that his father had died from bladder cancer.

"bowen, queensland",non_science,"bowen is a coastal town and locality in the whitsunday region on the eastern coast of queensland, australia.  the locality is a large one, and contains two other towns, heronvale (20.107°s 148.2933°e﻿ / -20.107; 148.2933﻿ (heronvale, queensland)) and merinda (20.0164°s 148.1647°e﻿ / -20.0164; 148.1647﻿ (merinda, queensland)). the abbot point coal shipping port is also within the locality. at the 2016 census, bowen had a population of 10,377.


== geography ==
bowen is located on the north-east coast, in north queensland, australia, at exactly twenty degrees south of the equator.  bowen is halfway between townsville and mackay, and 1,130 kilometres (700 mi) by road from brisbane.
bowen sits on a square peninsula, with the coral sea to the north, east, and south. to the south-east is port denison and edgecumbe bay. on the western side, where the peninsula connects with the mainland, the don river's alluvial plain provides fertile soil that supports a prosperous farming industry.
merinda is a hinterland town 10.3 kilometres (6.4 mi) west of the town of bowen.the bruce highway enters the locality from the east, approaches but does not enter the town of bowen itself, but then turns west to pass through merinda before exiting the locality to the north-west. the north coast railway line follows a similar route through the locality but enters the town of bowen which is served by the bowen railway station. at merinda railway station, there is the junction with the collinsville-newlands railway line servicing the bowen basin coalfields. the collinsville-newlands line extends to the coal-handling port at abbot point, also within the locality of bowen. the railway station servicing the port is the abbot point railway station.heronvale is a small coastal town 21.6 kilometres (13.4 mi) by road south of the town of bowen, accessed via the bruce highway and then heronvale road.in the west of the locality is the mount aberdeen national park.two of bowen's main streets are named after officers of the british colonial paramilitary native police force. powell street is named after lieutenant walter david taylor powell and williams street is named after lieutenant ewan g. williams.


== economy ==
the town enjoys a diversified and prosperous economy based on agriculture, fishing, tourism, and mining.  its unusually dry climate for a tropical location, plus its fertile alluvial soil, makes it the ideal place to grow a wide variety of small crops, including tomatoes, rockmelons (i.e., cantaloupes), and capsicums (i.e., bell peppers). outside the alluvial plain, much of the bowen area is used for beef cattle.
just north of bowen is the abbot point coal loading port.  coal mined inland of bowen in collinsville and other towns in the bowen basin is brought by rail to a deepwater pier to be loaded on bulk carriers.  coal is exported mainly to china and india.


== government ==
in 1944, bowen elected a communist, fred paterson, to queensland legislative assembly. he was re-elected in 1947, but lost the seat in 1950 when the boundaries were changed to include bowen in the seat of whitsunday.
bowen was the administrative centre for the shire of bowen. on 15 march 2008, under the local government (reform implementation) act 2007 passed by the parliament of queensland on 10 august 2007, the shire of bowen merged with the shire of whitsunday to form the whitsunday region. although proserpine is the administrative centre for the new regional council, the council maintains offices in bowen and holds a number of council meetings in bowen each year.


== history ==
biri (also known as birri) is a language of central and north queensland. biri refers to a language chain extending from central queensland towards townsville and is often used as a universal name for other languages and/or dialects across the region. the language area includes the towns of bowen, ayr, collinsville and nebo.yuru (also known as juru, euronbba, juru, mal mal, malmal) is an australian aboriginal language spoken on yuru country. the yuru language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the shire of burdekin, including the town of home hill.


=== british exploration and incursion ===
captain james cook named cape gloucester on his voyage of exploration up the australian coast in 1770.  this ""cape"" turned out to be an island, and gloucester island dominates the view from bowen's eastern beaches.  behind the island is a bay that forms an excellent port, which the town came to be built around.
shipwreck survivor, james morrill, resided briefly in the area around the year 1850 with the local aboriginal clan during his seventeen years living as a castaway.in 1859 captain henry daniel sinclair led an expedition to the area in response to a reward offered by the colony of new south wales for finding a port somewhere north of rockhampton. they came across a ""most splendid harbour"" which sinclair named port denison after the colonial governor of new south wales, william denison. on the shore they found ""several acres of ground resembling a garden...full of a vegetable resembling nuts"" which the local aboriginal people had constructed.on 11 september 1860, george elphinstone dalrymple on his naval excursion in the schooner spitfire to search for the mouth of the burdekin river, landed in port denison. he named and climbed mount gordon to survey the region and observed that a river (later named the don river) traversed a valley just behind port denison and into the sea. this river was ""lined with camps and bush fires of the natives"" indicating ""the locality to be very thickly inhabited"".  the spitfire continued its exploration north to magnetic island, but the surveyors came to the conclusion that the northeastern shore of port denison was the most suitable site in the region for settlement especially as the large native wells present in a creek bed there could be utilised as a water supply. on 5 october, dalrymple again came ashore to appropriate control of these wells. he wrote that:

           ""as i approached the beach a number of armed natives appeared to wish to dispute our landing, but as the object in view was a necessity, i..formed open line and advanced. the natives..retired at our approach into a small strip of scrub commanding the wells. this we entered in the same order, cleared it and placed sentries..""
confident in having secured a beach-head, dalrymple explored the immediate vicinity near the wells that was to become the town of bowen. he found a large aboriginal tomb in the hills behind the beach that was in the form of a raised mound covered in bark with its surroundings swept clean and the paths leading to it closed off with branches. a similar tomb was found on nearby stone island. after a few days, dalrymple and his surveying party on the spitfire returned south.


=== establishment of the town ===

in 1861, george elphinstone dalrymple set out again for the area, leading an overland expedition from rockhampton, complemented with a naval contingent to rendezvous at port denison and establish a permanent settlement. dalrymple planned this two pronged entry into the area because 'a sudden cooperation of land and sea forces..would either strike terror, which would result in immediate flight, or enable a blow to be struck' against the local aboriginal people of which many had been seen camped around the harbour. to facilitate this plan, dalrymple travelled with lieutenant williams and six native police troopers, while lieutenant walter powell and his troopers travelled on the ships. these ships were the jeannie dove and the santa barbara under the command of capt. mcdermott. 
the maritime group arrived first and waited for dalrymple's overland party by camping on stone island at the mouth of the harbour. dalrymple's group, which included 140 horses and 121 cattle, arrived on 11 april 1861. he rode down to the area on the foreshore 'beside the native wells' (which was to be the water supply of the settlement) in order 'to clear off the aborigines from the same, should such be necessary' and to signal mcdermott's group on stone island. the local aboriginal people had already fled. the settlers on stone island then came over to the site and the town of port denison was founded. dalrymple wrote that it was 'deeply gratifying to me to see the british flag flying over the spot where..a few days ago, the wild aboriginal held undisputed sway', and that the settlement marked 'the advance of another great wave of anglo-australian energy'.within the first six weeks of colonisation, the native police and armed colonists conducted at least six operations against the aboriginal people in the area, driving them off the land and also pursuing them by sea. in one of these missions, the whole available force in the town was utilised in an engagement where a large group of aboriginal people were ""speedily put to rout with a loss sufficient to teach them a severe and it is hoped, useful lesson."" newspapers published reports that the local aboriginal population were ""wretched caricatures of the human race...faithless stewards of the fine property on which they horde,"" and that it was ""the duty of civilisation to occupy the soil which they disregard and disgrace,"" and that ""force and even severity may be necessary to restrain their brutal disposition.""  pastoralists were quick to enter the region through this new port and mark out land acquisitions in the hinterland, while buildings within the township were rapidly constructed.after queensland had separated from new south wales, the town was renamed bowen after the first queensland colonial governor, sir george bowen. port denison post office opened in april 1861 and was renamed bowen by 1865.between the 1860s and the 1880s, early colonists and settlers forecasted bowen as the ""capital of a new north queensland colony"". relics of this particular ambition can be seen today in bowen's exacting road grid and town plan, and the avenue-like width of it's central streets. 


=== shipwrecks ===
in 1863, settlers in the area encountered a sailor, james morrill, who had been shipwrecked 17 years previously on a shoal in the coral sea. he had made it to the queensland coast on a makeshift raft with a few companions. the others had all died within two years, but morrill lived with the local aborigines in the townsville area. rejoining european society after white settlement began in north queensland, he settled in bowen. his grave is in the bowen cemetery.
the coral reefs around bowen are the scene of several shipwrecks, including the ss gothenburg, which sank in 1875 with a loss of more than 100 lives.  numerous relics of bowen's history, from the aboriginal past onwards, are on display at the bowen historical society's museum.


=== schools ===
bowen state school opened in 1865. between 1877 and 1922, it operated as two schools: bowen boys state school and bowen girls and infants state school. a secondary department was added to bowen state school in 1928. on 23 january 1961, the secondary department was replaced by bowen state high school.st mary's school was opened on 1 september 1872 by sister m. gertrude and sister m. de sales, both members of the sisters of st joseph of the sacred heart founded by mother mary mackillop. following to ongoing conflict between mackillop and james quinn, the roman catholic archbishop of brisbane, over who controlled the schools operated by the sisters in queensland, quinn expelled the sisters from his diocese in 1880 and they returned to south australia where the order was first established. quinn established a group of diocesan sisters using the name sisters of the holy family who operated the school under quinn's direct authority until 1885, when the sisters of mercy took over the running of the school withsister mary modwena taylor, sister m. stanislaus kostka harding and sister m. winifred duggan being transferred from the range convent school in rockhampton.merinda provisional school opened in 1898 and became merinda state school on 1 january 1909. queens beach state school opened on 25 november 1940.


=== world war 2 ===

during world war 2 bowen hosted an air force base, flying pby catalina flying boats to search for enemy ships and submarines. the concrete aprons and ramp are still present.


== heritage listings ==
bowen has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:

flemington road: flemington road cemetery
6 herbert street: bowen harbour board building
46 herbert street: bowen post office
29 kennedy street: bowen state school
30 williams street: bowen courthouse


== population ==
according to the 2016 census of population, there were 10,377 people in bowen.

aboriginal and torres strait islander people made up 9.2% of the population.
74.2% of people were born in australia. the next most common countries of birth were new zealand 2.4%, england 2.0%, south korea 1.3%, philippines 1.1% and taiwan 1.0%.
81.5% of people only spoke english at home. other languages spoken at home included mandarin 1.5% and korean 1.2%,
the most common responses for religion were no religion 25.8%, catholic 20.5% and anglican 17.6%.


== climate ==
the town has a tropical savannah climate (köppen climate classification: aw).  it is noticeably drier than surrounding locations due to a rain shadow effect produced by the nearby gloucester island.  due to the town's latitude, the trade winds provide a pleasant breeze. the warmest month is january, with an average maximum temperature of 31.5 °c (88.7 °f).  the coolest month is july, with an average maximum temperature of 24.5 °c (76.1 °f) and an average overnight minimum of 13.3 °c (55.9 °f).


== television ==
bowen is serviced by six free to air channels. bowen picks up regional affiliates and can possibly pick up brisbane channels.
the brisbane channels are:

seven brisbane (btq)
nine brisbane (qtq)
ten brisbane (tvq)the regional affiliates are:

seven queensland (stq)
win television
southern cross nine


== tourism ==
bowen is on a peninsula, with ocean on three sides.  this gives eight beaches surrounding the town, namely kings beach, queens beach, horseshoe bay, murrays bay, greys bay, rose bay, and the front beach.  there is also the clothing-optional coral bay. kings beach offers views of nearby gloucester island. 
the ""big mango"", costing $90,000 to create, was erected in 2002 as a tourist attraction at the bowen tourist information centre. in february 2014, the 10-metre high, seven-tonne fibreglass structure was reported to be ""stolen"" as part of a publicity stunt for the region. 


=== australia ===
in december 2006, it was announced that bowen was chosen as a filming location for part of the production of australia, directed by baz luhrmann and starring nicole kidman and hugh jackman. bowen was chosen as a prospect due to the financing of $500,000 by the queensland government. the production moved to bowen on 14 may 2007; the town was used to depict 1940's darwin.

hatching gland cell,cell,"in humans, implantation is the stage of pregnancy at which the embryo adheres to the wall of the uterus. at this stage of prenatal development, the conceptus is called a blastocyst. it is by this adhesion that the embryo receives oxygen and nutrients from the mother to be able to grow.
in humans, implantation of a fertilized ovum is most likely to occur around nine days after ovulation; however, this can range between six and 12 days.


== implantation window ==
the reception-ready phase of the endometrium of the uterus is usually termed the ""implantation window"" and lasts about 4 days. the implantation window occurs around 6 days after the peak in luteinizing hormone levels. with some disparity between sources, it has been stated to occur from 7 days after ovulation until 9 days after ovulation, or days 6-10 postovulation. on average, it occurs during the 20th to the 23rd day after the last menstrual period.the implantation window is characterized by changes to the endometrium cells, which aid in the absorption of the uterine fluid. these changes are collectively known as the plasma membrane transformation and bring the blastocyst nearer to the endometrium and immobilize it. during this stage the blastocyst can still be eliminated by being flushed out of the uterus. scientists have hypothesized that the hormones cause a swelling that fills the flattened out uterine cavity just prior to this stage, which may also help press the blastocyst against the endometrium. the implantation window may also be initiated by other preparations in the endometrium of the uterus, both structurally and in the composition of its secretions.


== adaptation of uterus ==
to enable implantation, the uterus goes through changes in order to be able to receive the conceptus.


=== predecidualization ===
the endometrium increases thickness, becomes vascularized and its glands grow to be tortuous and boosted in their secretions. these changes reach their maximum about 7 days after ovulation.
furthermore, the surface of the endometrium produces a kind of rounded cells, which cover the whole area toward the uterine cavity. this happens about 9 to 10 days after ovulation. these cells are called decidual cells, which emphasises that the whole layer of them is shed off in every menstruation if no pregnancy occurs, just as leaves of deciduous trees. the uterine glands, on the other hand, decrease in activity and degenerate around 8 to 9 days after ovulation in absence of pregnancy.
the decidual cells originate from the stromal cells that are always present in the endometrium. however, the decidual cells make up a new layer, the decidua. the rest of the endometrium, in addition, expresses differences between the luminal and the basal sides. the luminal cells form the zona compacta of the endometrium, in contrast to the basalolateral zona spongiosa, which consists of the rather spongy stromal cells.


=== decidualization ===
decidualization succeeds predecidualization if pregnancy occurs. this is an expansion of it, further developing the uterine glands, the zona compacta and the epithelium of decidual cells lining it. the decidual cells become filled with lipids and glycogen and take the polyhedral shape characteristic for decidual cells.


==== trigger ====
it is likely that the blastocyst itself makes the main contribution to this additional growing and sustaining of the decidua. an indication of this is that decidualization occurs at a higher degree in conception cycles than in nonconception cycles. furthermore, similar changes are observed when giving stimuli mimicking the natural invasion of the embryo.the embryo releases serine proteases which causes the epithelial cell membrane to depolarize and activates the epithelial na+ channel. this triggers a ca2+ influx and phosphorylation of creb. phosphorylation of creb upregulates the expression of cox-2, which leads to the release of prostaglandin e2 (pge2) from epithelial cells. pge2 acts on the stroma cells activating camp-related pathways in stromal cell leading to decidualization.


==== parts of decidua ====
the decidua can be organized into separate sections, although they have the same composition.

decidua basalis - this is the part of the decidua which is located basalolateral to the embryo after implantation.
decidua capsularis - decidua capsularis grows over the embryo on the luminal side, enclosing it into the endometrium. it surrounds the embryo together with decidua basalis.
decidua parietalis - all other decidua on the uterine surface belongs to decidua parietalis.


=== decidua throughout pregnancy ===
after implantation the decidua remains, at least through the first trimester. however, its most prominent time is during the early stages of pregnancy, during implantation. its function as a surrounding tissue is replaced by the definitive placenta. however, some elements of the decidualization remain throughout pregnancy.the compacta and spongiosa layers are still observable beneath the decidua in pregnancy. the glands of the spongiosa layer continue to secrete during the first trimester, when they degenerate. however, before that disappearance, some glands secrete unequally much. this phenomenon of hypersecretion is called the arias-stella phenomenon, after the pathologist javier arias-stella.


=== pinopodes ===

pinopodes are small, finger-like protrusions from the endometrium. they appear between day 19 and day 21 of gestational age. this corresponds to a fertilization age of approximately five to seven days, which corresponds well with the time of implantation. they only persist for two to three days. the development of them is enhanced by progesterone but inhibited by estrogens.


==== function in implantation ====
pinopodes endocytose uterine fluid and macromolecules in it. by doing so, the volume of the uterus decreases, taking the walls closer to the embryoblast floating in it. thus, the period of active pinocytes might also limit the implantation window.


==== function during implantation ====
pinopodes continue to absorb fluid, and removes most of it during the early stages of implantation.


== adaptation of secretions ==
not only the lining of the uterus transforms, but in addition, the secretion from its epithelial glands changes. this change is induced by increased levels of progesterone from the corpus luteum. the target of the secretions is the embryoblast, and has several functions on it.


=== nourishment ===
the embryoblast spends approximately 72 hours in the uterine cavity before implanting. in that time, it cannot receive nourishment directly from the blood of the mother, and must rely on secreted nutrients into the uterine cavity, e.g. iron and fat-soluble vitamins.


=== growth and implantation ===
in addition to nourishment, the endometrium secretes several steroid-dependent proteins, important for growth and implantation. cholesterol and steroids are also secreted. implantation is further facilitated by synthesis of matrix substances, adhesion molecules and surface receptors for the matrix substances.


== mechanism ==
implantation is initiated when the blastocyst comes into contact with the uterine wall.


=== zona hatching ===

to be able to perform implantation, the blastocyst first needs to get rid of its zona pellucida. this process can be called ""hatching"".


==== factors ====
lytic factors in the uterine cavity, as well as factors from the blastocyst itself are essential for this process. mechanisms in the latter are indicated by that the zona pellucida remains intact if an unfertilized egg is placed in the uterus under the same conditions. a substance probably involved is plasmin. plasminogen, the plasmin precursor, is found in the uterine cavity, and blastocyst factors contribute to its conversion to active plasmin. this hypothesis is supported by lytic effects in vitro by plasmin. furthermore, plasmin inhibitors also inhibit the entire zona hatching in rat experiments.


=== apposition ===
the very first, loose connection between the blastocyst and the endometrium is called the apposition.


==== location ====
on the endometrium, the apposition is usually made where there is a small crypt in it, perhaps because it increases the area of contact with the rather spherical blastocyst.
on the blastocyst, on the other hand, it occurs at a location where there has been enough lysis of the zona pellucida to have created a rupture to enable direct contact between the underlying trophoblast and the decidua of the endometrium. however, ultimately, the inner cell mass, inside the trophoblast layer, is aligned closest to the decidua. nevertheless, the apposition on the blastocyst is not dependent on if it is on the same side of the blastocyst as the inner cell mass. rather, the inner cell mass rotates inside the trophoblast to align to the apposition. in short, the entire surface of the blastocyst has a potential to form the apposition to the decidua.


==== molecular mechanism ====
the identity of the molecules on the trophoblast and the endometrial epithelia that mediate the initial interaction between the two remain unidentified. however, a number of research groups have proposed that muc1, a member of the mucin family of glycosylated proteins, is involved. muc1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed at the apical surface of endometrial epithelial cells during the window of implantation in humans and has been shown to be differentially expressed between fertile and infertile subjects during this time. muc1 displays carbohydrate moieties on its extracellular domain that are ligands of l-selectin, a protein expressed on the surface of trophoblast cells. an in vitro model of implantation developed by genbacev et al., gave evidence to support the hypothesis that l-selectin mediates apposition of the blastocyst to the uterine epithelium by interacting with its ligands.


=== adhesion ===
adhesion is a much stronger attachment to the endometrium than the loose apposition.
the trophoblasts adhere by penetrating the endometrium, with protrusions of trophoblast cells.
this adhering activity is by microvilli that are on the trophoblast. the trophoblast have binding fiber connections, laminin, collagen type iv, and integrins that assist in this adhesion process muc16 is a transmembrane mucin expressed at the apical surface of uterine epithelia. this mucin prevents the blastocyst from implanting in an undesired located on the epithelium. thus, muc16 inhibits cell-cell adhesion. “removal of this mucin during formation of uterodomes (bulbous projections from the apical surface of the epithelium that are often found during the implantation period) facilitates trophoblast adhesion in vitro”.


==== communication ====
there is massive communication between the blastocyst and the endometrium at this stage. the blastocyst signals to the endometrium to adapt further to its presence, e.g. by changes in the cytoskeleton of decidual cells. this, in turn, dislodges the decidual cells from their connection to the underlying basal lamina, which enables the blastocyst to perform the succeeding invasion.this communication is conveyed by receptor-ligand-interactions, both integrin-matrix and proteoglycan ones.


===== proteoglycan receptors =====
another ligand-receptor system involved in adhesion is proteoglycan receptors, found on the surface of the decidua of the uterus. their counterparts, the proteoglycans, are found around the trophoblast cells of the blastocyst. this ligand-receptor system also is present just at the implantation window.


=== invasion ===
invasion is an even further establishment of the blastocyst in the endometrium.


==== syncytiotrophoblasts ====
the protrusions of trophoblast cells that adhere into the endometrium continue to proliferate and penetrate into the endometrium. as these trophoblast cells penetrate, they differentiate to become a new type of cells, syncytiotrophoblast. the prefix syn- refers to the transformation that occurs as the boundaries between these cells disappear to form a single mass of many cell nuclei (a syncytium). the rest of the trophoblasts, surrounding the inner cell mass, are hereafter called cytotrophoblasts. syncytiotrophoblast is not determined as a cell type, rather is a multinucleated tissue invasion continues with the syncytiotrophoblasts reaching the basal membrane beneath the decidual cells, penetrating it and further invading into the uterine stroma. finally, the whole embryo is embedded in the endometrium. eventually, the syncytiotrophoblasts come into contact with maternal blood and form chorionic villi. this is the initiation of forming the placenta.
the penetration of the trophoblast to the endometrium is demonstrated through metalloproteinase mmp-2 and mmp-9  syncytiotrophoblast invade the uterus attempting to reach maternal blood supply, for setting up the foundation for fetal blood flow 


==== extravillous trophoblasts ====
extravillous trophoblasts are cells from the invading villi that migrate into the myometrium of the mother’s uterus. these cells remodel the spiral arteries to improve and secure maternal blood flow to the growing embryo. there is also evidence that this process occurs with the uterine veins, stabilizing them to improve drainage of fetal blood and metabolic wastes. trophoblasts have also been documented to migrate into the mother and have been found in various tissues. due to this trophoblasts have been implicated in a phenomenon known as “fetomaternal microchimerism” where fetal cells establish cell lines in maternal tissues.


==== secretions ====
the blastocyst secretes factors for a multitude of purposes during invasion. it secretes several autocrine factors, targeting itself and stimulating it to further invade the endometrium. furthermore, secretions loosen decidual cells from each other, prevent the embryo from being rejected by the mother, trigger the final decidualization and prevent menstruation.


===== autocrine =====
human chorionic gonadotropin is an autocrine growth factor for the blastocyst. insulin-like growth factor 2, on the other hand, stimulates the invasiveness of it.


===== dislodging =====
the syncytiotrophoblasts dislodges decidual cells in their way, both by degradation of cell adhesion molecules linking the decidual cells together as well as degradation of the extracellular matrix between them.
cell adhesion molecules are degraded by syncytiotrophoblast secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. this inhibits the expression of cadherins and beta-catenin. cadherins are cell adhesion molecules, and beta-catenin helps to anchor them to the cell membrane. inhibited expression of these molecules thus loosens the connection between decidual cells, permitting the syncytotrophoblasts and the whole embryo with them to invade into the endometrium.
the extracellular matrix is degraded by serine endopeptidases and metalloproteinases. examples of such metalloproteinases are collagenases, gelatinases and stromelysins. these collagenases digest type-i collagen, type-ii collagen, type-iii collagen, type-vii collagen and type-x collagen. the gelatinases exist in two forms; one digesting type-iv collagen and one digesting gelatin.


===== immunosuppressive =====
the embryo differs from the cells of the mother, and would be rejected as a parasite by the immune system of the mother if it didn't secrete immunosuppressive agents. such agents are platelet-activating factor, human chorionic gonadotropin, early pregnancy factor, immunosuppressive factor, prostaglandin e2, interleukin 1-alpha, interleukin 6, interferon-alpha, leukemia inhibitory factor and colony-stimulating factor.


===== decidualization =====
factors from the blastocyst also trigger the final formation of decidual cells into their proper form. in contrast, some decidual cells in the proximity of the blastocyst degenerate, providing nutrients for it.


===== prevention of menstruation =====
human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) not only acts as an immunosuppressive, but also ""notifies"" the mother's body that she is pregnant, preventing menstruation by sustaining the function of the corpus luteum.


===== other factors =====
other factors secreted by the blastocyst are;

embryo-derived histamine-releasing factor
tissue plasminogen activator as well as its inhibitors
estradiol
β1-integrins
fibroblast growth factor
cytl1
transforming growth factor alpha
inhibin
preimplantation factor


== failure ==
implantation failure is considered to be caused by inadequate uterine receptivity in two-thirds of cases, and by problems with the embryo itself in the other third.inadequate uterine receptivity may be caused by abnormal cytokine and hormonal signaling as well as epigenetic alterations. recurrent implantation failure is a cause of female infertility. therefore, pregnancy rates can be improved by optimizing endometrial receptivity for implantation. evaluation of implantation markers may help to predict pregnancy outcome and detect occult implantation deficiency.luteal support is the administration of medication, generally progestins, for the purpose of increasing the success rate of implantation and early embryogenesis, thereby complementing the function of the corpus luteum.
in women with more than 3 implantation failures in assisted reproduction, a review of several small randomized controlled studies estimated that the use of adjunct low molecular weight heparin (lmwh) improves live birth rate by approximately 80%.

"hardscrabble, colorado",non_science,"hardscrabble was a settlement established by traders and trappers in the 1840s below the fork of adobe and hardscrabble creeks of present-day custer county, colorado. it was called san buenaventura de los tres arrollos—for three creeks newlin, adobe, and hardscrabble—by its founders, george simpson, joseph doyle, and alexander barclay. the name hardscrabble became more common.it was built on the former site of a bent brothers trading post and near the fort le duc trading post. houses were built together to form a square, as a protection from attack by arapaho and ute people. teresita sandoval and a british trader, alexander barclay, lived at hardscrabble beginning in 1844. after lawrence lupton left his fort lupton trading post in 1845, he came to hardscrabble to farm and run the trading post in 1848. he and his family left for california in 1849.

hardscrabble was visited in november 1848 by john c. frémont. at that time, many inhabitants had moved away as it was too far from the santa fe trail to garner much trade business. the hardscrabble marker, installed by the arkansas valley chapter of the daughters of the american revolution, is located near the site of the extinct settlement.

ammonium chloride / licorice root extract lozenge,drug,"salty liquorice, salmiak liquorice or salmiac liquorice, is a variety of liquorice flavoured with the ingredient ""salmiak salt"" (sal ammoniac; ammonium chloride), and is a common confection found in the nordic countries, benelux, and northern germany. salmiak salt gives salty liquorice an astringent, salty taste (hence the name); akin to that of tannins—a characteristic of red wines, which adds both bitterness and astringency to the flavour. consuming salmiak liquorice can stimulate either a savoury or non-savoury palate and response. anise oil can also be an additional main ingredient in salty liquorice. extra salty liquorice is additionally coated with salmiak salt or salmiak powder, or sometimes table salt.
salty liquorice candy and pastilles are almost always black or very dark brown and can range from soft candy to hard pastille variety, and sometimes hard brittle. the other colours used are white and variants of grey. salty liquorice or salmiak is also used as a flavouring in other products, such as ice creams, syrups, chewing gum, snus and alcoholic beverages.


== history ==
sal ammoniac (ammonium chloride) has a history of being used as a cough medicine, as it works as an expectorant. finnish author jukka annala speculates that salty liquorice has its origins in pharmacy stores that manufactured their own cough medicine. where and when ammonium chloride and liquorice were first combined to produce salty liquorice is unclear, but by the 1930s it was produced in finland, norway, denmark, sweden and the netherlands as a pastille.


== types ==
different languages often refer to salty liquorice as either ""salmiak liquorice"" (swedish: salmiaklakrits; danish: salmiaklakrids), or simply ""salt liquorice"" (swedish: saltlakrits; danish: saltlakrids). the dutch refer to it as ""zoute drop"" or even a variety called ""dubbel zoute drop"" (double salted liquorice). in germany, they are commonly known as salt liquorice (salzlakritz) candy and salmiak pastilles (salmiakpastillen) or simply salmiak, in contrast to sweet liquorice (süßlakritz) candy. a traditional shape for salty liquorice pastilles is a black diamond-shaped lozenge. in finnish, it is known as salmiakki.
the strength of the confectionery depends on the amount of food grade ammonium chloride (salmiak salt) used, which varies by country and what's considered a safe amount. in sweden, for example, the most popular types of salty liquorice contain an average of 7% of ammonium chloride. in 2012, there was a european union proposal to limit the amount to 0.3%, which was met with wide opposition. although the european union now regulates the use of ammonium chloride to 0.3% in most foodstuffs, there is no specific restriction for it in liquorice or ice cream. at a level of up to 7.99% ammonium chloride, salmiak pastilles are considered a ""traditionally-applied medicine to assist expectoration in the airways"".
an antibacterial effect can be attributed to the neutralization of the slightly acidic ammonium chloride (ph about 5.5) by the relatively alkaline saliva (ph about 7), whereby ammonia is released, which has a disinfecting effect:

=== germany and european union ===
before implementation of the current european union community-wide list of permitted flavouring substances used in food, national food legislation in germany required that a content from above 2% ammonium chloride (salmiak salt) in salty liquorice, was required to carry the label ""adult liquorice - not children's liquorice"" (erwachsenenlakritz - kein kinderlakritz) on packaging in germany. when the ingredient content of ammonium chloride (salmiak salt) was between 4.49% and 7.99%, the declaration ""extra strong"" (extra stark) was also required on packaging. more than 7.99% of ammonium chloride (salmiak salt) was not permitted in germany.


== other uses ==

in addition to being used in candy, salmiak is also used to flavour vodka, chocolate, distilled rye brandy, ice cream, cola drinks, snus, and meat.

glycerin nasal spray,drug,"panthenol (also called pantothenol) is the alcohol analog of pantothenic acid (vitamin b5), and is thus a provitamin of b5. in organisms it is quickly oxidized to pantothenic acid. it is a viscous transparent liquid at room temperature. panthenol is used as a moisturizer and to improve wound healing in pharmaceutical and cosmetic products.


== uses ==

in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and personal-care products, panthenol is a moisturizer and humectant, used in ointments, lotions, shampoos, nasal sprays, eye drops, lozenges, and cleaning solutions for contact lenses.
in ointments it is used for the treatment of sunburns, mild burns, minor skin injuries and disorders (in concentrations of up to 2–5%). it improves hydration, reduces itching and inflammation of the skin, improves skin elasticity, and accelerates epidermal wounds' rate of healing. for this purpose, it is sometimes combined with allantoin.
it binds to the hair shaft readily; so, it is a common component of commercial shampoos and hair conditioners (in concentrations of 0.1–1%). it coats the hair and seals its surface, lubricating the hair shaft and giving it a shiny appearance.
it is also recommended by tattoo artists as a post-tattooing moisturising cream.


== adverse effects ==
panthenol is generally well tolerated. in rare cases, skin irritation and contact allergies have been reported.


== pharmacology ==
panthenol readily penetrates into the skin and mucous membranes (including the intestinal mucosa), where it is quickly oxidized to pantothenic acid. pantothenic acid is extremely hygroscopic, that is, it binds water effectively. it is also used in the biosynthesis of coenzyme a, which plays a role in a wide range of enzymatic reactions and thus in cell growth.


== physical and chemical properties ==

panthenol is an odourless, slightly bitter, highly viscous, transparent and colourless liquid at room temperature, but salts of pantothenic acid (for example sodium pantothenate) are powders (typically white). it is easily soluble in water and alcohol, moderately soluble in diethyl ether, soluble in chloroform (1:100), in propylene glycol, and slightly soluble in glycerin.
panthenol's expanded chemical formula is ho–ch2–c(ch3)2–ch(oh)–conh–ch2ch2ch2–oh.


=== stereochemistry ===
panthenol comes in two enantiomers, d and l. only d-panthenol (dexpanthenol) is biologically active, however both forms have moisturizing properties. for cosmetic use, panthenol comes either in d form, or as a racemic mixture of d and l (dl-panthenol).

dichlorodifluoromethane gas for inhalation,drug,"1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (also known as norflurane (inn), r-134a, freon 134a, forane 134a, genetron 134a, florasol 134a, suva 134a, or hfc-134a) is a hydrofluorocarbon (hfc) and haloalkane refrigerant with thermodynamic properties similar to r-12 (dichlorodifluoromethane) but with insignificant ozone depletion potential and a lower 100-year global warming potential (1,430, compared to r-12's gwp of 10,900). it has the formula cf3ch2f and a boiling point of −26.3 °c (−15.34 °f) at atmospheric pressure.  r-134a cylinders are colored light blue.  a phaseout and transition to hfo-1234yf and other refrigerants, with gwps similar to co2, began in year 2012 within the automotive market.


== uses ==
1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane is a non-flammable gas used primarily as a ""high-temperature"" refrigerant for domestic refrigeration and automobile air conditioners.  these devices began using 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane in the early 1990s as a replacement for the more environmentally harmful r-12.  retrofit kits are available to convert units that were originally r-12-equipped.

other common uses include plastic foam blowing, as a cleaning solvent, a propellant for the delivery of pharmaceuticals (e.g. bronchodilators), wine cork removers, gas dusters (""canned air""), and in air driers for removing the moisture from compressed air.  1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane has also been used to cool computers in some overclocking attempts. it is the refrigerant used in plumbing pipe freeze kits. it is also commonly used as a propellant for airsoft airguns. the gas is often mixed with a silicone-based lubricant.


=== aspirational and niche applications ===
1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane is also being considered as an organic solvent suitable for extraction of flavor and fragrance compounds, as a possible alternative to other organic solvents and supercritical carbon dioxide.
it can also be used as a solvent in organic chemistry, both in liquid and supercritical fluid.
it is used in the resistive plate chamber particle detectors in the large hadron collider. it is also used for other types of particle detectors, e.g. some cryogenic particle detectors. it can be used as an alternative to sulfur hexafluoride in magnesium smelting as a shielding gas.1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane is also being considered as an alternative to sulfur hexafluoride as a dielectric gas. its arc-quenching properties are poor, but its dielectric properties are fairly good.


== history and environmental impacts ==
1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane first appeared in the early 1990s as a replacement for dichlorodifluoromethane (r-12), which has ozone depleting properties. it has insignificant ozone depletion potential (ozone layer) and negligible acidification potential (acid rain).   it has a 100-year global warming potential of 1430 and an approximate atmospheric lifetime of 14 years.   its concentration in the atmosphere and contribution to radiative forcing have been growing since its introduction.  it is included in the ipcc list of greenhouse gases.

1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane is subject to use restrictions.   the society of automotive engineers (sae) has proposed that it be best replaced by a new fluorochemical refrigerant hfo-1234yf (cf3cf=ch2) in automobile air-conditioning systems. r-134a is due to be banned from use in the european union, starting with cars in 2011 and due to be banned completely by 2030. by model year 2021, newly manufactured light-duty vehicles in the united states will no longer use r-134a.california may also prohibit the sale of canned r-134a to individuals to avoid non-professional recharge of air conditioners. a ban had been in place in wisconsin since october 1994 under atcp 136 prohibiting sales of container sizes holding less than 15 lbs of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, but this restriction applied only when the chemical was intended to be a refrigerant. however, the ban was lifted in wisconsin in 2012. during the time that it was active, this wisconsin-specific ban contained loopholes.  for example, it was legal for a person to purchase gas duster containers with any amount of the chemical because in that instance the chemical is neither intended to be a refrigerant  nor is hfc-134a included in the § 7671a listing of class i and class ii substances.


== production and reactions ==
tetrafluoroethane is typically made by reacting trichloroethylene with hydrogen fluoride:
chcl=ccl2 + 4 hf → cf3ch2f + 3 hclit reacts with butyllithium to give trifluorovinyl lithium:
cf3ch2f + 2 buli → cf2=cfli + lif  +  2 buh


== safety ==

mixtures with air of the gas 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane are not flammable at atmospheric pressure and temperatures up to 100 °c (212 °f). however, mixtures with high concentrations of air at elevated pressure and/or temperature can be ignited. contact of 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane with flames or hot surfaces in excess of 250 °c (482 °f) may cause vapor decomposition and the emission of toxic gases including hydrogen fluoride and carbonyl fluoride, however the decomposition temperature has been reported as above 370 °c,. 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane itself has an ld50 of 1,500 g/m3 in rats, making it relatively non-toxic, apart from the dangers inherent to inhalant abuse.  its gaseous form is denser than air and will displace air in the lungs. this can result in asphyxiation if excessively inhaled. this contributes to most deaths by inhalant abuse.
aerosol cans containing 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, when inverted, become effective freeze sprays. under pressure, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane is compressed into a liquid, which upon vaporization absorbs a significant amount of thermal energy. as a result, it will greatly lower the temperature of any object it contacts as it evaporates.


== medical use ==
for its medical uses, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane has the generic name norflurane.  it is used as propellant for some metered dose inhalers. it is considered safe for this use. in combination with pentafluoropropane, it is used as a topical vapocoolant spray for numbing boils before curettage. it has also been studied as a potential inhalational anesthetic, but it is nonanaesthetic at doses used in inhalers.

hyphal cell,cell,"a hypha (plural hyphae, from greek ὑφή, huphḗ, ""web"") is a long, branching filamentous structure of a fungus, oomycete, or actinobacterium. in most fungi, hyphae are the main mode of vegetative growth, and are collectively called a mycelium.


== structure ==
a hypha consists of one or more cells surrounded by a tubular cell wall.  in most fungi, hyphae are divided into cells by internal cross-walls called ""septa"" (singular septum). septa are usually perforated by pores large enough for ribosomes, mitochondria, and sometimes nuclei to flow between cells. the major structural polymer in fungal cell walls is typically chitin, in contrast to plants and oomycetes that have cellulosic cell walls.  some fungi have aseptate hyphae, meaning their hyphae are not partitioned by septa.
hyphae have an average diameter of 4–6 µm.


== growth ==
hyphae grow at their tips. during tip growth, cell walls are extended by the external assembly and polymerization of cell wall components, and the internal production of new cell membrane. the spitzenkörper is an intracellular organelle associated with tip growth. it is composed of an aggregation of membrane-bound vesicles containing cell wall components. the spitzenkörper is part of the endomembrane system of fungi, holding and releasing vesicles it receives from the golgi apparatus.  these vesicles travel to the cell membrane via the cytoskeleton and release their contents (including various cysteine-rich proteins including cerato-platanins and hydrophobins) outside the cell by the process of exocytosis, where it can then be transported to where it is needed. vesicle membranes contribute to growth of the cell membrane while their contents form new cell wall. the spitzenkörper moves along the apex of the hyphal strand and generates apical growth and branching; the apical growth rate of the hyphal strand parallels and is regulated by the movement of the spitzenkörper.as a hypha extends, septa may be formed behind the growing tip to partition each hypha into individual cells. hyphae can branch through the bifurcation of a growing tip, or by the emergence of a new tip from an established hypha.


== behavior ==
the direction of hyphal growth can be controlled by environmental stimuli, such as the application of an electric field.  hyphae can sense reproductive units from some distance, and grow towards them.  hyphae can weave through a permeable surface to penetrate it.


== modifications ==
hyphae may be modified in many different ways to serve specific functions. some parasitic fungi form haustoria that function in absorption within the host cells. the arbuscules of mutualistic mycorrhizal fungi serve a similar function in nutrient exchange, so are important in assisting nutrient and water absorption by plants. ectomycorrhizal extramatrical mycelium greatly increases the soil area available for exploitation by plant hosts by funneling water and nutrients to ectomycorrhizas, complex fungal organs on the tips of plant roots.  hyphae are found enveloping the gonidia in lichens, making up a large part of their structure. in nematode-trapping fungi, hyphae may be modified into trapping structures such as constricting rings and adhesive nets. mycelial cords can be formed to transfer nutrients over larger distances. bulk fungal tissues, cords, and membranes, such as those of mushrooms and lichens, are mainly composed of felted and often anastomosed hyphae.


== types ==


=== classification based on cell division ===
septate (with septa)
aspergillus and many other species have septate hyphae.
aseptate or coenocytic (without septa)
non-septate hyphae are associated with mucor, some zygomycetes, and other fungi.
""pseudohyphae"" are distinguished from true hyphae by their method of growth, relative frailty and lack of cytoplasmic connection between the cells.
yeast can form pseudohyphae. they are the result of a sort of incomplete budding where the cells elongate but remain attached after division. some yeasts can also form true septate hyphae.


=== classification based on cell wall and overall form ===
characteristics of hyphae can be important in fungal classification. in basidiomycete taxonomy, hyphae that comprise the fruiting body can be identified as generative, skeletal, or binding hyphae.
generative hyphae are relatively undifferentiated and can develop reproductive structures.  they are typically thin-walled, occasionally developing slightly thickened walls, usually have frequent septa, and may or may not have clamp connections. they may be embedded in mucilage or gelatinized materials.
skeletal hyphae are of two basic types.  the classical form is thick-walled and very long in comparison to the frequently septate generative hyphae, which are unbranched or rarely branched, with little cell content.  they have few septa and lack clamp connections. fusiform skeletal hyphae are the second form of skeletal hyphae. unlike typical skeletal hyphae these are swollen centrally and often exceedingly broad, hence giving the hypha a fusiform shape.
binding hyphae are thick-walled and frequent branched. often they resemble deer antlers or defoliated trees because of the many tapering branches.based on the generative, skeletal and binding hyphal types, in 1932 e. j. h. corner applied the terms monomitic, dimitic, and trimitic to hyphal systems, in order to improve the classification of polypores.
every fungus must contain generative hyphae.  a fungus which only contains this type, as do fleshy mushrooms such as agarics, is referred to as monomitic.
skeletal and binding hyphae give leathery and woody fungi such as polypores their tough consistency.  if a fungus contains all three types (example: trametes), it is called trimitic.
if a fungus contains generative hyphae and just one of the other two types, it is called dimitic.  in fact dimitic fungi almost always contain generative and skeletal hyphae; there is one exceptional genus, laetiporus that includes only generative and binding hyphae.fungi that form fusiform skeletal hyphae bound by generative hyphae are said to have sarcodimitic hyphal systems.  a few fungi form fusiform skeletal hyphae, generative hyphae, and binding hyphae, and these are said to have sarcotrimitic hyphal systems.  these terms were introduced as a later refinement by e. j. h. corner in 1966.


=== classification based on refractive appearance ===
hyphae are described as ""gloeoplerous"" (""gloeohyphae"") if their high refractive index gives them an oily or granular appearance under the microscope.  these cells may be yellowish or clear (hyaline).  they can sometimes selectively be coloured by sulphovanillin or other reagents.  the specialized cells termed cystidia can also be gloeoplerous.


=== classification based on growth location ===
hyphae might be categorized as 'vegetative' or 'aerial.' aerial hyphae of fungi produce asexual reproductive spores.

davis mountains state park,non_science,"davis mountains state park is a 2,709-acre (1,096 ha) state park located in the davis mountains in jeff davis county, texas. the closest town is fort davis, texas. the park elevation is between 5,000 and 6,000 ft (1,500 and 1,800 m) above sea level. the original portion of the park was deeded to texas parks and wildlife department by a local family. 
original improvements were accomplished by the civilian conservation corps (ccc) in 1933, during the great depression. after this federal investment, the park was opened to the public around 1938. indian lodge was expanded and campground facilities were added by the state in 1967.


== history ==
interest in developing a state park in the davis mountains began in earnest in 1923 when the texas legislature directed the newly created state parks board to investigate the area. however, the parks board failed to secure any land donations and had no appropriations to buy the land. 
by 1933, the great depression had so devastated the local economy that landowners agreed to donate 560 acres for the park. ccc companies 879 and 881 arrived in june 1933 and began organizing their encampment, which they named camp washington seawell, after the first commander of nearby fort davis. their developments in the park included roads, an overlook shelter, two mess halls, stone picnic tables, fireplaces and steps, a latrine and ""indian lodge,"" a motel and visitor facility.


== features ==

the park is next to the fort davis national historic site and the two are connected by four miles of hiking trails. within the park is the ""indian lodge"", an adobe motel with thirty-nine rooms. sixteen were built by the civilian conservation corps during the 1930s (completed in 1939) and twenty-four were added in a 1967 expansion by texas parks and wildlife. a large bird blind next to the main road offers enclosed and open viewing areas for the many species of birds that are attracted to the feeders near the blind.
the park has seven miles of equestrian trails in the special use limpia canyon primitive area, the section of the park north of texas state highway 118.


=== flora ===

odontoclast,cell,"an osteoclast (from ancient greek  ὀστέον (osteon) 'bone', and  κλαστός (clastos) 'broken') is a type of bone cell that breaks down bone tissue.  this function is critical in the maintenance, repair, and remodelling of bones of the vertebral skeleton. the osteoclast disassembles and digests the composite of hydrated protein and mineral at a molecular level by secreting acid and a collagenase, a process known as bone resorption. this process also helps regulate the level of blood calcium.
osteoclasts are found on those surfaces of bone which are undergoing resorption. on such surfaces, the osteoclasts are seen to be located in shallow depressions called resorption bays (howship's lacunae). the resorption bays are created by erosive action of osteoclasts on the underlying bone. the border of the lower part of an osteoclast exhibits finger-like processes due to presence of deep infoldings of the cell membrane; this border is called ruffled border. the ruffled border lies in contact with the bone surface within a resorption bay. the periphery of the ruffled border is surrounded by a ring-like zone of cytoplasm which is devoid of cell organelles but is rich in actin filaments. this zone is called clear zone or sealing zone. the actin filaments enable the cell membrane surrounding the sealing zone to be anchored firmly to the bony wall of howship's lacunae. in this way, a closed subosteoclastic compartment is created between the ruffled border and the bone that is undergoing resorption. the osteoclasts secrete hydrogen ions, collagenase, cathepsin k and hydrolytic enzymes into this compartment. resorption of bone matrix by the osteoclasts involves two steps: (1) dissolution of inorganic components (minerals), and (2) digestion of organic component of the bone matrix. the osteoclasts pump hydrogen ions into subosteoclastic compartment and thus create an acidic microenvironment, which increases solubility of bone mineral, resulting in the release and re-entry of bone minerals into the cytoplasm of osteoclasts to be delivered to nearby capillaries. after the removal of minerals, collagenase and gelatinase are secreted into the subosteoclastic compartment. these enzymes digest and degrade collagen and other organic components of decalcified bone matrix. the degradation products are phagocytosed by osteoclasts at the ruffled border. because of their phagocytic properties, osteoclasts are considered to be a component of the mononuclear phagocyte system (mps). the activity of osteoclasts is controlled by hormones and cytokines. calcitonin, a hormone of thyroid gland, suppresses the osteoclastic activity. the osteoclasts do not have receptors for parathyroid hormone (pth). however, pth stimulates the osteoblasts to secrete  the cytokine called osteoclast-stimulating factor, which is a potent stimulator of the osteoclastic activity.an odontoclast (/odon·to·clast/; o-don´to-klast) is an osteoclast associated with absorption of the roots of deciduous teeth.


== structure ==

an osteoclast is a large multinucleated cell and human osteoclasts on bone typically have five nuclei and are 150–200 µm in diameter. when osteoclast-inducing cytokines are used to convert macrophages to osteoclasts, very large cells that may reach 100 µm in diameter occur. these may have dozens of nuclei, and typically express major osteoclast proteins but have significant differences from cells in living bone because of the not-natural substrate.  the size of the multinucleated assembled osteoclast allows it to focus the ion transport, protein secretory and vesicular transport capabilities of many macrophages on a localized area of bone.


=== location ===
in bone, osteoclasts are found in pits in the bone surface which are called resorption bays, or howship's lacunae. osteoclasts are characterized by a cytoplasm with a homogeneous, ""foamy"" appearance. this appearance is due to a high concentration of vesicles and vacuoles. these vacuoles include lysosomes filled with acid phosphatase. this permits characterization of osteoclasts by their staining for high expression of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (trap) and cathepsin k. osteoclast rough endoplasmic reticulum is sparse, and the golgi complex is extensive.at a site of active bone resorption, the osteoclast forms a specialized cell membrane, the ""ruffled border"", that opposes the surface of the bone tissue.  this extensively folded or ruffled border facilitates bone removal by dramatically increasing the cell surface for secretion and uptake of the resorption compartment contents and is a morphologic characteristic of an osteoclast that is actively resorbing bone.


== development ==
since their discovery in 1873 there has been considerable debate about their origin. three theories were dominant: from 1949 to 1970 the connective tissue origin was popular, which stated that osteoclasts and osteoblasts are of the same lineage, and osteoblasts fuse together to form osteoclasts. after years of controversy it is now clear that these cells develop from the self fusion of macrophages. it was in the beginning of 1980 that the monocyte phagocytic system was recognized as precursor of osteoclasts. osteoclast formation requires the presence of rankl (receptor activator of nuclear factor κβ ligand) and m-csf (macrophage colony-stimulating factor). these membrane-bound proteins are produced by neighbouring stromal cells and osteoblasts, thus requiring direct contact between these cells and osteoclast precursors.
m-csf acts through its receptor on the osteoclast, c-fms (colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor), a transmembrane tyrosine kinase-receptor, leading to secondary messenger activation of tyrosine kinase src. both of these molecules are necessary for osteoclastogenesis and are widely involved in the differentiation of monocyte/macrophage derived cells.
rankl is a member of the tumour necrosis family (tnf), and is essential in osteoclastogenesis. rankl knockout mice exhibit a phenotype of osteopetrosis and defects of tooth eruption, along with an absence or deficiency of osteoclasts. rankl activates nf-κβ (nuclear factor-κβ) and nfatc1 (nuclear factor of activated t cells, cytoplasmic, calcineurin-dependent 1) through rank. nf-κβ activation is stimulated almost immediately after rankl-rank interaction occurs and is not upregulated. nfatc1 stimulation, however, begins ~24–48 hours after binding occurs and its expression has been shown to be rankl dependent.
osteoclast differentiation is inhibited by osteoprotegerin (opg), which is produced by osteoblasts and binds to rankl thereby preventing interaction with rank. it may be important to note that while osteoclasts are derived from the hematopoietic lineage, osteoblasts are derived from mesenchymal stem cells.


== function ==
once activated, osteoclasts move to areas of microfracture in the bone by chemotaxis. osteoclasts lie in small cavities called howship's lacunae, formed from the digestion of the underlying bone. the sealing zone is the attachment of the osteoclast's plasma membrane to the underlying bone. sealing zones are bounded by belts of specialized adhesion structures called podosomes. attachment to the bone matrix is facilitated by integrin receptors, such as αvβ3, via the specific amino acid motif arg-gly-asp in bone matrix proteins, such as osteopontin. the osteoclast releases hydrogen ions through the action of carbonic anhydrase (h2o + co2 → hco3− + h+) through the ruffled border into the resorptive cavity, acidifying and aiding dissolution of the mineralized bone matrix into ca2+, h3po4, h2co3, water and other substances. dysfunction of the carbonic anhydrase has been documented to cause some forms of osteopetrosis.  hydrogen ions are pumped against a high concentration gradient by proton pumps, specifically a unique vacuolar-atpase. this enzyme has been targeted in the prevention of osteoporosis. in addition, several hydrolytic enzymes, such as members of the cathepsin and matrix metalloprotease (mmp) groups, are released to digest the organic components of the matrix. these enzymes are released into the compartment by lysosomes. of these hydrolytic enzymes, cathepsin k is of most importance.


=== cathepsin k and other cathepsins ===
cathepsin k is a collagenolytic, papain-like, cysteine protease that is mainly expressed in osteoclasts, and is secreted into the resorptive pit. cathepsin k is the major protease involved in the degradation of type i collagen and other noncollagenous proteins. mutations in the cathepsin k gene are associated with pycnodysostosis, a hereditary osteopetrotic disease, characterised by a lack of functional cathepsin k expression. knockout studies of cathepsin k in mice lead to an osteopetrotic phenotype, which, is partially compensated by increased expression of proteases other that cathepsin k and enhanced osteoclastogenesis.
cathepsin k has an optimal enzymatic activity in acidic conditions. it is synthesized as a proenzyme with a molecular weight of 37kda, and upon activation by autocatalytic cleavage, is transformed into the mature, active form with a molecular weight of ~27kda.
upon polarization of the osteoclast over the site of resorption, cathepsin k is secreted from the ruffled border into the resorptive pit.  cathepsin k transmigrates across the ruffled border by intercellular vesicles and is then released by the functional secretory domain. within these intercellular vesicles, cathepsin k, along with reactive oxygen species generated by trap, further degrades the bone extracellular matrix.
several other cathepsins are expressed in osteoclasts including cathepsins b, c, d, e, g, and l.  the function of these cysteine and aspartic proteases is generally unknown within bone, and they are expressed at much lower levels than cathepsin k.
studies on cathepsin l knockout mice have been mixed, with a report of reduced trabecular bone in homozygous and heterozygous cathepsin l knockout mice compared to wild-type and another report finding no skeletal abnormalities.


=== matrix metalloproteinases ===
the matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) comprise a family of more than 20 zinc-dependent endopeptidases. the role of matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) in osteoclast biology is ill-defined, but in other tissue they have been linked with tumor promoting activities, such as activation of growth factors and are required for tumor metastasis and angiogenesis.
mmp9 is associated with the bone microenvironment. it is expressed by osteoclasts, and is known to be required for osteoclast migration and is a powerful gelatinase. transgenic mice lacking mmp-9 develop defects in bone development, intraosseous angiogenesis, and fracture repair.
mmp-13 is believed to be involved in bone resorption and in osteoclast differentiation, as knockout mice revealed decreased osteoclast numbers, osteopetrosis, and decreased bone resorption.
mmps expressed by the osteoclast include mmp-9, -10, -12, and -14. apart from mmp-9, little is known about their relevance to the osteoclast, however, high levels of mmp-14 are found at the sealing zone.


=== osteoclast physiology ===
in the 1980s and 90s the physiology of typical osteoclasts was studied in detail.  with the isolation of the ruffled border, ion transport across it was studied directly in biochemical detail. energy-dependent acid transport was verified and the postulated proton pump purified. with the successful culture of osteoclasts, it became apparent that they are organized to support the massive transport of protons for acidification of the resorption compartment and solubilization of the bone mineral.  this includes ruffled border cl− permeability to control membrane potential and basolateral cl−/hco3− exchange to maintain cytosolic ph in physiologically acceptable ranges.the effectiveness of its ion secretion depends upon the osteoclast forming an effective seal around the resorption compartment.  the positioning of this ""sealing zone"" appears to be mediated by integrins expressed on the osteoclast surface. with the sealing zone in place, the multinucleated osteoclast reorganizes itself.  developing the highly invaginated ruffled membrane apposing the resorption compartment allows massive secretory activity.  in addition, it permits the vesicular transcytosis of the mineral and degraded collagen from the ruffled border to the free membrane of the cell, and its release into the extracellular compartment. this activity completes the bone resorption, and both the mineral components and collagen fragments are released to the general circulation.


=== regulation ===
osteoclasts are regulated by several hormones, including parathyroid hormone (pth) from the parathyroid gland, calcitonin from the thyroid gland,  and growth factor interleukin 6 (il-6). this last hormone, il-6, is one of the factors in the disease osteoporosis, which is an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation. osteoclast activity is also mediated by the interaction of two molecules produced by osteoblasts, namely osteoprotegerin and rank ligand. note that these molecules also regulate differentiation of the osteoclast.


== odontoclast ==
an odontoclast (/odon·to·clast/; o-don´to-klast) is an osteoclast associated with absorption of the roots of deciduous teeth.


== alternate use of term ==
an osteoclast can also be an instrument used to fracture and reset bones (the origin is greek osteon: bone and klastos: broken). to avoid confusion, the cell was originally termed osotoclast. when the surgical instrument went out of use, the cell became known by its present name.


== clinical significance ==
giant osteoclasts can occur in some diseases, including paget's disease of bone and bisphosphonate toxicity.
in cats, abnormal odontoclast activity can cause feline odontoclastic resorptive lesions, necessitating extraction of the affected teeth.


== history ==
osteoclasts were discovered by kolliker in 1873.

== plot ==


=== season 1 ===
adam, mira, and kai are three teenagers who awaken in a room with no memories of themselves or each other; the only clue to their identities are their names written on small slips of paper in their pockets. after emerging from an underground bunker they find themselves in a deep forest and venture forth to discover who they are and how to get home.along the way, they encounter a strange character that they call ""weirdy"" or ""the weird guy"", who teleports them to different regions whenever they ask 'help please'. each region, however, harbors dangers and obstacles that the group struggle to overcome, while also discovering that they each possess superpowers; adam has both super strength and agility, mira can communicate with animals, breathe underwater, and swim like a mermaid, and kai can cast and manipulate fire, as well as being a technical whiz.
the trio encounters a large, talking tree who offers to send them home if they can retrieve a stolen branch of hers that has been turned in to a dangerous weapon called the ishibo. while attempting to retrieve it, they also encounter another trio of teens; each with their own superpowers who compete with them for possession of the ishibo.
regardless of the trials and setbacks that follow, the trio emerges victorious over their rivals and claim the ishibo. however, adam's theory that they are in a virtual reality game is confirmed by weirdie, who warns them, that the glitches they have seen are a sign that the game's code is corrupted and is on the verge of crashing, and that they must quickly escape the game.
after returning the ishibo to the iron tree, she enables them to enter a region where they must fight a dragon. after the dragon's defeat, they enter a portal in the building that was being guarded by the dragon. once through the portal, they wind up in the same room they started in, except for the fact that there was a green button. they press it, and exit the game, waking up in a vr tournament (filmed as live-action) where they are greeted by the weirdie (revealed to be the show's host) and cheered by the live audience for winning the game, ""the hollow."" however, as the rival team wakes up, kai notices the eye of vannsa slightly glitching.


=== season 2 ===
adam, kai and mira wake up in a place that is visually identical to their homes, but they still believe they are in the hollow. while exploring this world, they individually find that no one has ever heard of the hollow. when they first meet, adam is running away from his childhood bullies, who have remained the same age. they realize that all of their greatest fears, the bullies for adam, a giant chicken for kai, and a victorian-era doll for mira, have been manifested into the real world. while fighting these fears, they realize that they still have their powers from the hollow. adam and mira agree that they should go to hollow games headquarters, the headquarters of the company that created the hollow game and tournament, the next day. while mira is on her way home, she sees skeet, and decides to go to hollow games headquarters without adam and kai. when adam and kai meet to go, mira doesn't come, so they leave for the headquarters, suspecting that she's there. while they're there, they find a portal, like the ones that appear in the hollow game, and jump into it.
once they go through the portal, they arrive on an island of primitive parrot people, where they find skeet. they then go to a nuclear power plant and see another team of teens with powers. one of the members of this team is shot and killed, so the weird guy appears in order to remove the team from the game. when adam, kai, and skeet see the weird guy, they attempt to get his attention, but aren't able to. while escaping from the power plant, they go through a portal with mira. together, they fight a giant snail, but it kills skeet and they are unable to revive him. the owner of the snail, a scientist, invites them to stay with him. while there, they find reeve and vanessa, who are seemingly under mind control. they defeat the scientist, releasing reeve and vanessa from his control. after leaving the scientist's manor, they find a poster, which features the weird guy, and decide to go find him, in order to get answers. on their way, they run into the other team from this game, who have their equivalent of the ishibo, and battle them. when they find the weird guy, he thinks that they are ""coding errors,"" so he uses a portal to send them elsewhere.
the crew attempt to find the weird guy to get his help, and they convince him that they're real by using his real name. he reveals that the crew are digital copies of their physical selves consciousnesses, taken by the hollow game company for a new game, hollow life, that lets players experience an environment populated by npc versions of past winners of the hollow. they convince the weird guy to disconnect the hollow life server from the hollow game so they can live there in peace. he tells them that while he is doing it, they must not let the game's other team leave the game, by winning or losing. vanessa reveals to everyone that she cheated in season one by using special contact lens to retain her memories to have a better shot at winning the game, which caused the glitch and made their copied consciousnesses self-aware. she is kicked out of the group by adam, mira, and reeve. she sees that the other team is moving on to the final part of the game, and she follows them. adam, kai, mira, and reeve go to the final level and start battling the other team. vanessa rejoins the group and, at the same time the other team wins, the weird guy tells them he's finished and opens a portal. they make it through. the final scenes of the season are adam, kai, mira, reeve, and vanessa having a barbecue at mira's home, followed by a shot of the snail from the hollow game in the hollow life world.

=== lgbtq representation ===

the short-lived series, the hollow, featured various lgbtq+ characters. on may 8, 2020, the show's second season premiered on netflix. the first episode of that season, titled ""home,"" features one of the show's protagonists, an asian girl named mira, was shown to be adopted by her two fathers named paul and curtis and a brother named miles. the second episode featured a hispanic boy named adam who was revealed to be homosexual, as he said that mira, a female protagonist, is ""not his type."" prior to this, in the trailer for season 2 the lgbt pride flag was seen in his room, leading some fans to speculate he was gay. (this flag is also seen right at the beginning of the first episode of season two.) some critics stated that while this was somewhat clear in season one, there is little or no ""romantic entanglement"" for the show's characters in the show's second season, with the show focusing on ""difficult and dramatic friendships"" instead.

paneth cell of epithelium proper of small intestine,cell,"the intestinal epithelium is the single cell layer that form the luminal surface (lining) of both the small and large intestine (colon) of the gastrointestinal tract. composed of simple columnar epithelial cells, it serves two main functions: absorbing useful substances into the body and restricting the entry of harmful substances. as part of its protective role, the intestinal epithelium forms an important component of the intestinal mucosal barrier. certain diseases and conditions are caused by functional defects in the intestinal epithelium. on the other hand, various diseases and conditions can lead to its dysfunction which, in turn, can lead to further complications.


== structure ==
the intestinal epithelium is part of the intestinal mucosa layer. the epithelium is composed of a single layer of cells. the other two layers of the mucosa, the lamina propria and the muscularis mucosae, support and articulate the epithelial layer. to securely contain of the contents of the intestinal lumen, the cells of the epithelial layer are joined together by tight junctions thus forming a contiguous and relatively impermeable membrane.

epithelial cells are continuously renewed every 4–5 days through a process of cell division, maturation, and migration. renewal relies on proliferative cells (stem cells) that reside at the crypt (base) of the intestinal glands (epithelial invaginations into the underlying connective tissue). after being formed at the base, the new cells migrate upwards and out of the crypt, maturing along the way. eventually, they undergo apoptosis and are shed off into the intestinal lumen. in this way, the lining of the intestine is constantly renewed while the number of cells making up the  epithelial layer remains constant.in the small intestine, the mucosal layer is specially adapted to provide a large surface area in order to maximize the absorption of nutrients. the expansion of the absorptive surface, 600 times beyond that of a simple cylindrical tube, is achieved by three anatomical features:
circular folds are transverse folds that slow the passage of the luminal contents and serve to expand the total surface area threefold.
villi and intestinal glands serve to increase the mucosal surface area tenfold. (intestinal villus)
microvilli covering the apical surface of the enterocytes increase the absorptive surface twentyfold. these numerous microscopic (100 nanometers in diameter) finger-like projections form an undulated brush border.the brush border on the apical surface of the epithelial cells is covered with glycocalyx, which is composed of oligosaccharides attached to membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids.


=== cell types ===
seven different cell types are produced by the stem cells that reside at the base of the crypts. each type matures according to its specific differentiation program as it migrates up and out of the crypt. many of the genes necessary for differentiation into the different epithelial cell types have been identified and characterized (see this table). the cell types produced are: enterocytes, goblet cells, enteroendocrine cells, paneth cells, microfold cells, cup cells and tuft cells. their functions are listed here:
enterocytes are the most numerous and function primarily for nutrient absorption. enterocytes express many catabolic enzymes on their exterior luminal surface to break down molecules to sizes appropriate for uptake into the cell. examples of molecules taken up by enterocytes are: ions, water, simple sugars, vitamins, lipids, peptides and amino acids.
goblet cells secrete the mucus layer that protects the epithelium from the lumenal contents.
enteroendocrine cells secrete various gastrointestinal hormones including secretin, pancreozymin, enteroglucagon among others. subsets of sensory intestinal epithelial cells synapse with nerves, and are known as neuropod cells.
paneth cells produce antimicrobial peptides such as human beta-defensin.
microfold cells (commonly referred to as m cells) sample antigens from the lumen and deliver them to the lymphoid tissue associated with the mucosa (malt). in the small intestine, m cells are associated with peyer's patches.
cup cells are a distinct cell type but with no known function.
tuft cells play a part in the immune response.throughout the digestive tract, the distribution of the different types of epithelial cells varies according to the function of that region.


=== structural components of cellular junctions ===

important for the barrier function of intestinal epithelium, its cells are joined securely together by four types of junctions (cell junctions), which can be identified at the ultrastructural level:
gap junctions
desmosomes
adherens junctions
tight junctions


==== gap junctions ====
gap junctions bring the adjacent cells within 2 nanometers of each other. they are formed by several homologous proteins encoded by the connexin gene family coming together to form a multiprotein complex. the molecular structure of this complex is in the form of a hexamer. the complex, which is embedded in the cell walls of the two joined cells, forms a gap or channel in the middle of the six proteins. this channel allows various molecules, ions and electrical impulses to pass between the two cells.


==== desmosomes ====
these complexes, consisting of transmembrane adhesion proteins of the cadherin family, link adjacent cells together through their cytoskeletons. desmosomes leave a gap of 30 nanometers between cells.


==== adherens junctions ====
adherens junctions, also called zonula adherens, are multiprotein complexes formed by proteins of the catenin and cadherin families. they are located in the membrane at the contact points between the cells. they are formed by interactions between intracellular adapter proteins, transmembrane proteins and the actin cytoskeletons of the cells . besides their role in linking adjacent cells, these complexes are important for regulating epithelial migration, cell polarity, and the formation of other cell junction complexes.


==== tight junctions ====
tight junctions, also called zonula occludens, are the most important components of the intestinal epithelium for its barrier function. these complexes, formed primarily of members of the claudin and the occludin families, consist of about 35 different proteins, form a ring shaped continuous ribbon around the cells, and are located near the borders of the lateral and apical membranes.the extracellular domains of the transmembrane proteins in adjacent cells cross connect to form a tight seal. these interactions include those between proteins in the same membrane (""cis"") and proteins in adjacent cells (""trans""). in addition, interactions can be homophilic (between identical proteins) or heterophilic (between different proteins).similar to adherens junctions, the intracellular domains of tight junctions interact with different scaffold proteins, adapter proteins and signaling complexes to regulate cytoskeletal linking, cell polarity, cell signaling and vesical trafficking.tight junctions provide a narrow but modifiable seal between adjacent cells in the epithelial layer and thereby provide selective paracellular transport of solutes. while previously thought to be static structures, tight junctions are now known to be dynamic and can change the size of the opening between cells and thereby adapt to the different states of development, physiologies and pathologies. they function as a selective and semipermeable paracellular barrier between apical and basolateral compartments of the epithelial layer. they function to facilitate the passage of small ions and water-soluble solutes through the paracellular space while preventing the passage of luminal antigens, microorganisms and their toxins.


== physiology ==

the intestinal epithelium has a complex anatomical structure which facilitates motility and coordinated digestive, absorptive, immunological and neuroendocrine functions.the mucus secreted by goblet cells acts as a lubricant and protects the epithelial cell layer against irritation from mucosal contents.traditionally, crypt cells were considered primarily as secretory cells while enterocytes are considered principally absorptive. however, recent studies have challenged this classical functional partitioning and have shown that both the surface and crypt cells can perform both secretory and absorptive functions and that, in fact, these functions can occur simultaneously.


=== nutrient uptake ===
overlaying the brush border of the apical surface of the enterocytes is the glycocalyx, which is a loose network composed of the oligosaccharide side chains of integral membrane hydrolases and other enzymes essential for the digestion of proteins and carbohydrates. these glycoproteins, glycolipids, and enzymes catalyze the final digestive stages of luminal carbohydrates and proteins. the monosaccharides and amino acids thus produced are subsequently transported across the intestinal epithelium and eventually into the bloodstream.the absorption of electrolytes and water is one of the most important functions of the digestive tract. water absorption is passive and isotonic - depending on the speed and direction of solute flow. other factors influencing fluid absorption are osmolarity and the specific intestinal region. regulated selective permeability is performed through two major routes: the transcellular (transepithelial) route and the paracellular route.


=== transcellular permeability ===

this consists of specific transport of solutes across the epithelial cells. it is predominantly regulated by the activities of specialised transporters that translocate specific electrolytes, amino acids, sugars, short chain fatty acids and other molecules into or out of the cell.


=== paracellular permeability ===
paracellular permeability depends on transport through the spaces that exist between epithelial cells. it is regulated by cellular junctions that are localized in the laminal membranes of the cells. this is the main route of passive flow of water and solutes across the intestinal epithelium. regulation depends on the intercellular tight junctions which have the most influence on paracellular transport.  studies using the electron microscope showed that the electrical resistance of epithelial layers depends on the complexity and number of filaments within the tight junction transmembrane protein complexes. also, the plasma membrane resistance and variable transmembrane conductance of the epithelial cells can also modulate paracellular pathway function.


== functions ==
the barrier formed by the intestinal epithelium separates the external environment (the contents of the intestinal lumen) from the body and is the most extensive and important mucosal surface of body.the intestinal epithelium serves several crucial functions, exhibiting both innate and adaptive immune features. it closely monitors its intracellular and extracellular environment, communicates messages to neighbouring cells and rapidly initiates active defensive and repair measures, if necessary. on the one hand, it acts as a barrier, preventing the entry of harmful substances such as foreign antigens, toxins and microorganisms. on the other hand, it acts as a selective filter which facilitates the uptake of dietary nutrients, electrolytes, water and various other beneficial substances from the intestinal lumen.when barrier integrity is lost, intestinal permeability increases and uncontrolled passage of harmful substances can occur. this can lead to, depending on the genetic predisposition of the individual, the development of inflammation, infection, allergies, autoimmune diseases or cancer - within the intestine itself or other organs.although they primarily function as part of the digestive system, enterocytes of the intestinal epithelium also express toll-like receptors and nucleotide oligomerization domain proteins that recognize diverse types of microbes and contribute to immune system function. thus the intestinal epithelium not only serves as a physical barrier separating the intestinal lumen from the body proper but also carries out pathogen recognition functions as part of the intrinsic immune system.


== importance for human health ==
loss of integrity of the intestinal epithelium plays a key pathogenic role in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota are an important environmental factor in the development of ibd. detrimental changes in the intestinal microbiota induce an inappropriate (uncontrolled) immune response that results in damage to the intestinal epithelium. breaches in this critical barrier (the intestinal epithelium) allow further infiltration of microbiota that, in turn, elicit further immune responses. ibd is a multifactorial disease that is nonetheless driven in part by an exaggerated immune response to gut microbiota that causes defects in epithelial barrier function.

active chief cell of parathyroid gland,cell,"parathyroid chief cells (also called parathyroid principal cells or simply parathyroid cells) are one of the two cell types of the parathyroid glands, along with oxyphil cells.  the chief cells are much more prevalent in the parathyroid gland than the oxyphil cells. it is perceived that oxyphil cells may be derived from chief cells at puberty, as they are not present at birth like chief cells.chief cells appear as a dark purple in an h&e stain, with the oxyphil cells staining as a lighter pink.they are polygonal in shape with a round nucleus.


== structure ==
chief cells spend most time inactive due to normal calcium level conditions.  these inactive cells are classified as cuboidal.  they have low levels of secretory granules, as opposed to active chief cells.  these granules can contain acid phosphatase.  acid phosphatase is only found in larger secretory granules, 400 to 900 nm in diameter, and is less prevalent in smaller granules.  this acid phosphatase is also present in the golgi apparatus of the chief cell.  however, the golgi apparatus areas associated with parathyroid hormone packaging contained little or no acid phosphatase.  the chief cells become active in response to low calcium in the blood.  the low level is sensed by the calcium- sensing receptor.  these active cells have a greater electron density than the inactive chief cells.  the electron density is caused by the secretory granules.  the chief cell is thought to have a clear cytoplasm.


== function ==

the parathyroid gland is part of the endocrine system.  most individuals display four parathyroid glands adjacent to the thyroid gland anterior in the neck.  the chief cells are organized as dense cords surrounding the capillaries in the parathyroid.  the thyroid gland and parathyroid gland are closely tied together in the calcium pathway.  the thyroid gland secretes three hormones:  t3, t4, and calcitonin.  when the calcium level in the blood is too high, calcitonin is secreted, and the level is lowered.  calcitonin does this by depositing calcium in the bones.  pth works inversely from calcitonin.  when the level of calcium in the blood is too low, pth is released, and the level of calcium is raised.  calcium is released from the bone storage.  this trigger also retains calcium from the urine, and alerts the intestines to absorb more calcium from ingested nutrients.  too much of either hormone can be an indicator of disease.


=== calcium-sensing receptor (car) ===
the secretion of parathyroid hormone (pth) is regulated by the interaction of the calcium-sensing receptor with calcium in the blood.  the calcium-sensing receptor is present on the plasma membrane of the chief cells.  the car is a g protein-coupled receptor, as part of the c family.  the car is divided into three general domains.  these include an nh2- terminal extracellular end, a cooh-terminal intracellular end, and seven transmembrane domains.  the car interacts positively with phospholipase c (plc) and adenylyl cyclase.  the car includes phosphorylation sites for protein kinase c (pkc) and protein kinase a (pka).  the phosphorylation of the plc is seen to inhibit the secretion of pth due to high calcium levels in the blood.  the function of the pka sites is currently unknown.


== clinical significance ==


=== hyperparathyroidism ===

because the formation of pth regulates the calcium level in the blood, it can affect all areas of the body.  the overactivity of a parathyroid gland is known as hyperparathyroidism.  it is unknown what directly causes hyperparathyroidism.  however there are many factors that can cause over-secretion of pth.  the further consequence of this disorder can be osteopenia, or even osteoporosis, which is the loss of bone density.  this leaves bones more porous, fragile, and likely to experience fracture.  this can be detected by usage of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (dexa).  interesting enough, a derivative of synthetic pth is often given to patients with osteoporosis to combat the disease.


=== vitamin d deficiency ===
vitamin d in the kidney assists in the absorption of calcium in the blood.  some individuals may be vitamin d deficient, which prevents them from retaining calcium.  while their parathyroid gland is functional, it senses a very low level of calcium in the blood and constantly secretes hormone, increasing pth levels.


=== medications ===
there are many drugs that can affect calcium level in the blood, and therefore pth secretion.  for example, many individuals may take a calcium carbonate supplement, which increases the calcium level in the blood.  pth is decreased.  many medications may also increase urination, furthering loss of calcium.


=== parathyroid adenoma ===

a parathyroid adenoma is the most common cause of hyperparathyroidism.  they are more commonly found in women than in men.  in this form, the chief cells mutate to exhibit multiple nuclei.  chief cells in parathyroid adenomas also display acid phosphatase activity.  it is a benign tumor of the gland that requires surgical removal.  these benign adenomas are typically affect only one or two of the parathyroid glands, known respectively as a single adenoma or double adenoma.  typically, no disease is linked to the cause.  a primary adenoma can only develop as a primary cause.


=== chief cell hyperplasia ===
in many way, chief cell hyperplasia is similar to parathyroid adenoma.  the hyperplasia is seen as an enlargement of all four of the parathyroid glands, as opposed to a parathyroid adenoma is viewed as an enlargement of one gland.  chief cell hyperplasia is a common disorder in individuals with other endocrine abnormalities, though it may still occur sporadically.  a chief cell hyperplasia can develop from either a primary or secondary cause.


=== parathyroid carcinoma ===
in extremely rare cases, a malignant tumor may develop within the parathyroid gland.  they can be detected intraoperatively, imaging, or through blood testing.  a thick fibrous capsule is usually present around the gland, as opposed to the thin capsule present in benign adenomas.  parathyroid hormone level is often greater in carcinomas than in benign disorders.


=== hypoparathyroidism ===

there are very few cases of hypoparathyroidism.  most often, it is related with surgical removal of the parathyroid glands.  it can also be due to a head or neck injury and further loss of function of the glands.  hypoparathyroidism can also be linked to a low serum magnesium level in the blood.  serum magnesium is necessary for full secretion of pth.  without the parathyroid glands, there is no trigger to release calcium into the blood.  another consequence of hypoparathyroidism is the lack of calcium in the blood to trigger muscle contraction.  without calcium present, muscles innervation is unable to take place.  this is especially crucial in the function of the most important muscle of the body – the heart.

mount toromocho,non_science,"mount toromocho, meaning in spanish ""a bull with no horns"", is a mountain in the junín region, peru that sits next to the long established mining camp of morococha and hosts a large polymetallic metal deposit. it is now owned by the aluminum corporation of china (chinalco), a parent company of chinalco mining corporation international (cmc). minera chinalco perú s.a., a subsidiary of cmc which operates the toromocho mine, is boosting the mine's productivity with a new production line.


== history ==
the mineralisation on toromocho has been known and mined on a small scale for many years and was drilled by both the cerro de pasco corporation and its successor (after nationalization) centromin between 1966 and 1976 but it was evidently not considered worth exploiting, possibly due to lack of finance in the case of centromin and the spectre of nationalization in the case of cerro, or because it did not look economically viable at the prevailing metal prices.
peru copper inc was formed in february 2004 and took over the toromocho option that had been successfully bid for from centromin by its predecessor company.  the five year option required certain expenditures which peru copper completed satisfactorily and the option was exercised on 5 may 2008.  there is no indication of any further payment for the exercise of the option.
in the meantime on 11 july 2007 chinalco purchased vancouver listed peru copper inc for c$840 million and it became a wholly owned subsidiary of chinalco.  the new owner now plans to establish an open pit copper mine at a cost of us$2.16 billion to produce 210,000 tonnes of copper annually.

much of the technical information comes from a report prepared by independent mining consultants of tucson, arizona entitled toromocho project technical report, prepared for peru copper, inc.the mountain of toromocho is located about 140 km east of lima on the main road to la oroya.  high tension power lines pass close by (although inadequate for toromocho at present) as does the central railroad though part of this may have to be relocated as it runs over the projected limit of the open pit.  it is next to the mining camp of morococha where simsa and pan american operate underground silver/lead/zinc mines. it is not clear how toromocha will affect these operations but it has already been decided to move part of the morococha mining camp. chinalco is offering guaranteed housing and us$2,000 compensation to residents that have to relocate due to the development of the mine, and the offer has been accepted by a majority of the population via a referendum according to a bbc report.the deposit is very high with elevations over the deposit ranging from 4,700 metres (15400 feet) to 4,900 metres (16,100 feet).  neither humans nor diesel powered machinery work very well at that altitude as anyone who travels up from lima on the main road over the 4,818 metre (15,800 feet) el ticlio pass realises as the engine starts to struggle towards the top.  also there is anecdotal evidence of geologists being quite unable to understand their notes made on top of the mountain due to the befuddling of their minds by the lack of oxygen.  hence, the early years of the development of the mine may not easily be progressed.
the deposit is complex but has the general characteristics of a porphyry copper.  it consists of a core of copper with molybdenum and silver, surrounded by a lead/zinc zone then a lead/silver zone that is being mined to the north-east of toromocho by various small companies.  it has been mined on a small scale in the past and the underground workings have proved to be valuable drill sites.  the ore reserves and resources released in the imc technical report were as follows:

proven and probable reserves 1,375 million tonnes grading 0.51% copper, 0.018% molybdenum and 7.06 g/tonnes silver.
resources were estimated at 601 million tonnes grading 0.37% copper, 0.016% molybdenum and 6.82 g/tonne silver.using the recoveries estimated by imc, the recoverable metal from the reserves would be 5.7 million tonnes of copper, 148,000 tonnes molybdenum and 188 million ounces of silver, giving a life of over 25 years at an average production rate of 210,000 tonnes copper annually, plus another 8 years if the resources prove payable, a total of 35 years.


== the mine ==
chinalco estimate that it will cost us$2.16b to bring the toromocho mine to production in 2012 and that annual production will be 210,000 tonnes copper.operating costs are likely to be relatively high per pound of copper despite a low stripping ratio (the amount of waste that has to be moved to access the ore), again due to the low grade coupled with the adverse working conditions.   on the other hand, the molybdenum and silver will be very valuable sources of byproduct income which at current prices could cover operating costs.
metallurgically the concentrate is likely to be relatively complex.  it will contain arsenic which could well incur smelter penalties in the early years because of the enargite (cu3ass4) in the top of the deposit.  the zinc and antimony are unlikely to be a problem.  a more serious problem is the presence of variable quantities of talc which  come out with the copper/molybdenum concentrate and tend to depress the copper grade of the concentrate.  sodium carboxymethylcellulose (cmc), will suppress the talc in the flotation process but it has the unfortunate side effect of reducing molybdenum recovery.  it gives a higher grade copper concentrate but also lower recovery.  a high grade copper concentrate is very desirable because smelters generally deduct 1% from the copper content which is a higher percentage of a low grade concentrate than a high one.

squamosa promoter-binding-like protein 3 (arabidopsis thaliana),protein,"the abc model of flower development is a scientific model of the process by which flowering plants produce a pattern of gene expression in meristems that leads to the appearance of an organ oriented towards sexual reproduction, a flower. there are three physiological developments that must occur in order for this to take place: firstly, the plant must pass from sexual immaturity into a sexually mature state (i.e. a transition towards flowering); secondly, the transformation of the apical meristem's function from a vegetative meristem into a floral meristem or inflorescence; and finally the growth of the flower's individual organs. the latter phase has been modelled using the abc model, which aims to describe the biological basis of the process from the perspective of molecular and developmental genetics.
an external stimulus is required in order to trigger the differentiation of the meristem into a flower meristem. this stimulus will activate mitotic cell division in the apical meristem, particularly on its sides where new primordia are formed. this same stimulus will also cause the meristem to follow a developmental pattern that will lead to the growth of floral meristems as opposed to vegetative meristems. the main difference between these two types of meristem, apart from the obvious disparity between the objective organ, is the verticillate (or whorled) phyllotaxis, that is, the absence of stem elongation among the successive whorls or verticils of the primordium. these verticils follow an acropetal development, giving rise to sepals, petals, stamens and carpels. another difference from vegetative axillary meristems is that the floral meristem is ""determined"", which means that, once differentiated, its cells will no longer divide.the identity of the organs present in the four floral verticils is a consequence of the interaction of at least three types of gene products, each with distinct functions. according to the abc model, functions a and c are required in order to determine the identity of the verticils of the perianth and the reproductive verticils, respectively. these functions are exclusive and the absence of one of them means that the other will determine the identity of all the floral verticils. the b function allows the differentiation of petals from sepals in the secondary verticil, as well as the differentiation of the stamen from the carpel on the tertiary verticil.
goethe's foliar theory was formulated in the 18th century and it suggests that the constituent parts of a flower are structurally modified leaves, which are functionally specialized for reproduction or protection. the theory was first published in 1790 in the essay ""metamorphosis of plants"" (""versuch die metamorphose der pflanzen zu erklären""). where goethe wrote:

""...we may equally well say that a stamen is a contracted petal, as that a petal is a stamen in a state of expansion; or that a sepal is a contracted stem leaf approaching a certain stage of refinement, as that a stem leaf is a sepal expanded by the influx of cruder saps"".


== floral transition ==
the transition from the vegetative phase to a reproductive phase involves a dramatic change in the plant's vital cycle, perhaps the most important one, as the process must be carried out correctly in order to guarantee that the plant produces descendants. this transition is characterised by the induction and development of the meristem of the inflorescence, which will produce a collection of flowers or one flower, where only one is produced. this morphogenetic change contains both endogenous and exogenous elements: for example, in order for the change to be initiated the plant must have a certain number of leaves and contain a certain level of total biomass. certain environmental conditions are also required such as a characteristic photoperiod. plant hormones play an important part in the process, with the gibberellins having a particularly important role.there are many signals that regulate the molecular biology of the process. the following three genes in arabidopsis thaliana possess both common and independent functions in floral transition: flowering locus t (ft), leafy (lfy), suppressor of overexpression of constans1 (soc1, also called agamous-like20). soc1 is a mads-box-type gene, which integrates responses to photoperiod, vernalization and gibberellins.


== formation of the floral meristem or the inflorescence ==
the meristem can be defined as the tissue or group of plant tissues that contain undifferentiated stem cells, which are capable of producing any type of cell tissue. their maintenance and development, both in the vegetative meristem or the meristem of the inflorescence is controlled by genetic cell fate determination mechanisms. this means that a number of genes will directly regulate, for example, the maintenance of the stem cell's characteristics (gene wuschel or wus), and others will act via negative feedback mechanisms in order to inhibit a characteristic (gene clavata or clv). in this way both mechanisms give rise to a feedback loop, which along with other elements lend a great deal of robustness to the system. along with the wus gene the shootmeristemless (stm) gene also represses the differentiation of the meristematic dome. this gene acts by inhibiting the possible differentiation of the stem cells but still allows cell division in the daughter cells, which, had they been allowed to differentiate, would have given rise to distinct organs.


== floral architecture ==

a flower's anatomy, as defined by the presence of a series of organs (sepals, petals, stamens and carpels) positioned according to a given pattern, facilitate sexual reproduction in flowering plants. the flower arises from the activity of three classes of genes, which regulate floral development: genes which regulate the identity of the meristem, the identity of the flower organ and finally cadastral genes.
meristem identity genes. code for the transcription factors required to initiate the induction of the identity genes. they are positive regulators of organ identity during floral development.
organ identity genes. directly control organ identity and also code for transcription factors that control the expression of other genes, whose products are implicated in the formation or function of the distinct organs of the flower.
cadastral genes. act as spatial regulators for the organ identity genes by defining boundaries for their expression. in this way they control the extent to which genes interact thereby regulating whether they act in the same place at the same time.


=== the abc model ===
the abc model of flower development was first formulated by george haughn and chris somerville in 1988. it was first used as a model to describe the collection of genetic mechanisms that establish floral organ identity in the rosids, as exemplified by arabidopsis thaliana, and the asterids, as demonstrated by antirrhinum majus. both species have four verticils (sepals, petals, stamens and carpels), which are defined by the differential expression of a number of homeotic genes present in each verticil. this means that the sepals are solely characterized by the expression of a genes, while the petals are characterized by the co-expression of a and b genes. the b and c genes establish the identity of the stamens and the carpels only require c genes to be active. type a and c genes are reciprocally antagonistic.the fact that these homeotic genes determine an organ's identity becomes evident when a gene that represents a particular function, for example the a gene, is not expressed. in arabidopsis this loss results in a flower which is composed of one verticil of carpels, another containing stamens and another of carpels. this method for studying gene function uses reverse genetics techniques to produce transgenic plants that contain a mechanism for gene silencing through rna interference. in other studies, using forward genetics techniques such as genetic mapping, it is the analysis of the phenotypes of flowers with structural anomalies that leads to the cloning of the gene of interest. the flowers may possess a non-functional or over expressed allele for the gene being studied.the existence of two supplementary functions, d and e, have also been proposed in addition to the a, b and c functions already discussed. function d specifies the identity of the ovule, as a separate reproductive function from the development of the carpels, which occurs after their determination. function e relates to a physiological requirement that is a characteristic of all floral verticils, although, it was initially described as necessary for the development of the three innermost verticils (function e sensu stricto). however, its broader definition (sensu lato) suggests that it is required in the four verticils. therefore, when function d is lost the structure of the ovules becomes similar to that of leaves and when function e is lost sensu stricto, the floral organs of the three outer most verticils are transformed into sepals, while on losing function e sensu lato, all the verticils are similar to leaves. the gene products of genes with d and e functions are also mads-box genes.


=== genetic analysis ===

the methodology for studying flower development involves two steps. firstly, the identification of the exact genes required for determining the identity of the floral meristem. in a. thaliana these include apetala1 (ap1) and leafy (lfy). secondly, genetic analysis is carried out on the aberrant phenotypes for the relative characteristics of the flowers, which allows the characterization of the homeotic genes implicated in the process.


==== analysis of mutants ====
there are a great many mutations that affect floral morphology, although the analysis of these mutants is a recent development. supporting evidence for the existence of these mutations comes from the fact that a large number affect the identity of floral organs. for example, some organs develop in a location where others should develop. this is called homeotic mutation, which is analogous to hox gene mutations found in drosophila. in arabidopsis and antirrhinum, the two taxa on which models are based, these mutations always affect adjacent verticils. this allows the characterization of three classes of mutation, according to which verticils are affected:

mutations in type a genes, these mutations affect the calyx and corolla, which are the outermost verticils. in these mutants, such as apetala2 in a. thaliana, carpels develop instead of sepals and stamen in place of petals. this means that, the verticils of the perianth are transformed into reproductive verticils.
mutations in type b genes, these mutations affect the corolla and the stamen, which are the intermediate verticils. two mutations have been found in a. thaliana, apetala3 and pistillata, which cause development of sepals instead of petals and carpels in the place of stamen.
mutations in type c genes, these mutations affect the reproductive verticils, namely the stamen and the carpels. the a. thaliana mutant of this type is called agamous, it possesses a phenotype containing petals instead of stamen and sepals instead of carpels.


==== techniques for detecting differential expression ====
cloning studies have been carried out on dna in the genes associated with the affected homeotic functions in the mutants discussed above. these studies used serial analysis of gene expression throughout floral development to show patterns of tissue expression, which, in general, correspond with the predictions of the abc model.
the nature of these genes corresponds to that of transcription factors, which, as expected, have analogous structures to a group of factors contained in yeasts and animal cells. this group is called mads, which is an acronym for the different factors contained in the group. these mads factors have been detected in all the vegetable species studied, although the involvement of other elements involved in the regulation of gene expression cannot be discounted.


=== genes exhibiting type-a function ===
in a. thaliana, function a is mainly represented by two genes apetala1 (ap1) and apetala2 (ap2) ap1 is a mads-box type gene, while ap2 belongs to the family of genes that contains ap2, which it gives its name to and which consists of transcription factors that are only found in plants. ap2 has also been shown to complex with the co-repressor topless (tpl) in developing floral buds to repress the c-class gene agamous (ag). however, ap2 is not expressed in the shoot apical meristem (sam), which contains the latent stem cell population throughout the adult life of arabidopsis, and so it is speculated that tpl works with some other a-class gene in the sam to repress ag.ap1 functions as a type a gene, both in controlling the identity of sepals and petals, and it also acts in the floral meristem. ap2 not only functions in the first two verticils, but also in the remaining two, in developing ovules and even in leaves. it is also likely that post-transcriptional regulation exists, which controls its a function, or even that it has other purposes in the determination of organ identity independent of that mentioned here.in antirrhinum, the orthologous gene to ap1 is squamosa (squa), which also has a particular impact on the floral meristem. the homologs for ap2 are lipless1 (lip1) and lipless2 (lip2), which have a redundant function and are of special interest in the development of sepals, petals and ovules.a total of three genes have been isolated from petunia hybrida that are similar to ap2: p. hybrida apetala2a (phap2a), phap2b and phap2c. phap2a is, to a large degree, homologous with the ap2 gene of arabidopsis, both in its sequence and in its expression pattern, which suggests that the two genes are orthologs. the proteins phap2b and phap2c, on the other hand, are slightly different, even though they belong to the family of transcription factors that are similar to ap2. in addition they are expressed in different ways, although they are very similar in comparison with phap2a. in fact, the mutants for these genes do not show the usual phenotype, that of the null alleles of a genes. a true a-function gene has not been found in petunia; though a part of the a-function (the inhibition of the c in the outer two whorls) has been largely attributed to mirna169 (colloquially called blind)ref.


=== genes exhibiting type-b function ===
in a. thaliana the type-b function mainly arises from two genes, apetala3 (ap3) and pistillata (pi), both of which are mads-box genes. a mutation of either of these genes causes the homeotic conversion of petals into sepals and of stamens into carpels. this also occurs in its orthologs in a. majus, which are deficiens (def) and globosa (glo) respectively. for both species the active form of binding with dna is that derived from the heterodimer: ap3 and pi, or def and glo, dimerize. this is the form in which they are able to function.the glo/pi lines that have been duplicated in petunia contain p. hybrida globosa1 (phglo1, also called fbp1) and also phglo2 (also called pmads2 or fbp3). for the functional elements equivalent to ap3/def in petunia there is both a gene that possesses a relatively similar sequence, called phdef and there is also an atypical b function gene called phtm6. phylogenetic studies have placed the first three within the «euap3» lineage, while phtm6 belongs to that of «paleoap3». it is worth pointing out that, in terms of evolutionary history, the appearance of the euap3 line seems to be related with the emergence of dicotyledons, as representatives of euap3-type b function genes are present in dicotyledons while paleoap3 genes are present in monocotyledons and basal angiosperms, among others.as discussed above, the floral organs of eudicotyledonous angiosperms are arranged in 4 different verticils, containing the sepals, petals, stamen and carpels. the abc model states that the identity of these organs is determined by the homeotic genes a, a+b, b+c and c, respectively. in contrast with the sepal and petal verticils of the eudicots, the perigone of many plants of the family liliaceae have two nearly identical external petaloid verticils (the tepals). in order to explain the floral morphology of the liliaceae, van tunen et al. proposed a modified abc model in 1993. this model suggests that class b genes are not only expressed in verticils 2 and 3, but also in 1. it therefore follows that the organs of verticils 1 and 2 express class a and b genes and this is how they have a petaloid structure. this theoretical model has been experimentally proven through the cloning and characterization of homologs of the antirrhinum genes globosa and deficiens in a liliaceae, the tulip tulipa gesneriana. these genes are expressed in verticils 1,2 and 3.
the homologs globosa and deficiens have also been isolated and characterized in agapanthus praecox ssp. orientalis (agapanthaceae), which is phylogenetically distant from the model organisms. in this study the genes were called apglo and apdef, respectively. both contain open reading frames that code for proteins with 210 to 214 amino acids. phylogenetic analysis of these sequences indicated that they belong to b gene family of the monocotyledons. in situ hybridization studies revealed that both sequences are expressed in verticil 1 as well as in 2 and 3. when taken together, these observations show that the floral development mechanism of agapanthus also follows the modified abc model.


=== genes exhibiting type-c function ===
in a. thaliana, the c function is derived from one mads-box type gene called agamous (ag), which intervenes both in the establishment of stamen and carpel identity as well as in the determination of the floral meristem. therefore, the ag mutants are devoid of androecium and gynoecium and they have petals and sepals in their place. in addition, the growth in the centre of the flower is undifferentiated, therefore the petals and sepals grow in repetitive verticils.
the plena (ple) gene is present in a. majus, in place of the ag gene, although it is not an ortholog. however, the farinelli (far) gene is an ortholog, which is specific to the development of the anthers and the maturation of pollen.in petunia, antirrhinum and in maize the c function is controlled by a number of genes that act in the same manner. the genes that are closer homologs of ag in petunia are pmads3 and floral-binding protein 6 (fbp6).


=== genes exhibiting type-d and e functions ===
the d function genes were discovered in 1995. these genes are mads-box proteins and they have a function that is distinct from those previously described, although they have a certain homology with c function genes. these genes are called floral binding protein7 (fbp7) and floral binding protein1l (fbp1l). it was found that, in petunia, they are involved in the development of the ovule. equivalent genes were later found in arabidopsis, where they are also involved in controlling the development of carpels and the ovule and even with structures related to seed dispersal.
the appearance of interesting phenotypes in rna interference studies in petunia and tomato led, in 1994, to the definition of a new type of function in the floral development model. the e function was initially thought to be only involved in the development of the three innermost verticils, however, subsequent work found that its expression was required in all the floral verticils.

alexander graf,non_science,"count alexander von stauffenberg (german: alexander franz clemens maria schenk graf von stauffenberg; 15 march 1905, in stuttgart – 27 january 1964, in munich) was a german aristocrat and historian.  his twin brother berthold schenk graf von stauffenberg and younger brother claus schenk graf von stauffenberg were among the leaders of the 20 july plot against hitler in 1944.


== early life ==
the brothers were born into the old and distinguished aristocratic south german catholic stauffenberg family. their parents were the last oberhofmarschall of the kingdom of württemberg, alfred schenk graf von stauffenberg, and caroline née gräfin von üxküll-gyllenband. among alexander's ancestors were several famous prussians, including august von gneisenau. his name points to the imperial hohenstaufen mountain and castle.
alexander schenk graf von stauffenberg went to school in stuttgart and studied ancient history at the university of heidelberg, university of jena, university of munich and university of halle. he and his brothers were introduced by albrecht von blumenthal to the circle of the mystic symbolist poet stefan george, many of whose followers later worked for the german resistance to national socialism.


== career ==
alexander earned a ph.d. in 1928 in halle and habilitated in 1931 at the university of würzburg about hiero ii of syracuse. he lectured at the university of berlin, university of gießen, and  at würzburg, where he was appointed assistant professor in 1936 and professor in 1941, after having been wounded in russia. he accepted a call to the reichsuniversität straßburg in december 1942, but had to serve in the army again, first at the eastern front, where he was wounded again in late 1943. he used the time to finish a book about stefan george, called tod des meisters. in july 1944, alexander was in athens as a lieutenant at the artillery command of the 68th army corps.


== 20 july hitler assassination plot ==
because of alexander's tendency to be outspoken, and because his wife was of jewish ancestry, his brothers refrained from telling him about their plot to assassinate the führer. on 11 august 1937 at berlin-wilmersdorf, alexander had married the aviator and aeronautical engineer melitta schiller, who had been released from the german dvl institute in 1936 probably due to her criticism of the regime and her lack of full aryan status. although she had been reinstated and was very active developing and testing war planes, she might nevertheless have been under surveillance.


=== post-plot ===
after the 20 july plot failed, alexander did not take the opportunity to escape to egypt but returned to berlin to defend himself. he was arrested, as his wife and all others bearing the family name had been. after his arrest, stauffenberg told the gestapo that he: “took the view that the jewish question should have been dealt with in a ""less extreme manner"" because then it would have produced less disturbance among the population” although his brothers were executed and the rest of the adult family members were held in concentration camps, alexander's wife melitta schenk gräfin von stauffenberg was released on 2 september 1944, because of her importance in the development of aircraft. she was now called ""gräfin schenk"", since hitler wanted to erase the name stauffenberg. she still maintained contact and support for the imprisoned members of the family. in the final weeks of the war, as melitta tried to catch up to her husband her aircraft was shot down by an american fighter; she died hours later of injuries from the attack and crash-landing.
in late april 1945, alexander schenk graf von stauffenberg was transferred to tyrol together with about 140 other prominent inmates of the dachau concentration camp, where the ss left the prisoners behind. he was liberated by the fifth u.s. army on 5 may 1945.


== postwar ==
in 1948, alexander graf stauffenberg became a professor of ancient history at the university of munich, where he remained until his death. in 1951, he became the founder and first president of the kommission für alte geschichte und epigraphik, which became a part of the german archaeological institute. his field of research focused on late antiquity, ancient sicily, and magna graecia.


== personal life ==
he remarried on 23 july 1949 marlene hoffmann, born at gross roppershausen (now großropperhausen) on 10 july 1913. he had no issue by either of his marriages.
